  "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France must cut its dependence on U.S. components in its weapons systems to minimize Washington\u2019s ability to block its arms exports, its defense minister said on Thursday.\n\nFrench Defence minister Florence Parly and her Finnish counterpart Jussi Niinisto (not pictured) during a joint news conference in Helsinki, Finland, August 23, 2018. Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen/via REUTERS\n\nU.S. export control laws can be used to limit European weapons sales if even small components come from U.S. suppliers. That legislation was in place prior to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but the industry has grown increasingly worried that his administration is acting to halt exports that might have been permitted in the past.\n\nWashington has this year blocked the sale to Egypt of French-made SCALP cruise missiles, which contain a U.S. part.\n\nWithout giving specific examples, Defence Minister Florence Parly said France needed to \u201cgradually wean ourselves off our reliance on a certain number of American parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had trade difficulties linked to the prospects for exports. And we know that these difficulties are linked to strategic questions and often to problems of commercial rivalry,\u201d she told a small group of journalists.\n\nShe was quizzed on the subject in July by parliament\u2019s defense committee.\n\nAsked at that time by one lawmaker about the blocked SCALP sale, Parly said: \u201cWe are at the mercy of the Americans.\u201d\n\nParly said Washington\u2019s actions underlined the need to minimize dependence on U.S. parts in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) project - Europe\u2019s next-generation combat jet which France and Germany are taking the lead in developing.\n\nFrance\u2019s Dassault Aviation and European planemaker Airbus have signed a deal to work together on the jet, which is expected to be at the center of a broader weapons system capable of commanding a squadron of drones.\n\nFrance\u2019s air force uses Reaper drones, built by U.S. firm General Atomics, in its counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militants. Parly said France had needed U.S. congressional approval to arm the drones.\n\n\u201cIs that satisfactory? No. But we don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she said."
