However, it is expected that UCAV can carry multiple mission payloads to include: electro-optical/infrared units, multi-mode maritime surveillance radar, laser designators, and various weapons packages.\n\nCombat air vehicle will be able to carry a range of anti-radiation, anti-ship, and precision air-to-ground missiles, and guided bombs. UCAV also will be equipped with onboard equipment to enable laser-guided missile, which possesses highly accurate.\n\n\u201cThe work on this project is a priority and received endorsed by number Armed Forces and potential customers in the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region,\u201d the company spokesperson said.\n\nMENA defense spending is expected to rise in the next few years and this to open market for new heavy unmanned aerial systems carrying lethal payloads. The UCAV fleet in the region is forecast to increase from dozens of aircraft in 2018 up to 700 combat drones in 2028 driven by the growing number and intensity of local conflicts.\n\nScience Technology is a Saudi Arabian corporation that was established to facilitate the development, production and export of high-tech industrial products designed for civilian and military applications. Science Technology is an established player in the Saudi defense market with a proven track record of sales collaboration with all major KSA military and homeland security government agencies."
