  "text": "PARIS \u2014 Naval Group, a French shipbuilder, sought to play down media reports of a potential collapse of talks for a major contract with Australia for 12 ocean-going submarines, with elections looming next year in the Commonwealth nation.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of pursuing the strategic partnering agreement,\u201d a Naval Group spokesman told Defense News. That agreement covers some 30 years and is an extremely close commitment, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is plain logic that that takes time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not particularly worried. We remain confident.\"\n\nNaval Group is working under a 2016 design and mobilization contract on the Australian future submarine program, while negotiating the strategic partnering agreement. The latter is a critical contract which moves the French company closer to building the diesel-electric boats in Adelaide under an Australian $50 billion (U.S. $36 billion) deal.\n\nAustralia officially announces $26B frigate contract. Here are the build details Who's building and contributing what for Australia's Future Frigate, and what technology is involved in the Type 26 design?\n\nThere is concern that failure to reach consensus on intellectual property and warranty conditions have held up a signing of the strategic partnering agreement, with time running out, Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\n\u201cNegotiations on that document have stalled and it is feared they may not be resolved before next year\u2019s federal election,\u201d ABC reported. Signing the strategic partnering agreement by the end of this year is needed to allow detailed design contracts to be finalized and building of the boats, the broadcaster reported.\n\nIn Australia, Defense Minister Christopher Pyne sought to calm the waters with an Oct. 1 reply on social media.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThere is no delay to the delivery of 12 Future Submarines. Negotiation of strategic partnering agreement is continuing & we will ensure we end up with an equitable & enduring agreement to deliver the capability our servicemen & women need, and get the best deal for Australian taxpayer.\u201d"
