Allies routinely conduct maritime surveillance from an Icelandic base, where NATO tracks Russian military movements in the north Atlantic and Arctic.\n\n\u201cYour strategic location in the Atlantic helps to bind North America and Europe together,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe Arctic has emerged as a high-profile security issue for the U.S. and NATO. The concerns stem from melting ice that will eventually open long-closed sea lanes, and a Russian military buildup in the region that could exploit the situation. China also is looking to gain a foothold in the Arctic in what U.S. European Command officials have called an \u201ceconomic charm offensive.\u201d\n\nAdm. James Foggo, head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, said last month that the Arctic \u201cpresents a new challenge for freedom of the seas.\u201d\n\nRussian forces have reoccupied seven former Soviet bases in the Arctic Circle and built other new bases in the region, Foggo said.\n\n\u201cThey have renewed their capabilities in the North Atlantic and are aggressively extending their reach in the Arctic,\u201d Foggo said in a command podcast. \u201cThe improved capability of Russia to project power into this region, from the Northern Sea Route to the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap, is something that we must pay particular attention to.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Iceland, its strategic location has been important for NATO dating back to the Cold War, when U.S. troops were based there. The country also played a large role in hosting allied forces in 2018 when NATO held one of its largest exercises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, despite majority support for membership in Iceland\u2019s parliament, the country\u2019s left-wing prime minister has staked out a rare position as a NATO head of state opposed to alliance membership.\n\n\u201cMy personal position is that we should leave NATO, so I am critical towards any increased militarization of the North Atlantic, but our government will stick to the security policy that we have agreed upon and a part of that policy is our membership of NATO,\u201d Jakobsdottir said in November, as quoted by Arctic Today.\n\nOn Tuesday, she did not address the issue of NATO membership, but said security in the Arctic is in everyone\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cFirstly, we talked about the Arctic, and I think we share concerns,\u201d Jakobsdottir said. \u201cThe Arctic should stay a low-tension zone.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg said institutions like NATO play a role in maintaining order in \u201cuncertain and unpredictable times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to try to continue to work to maintain low tensions in the High North despite the fact that we see more military presence, especially of Russian capabilities, up here,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92019 the Stars and Stripes\n\nVisit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
