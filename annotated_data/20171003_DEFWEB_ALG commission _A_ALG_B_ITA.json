Algeria\u2019s order for the vessel emerged in late 2014 when it was confirmed that it had signed a contract for a single vessel, plus an option for a second. Intermarine was originally reported to be in negotiations with Algeria regarding the vessel in 2013 and at Euronaval 2014 Intermarine announced it had started working on a mine countermeasures vessel for an unspecified customer, which turned out to be Algeria.\n\nOrizzonte Sistemi Navali acted as prime contractor, while Intermarine carried out most of the work as a subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to IHS Jane\u2019s, the vessels is based on the Katanpaa class vessels built for the Finnish Navy.
