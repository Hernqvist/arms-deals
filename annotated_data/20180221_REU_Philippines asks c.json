  "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines on Wednesday asked a court to declare the communist party and its armed wing, the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), a terrorist organization, dashing already faint hopes of a recovery in a tattered peace process.\n\nThe petition before a Manila regional trial court seeks to formally terminate peace talks with Maoist rebels, a week after a Norwegian diplomat met President Rodrigo Duterte to try to convince him to restart negotiations that Duterte had scrapped in anger at what he considers duplicity by the communists.\n\nThe Philippines has a state policy to not negotiate with any group defined as terrorists, like the Abu Sayyaf militants behind extremism, kidnapping, banditry and piracy. The United States has since early 2000s listed Abu Sayyaf and the NPA as terrorist organizations.\n\nState Prosecutor Peter Ong said the rebels are \u201cmerely buying time by deceiving the Philippine government in entering into peace talks\u201d because their main agenda was to overthrow the duly constituted authorities.\n\nDuterte is particularly aggrieved by the failure of a peace process that he made a priority and restarted in August 2016 within a few weeks of taking office. He freed some communist leaders from jail and gave cabinet posts to several known leftists as a show of good faith.\n\nThe petition comes on the same day Duterte is set to host a dinner for a group of dozens of former NPA guerrillas who surrendered. Most of the former rebels have not been to the capital and were given tour of parks and malls.\n\nMore than 40,000 people had died in the Maoist rebellion waged by about 3,000 guerrillas for nearly 50 years, attacking mines, plantations, public infrastructure projects and remote army and police outposts in poor rural areas.\n\nThe on-again, off-again negotiations with The Netherlands-based exiled rebel leaders, which started in 1986, were brokered by Norway."
