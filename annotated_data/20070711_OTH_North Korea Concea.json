  "text": "North Korea Concealed National Defense Budget behind People\u2019s Economic Expenses in the 60\u2019s~\u201970\u2019s.\n\nA study was published on the North Korean authorities\u2019 concealment of national defense expenditure.\n\nThe Research Institute of Social Sciences at the University of Ulsan reported a study conducted by Lee Dal Hee a professor of public policy at the university which outlined North Korea\u2019s hidden national defense expenditures. Professor Lee claimed that part of North Korea\u2019s national defense expenses had been concealed behind \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d of the people\u2019s economic expenses.\n\nIt has been doubtful that the North Korea\u2019s national defense expenditures revealed officially didn\u2019t accord with expanded military forces in practice.\n\nThe study analyzed documents such as assembly proceedings by the North Korean People\u2019s Committee in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s and a yearbook of North Korea. The study detected that \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d excluded from the People\u2019s economic expenses were omitted from the official financial budget.\n\nThough there are some difficulties in applying this analysis to the present time taking into account that the analysis was based on documents made 30-40 years ago, this study is significant considering that it may provide a clue to the mishaps of North Korea\u2019s obscure national defense expenditures.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s national expenditure is divided into major departments including the people\u2019s economic expenses, social and cultural expenses, military expenses and administrative expenses.\n\nOn the agenda of the People\u2019s economic expenses is \u201ccommodities and reserved production.\u201d These expenses form part of the commodities and production capital which is used to acquire war materials and materials for national defense. Here, war materials indicate military supplies such as ammunitions and guns, whereas materials for national defense represent items such as oil and food used in the military.\n\nBased on the cost of construction balance from the People\u2019s economic expenditure from 1967~1971, the study analyzes that 30~40% of funds, in fact 5~8 hundred million won had been concealed from the official budget. At the time, 2.16 North Korea won was worth $1 according to an official fixed exchange rate.\n\nThis year, North Korea estimated its national budget to balance at 433.2 trillion won ($30.9bn, $1-141won). Further, North Korea estimated its national defense budget to make up 15.8% of the budget, quoting 68.47 trillion won ($489mn)."
