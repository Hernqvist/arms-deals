  "text": "The Nigerian Air Force is apparently getting ready to take delivery of Yabhon Flash-20 unmanned aerial vehicles and Mi-35 attack helicopters.\n\nNigeria is apparently acquiring an additional 15 Mi-35M attack helicopters from Russia and Adcom Systems Yabhon Flash-20 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from the United Arab Emirates. Some of the UAVs and three helicopters are supposed to arrive in November this year.\n\nNigerian media report that the Yabhon Flash-20 UAVs will replace the CH-3 armed UAVs acquired from China. One crashed in January 2015 and the type has apparently been problematic in Nigerian service. They have been armed with AR-1 missiles, and used to strike Boko Haram positions.\n\nThe Yabhon Flash 20 is the smallest of Adcom Systems\u2019 UAVs at about 1.5 tonnes maximum take-off weight. It can fly for 60-70 hours and carries a gimbaled camera platform.\n\nNigeria also has Aerostar UAVs and some indigenous designs in service such as the Gulma.\n\nSource: Defence Web"
