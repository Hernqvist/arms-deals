The exact number of S-400 units to be delivered has not been publicly confirmed to date. It is also unclear what missile types Russia has sold to China for the air defense systems.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe standard S-400 battery consists of four transporter erector launchers (TELs), four launch tubes per TEL, in addition to target acquisition and engagement (fire control) radar systems and a command post. (With an additional fire control radar system, a battery can consist of up to 12 TELs.) Two batteries make up a S-400 battalion (also known as a S-400 division), whereas a S-400 regiment consists of two battalions.\n\nConsequently, China could receive anywhere between 60 to over 200 TELs including missiles and associated equipment. The S-400 Triumf is one of the world\u2019s most advanced interceptor-based missile defense systems, as I explained elsewhere:\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, the S-300, the S-400 air defense system features an improved radar system and updated software; it can purportedly fire four new types of surface-to-air (SAM) missiles in addition to the S-300\u2019s 48N6E, a vertical tube launched, solid fuel, single stage SAM with an estimated range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and the improved 48N6E2 missile with a reported range of 195 kilometers (121 miles). One of the S-400\u2019s new missiles is the so-called 40N6 SAM with an estimated operational range of 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) and an altitude of up to 185 kilometers (607,000 feet). The missile is reportedly capable of exo-atmospheric interception of intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads in their terminal phase. However, it is unclear whether the weapon is operational in Russia yet and no images of the 40N6 SAM have surfaced so far. The S-400 is also armed with an improved variant of the 48N6E2 with an alleged range of 250 kilometers (160 miles). The air defense system can also fire two additional missiles, the 9M96E and 9M96E2 with respective ranges of 40 km (25 miles) and 120 km (75 miles). Improved S-300 air defense systems such as the S-300PMU-2 Favorite \u2026 can purportedly also fire the 9M96E and 9M96E2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has recently deployed additional S-400 units to its Far Eastern region, specifically the vicinity of Vladivostok, homeport of the Russian Pacific Fleet, in order to protect its expanding naval presence in the Asia-Pacific region from aerial threats."
