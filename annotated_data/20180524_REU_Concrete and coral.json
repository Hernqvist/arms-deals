  "text": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At first glance from above it looks like any clean and neatly planned small town, complete with sports grounds, neat roads and large civic buildings.\n\nBut the town is on Subi reef in the Spratlys archipelago of the hotly contested South China Sea and, regional security experts believe, could soon be home to China\u2019s first troops based in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.\n\nPrivate sector data analysis reviewed by Reuters shows Subi, some 1,200 km (750 miles) from China\u2019s coast, is now home to nearly 400 individual buildings \u2013 far more than other Chinese islands.\n\nSubi could be the future location of hundreds of People\u2019s Liberation Army marines, as well as a possible administrative hub as China cements its claim with a civilian presence, security analysts and diplomatic sources say.\n\nThe data from Earthrise Media, a non-profit group supporting independent media with imagery research, was based on surveys of high-resolution images obtained by DigitalGlobe satellites, dating back to when China started dredging reefs in early 2014.\n\nThe images show neat rows of basketball courts, parade grounds and a wide variety of buildings, some flanked by radar equipment.\n\nEarthrise founder Dan Hammer said his team\u2019s count included only free-standing, permanent and recognizable structures.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at these pictures I see a standard PLA base on the mainland \u2013 it is incredible, right down to the basketball courts,\u201d Singapore-based security analyst Collin Koh said after reviewing the data and images.\n\n\u201cAny deployment of troops will be a huge step, however \u2013 and then they will need to secure and sustain them, so the military presence will have to only grow from where it is now.\u201d\n\nSenior Western diplomats describe the placement of troops or jet fighters on the islands as a looming test of international efforts to curb China\u2019s determination to dominate the vital trade waterway.\n\nSubi is the largest of China\u2019s seven man-made outposts in the Spratlys. The so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d of Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs all share similar infrastructure \u2013 including emplacements for missiles, 3km runways, extensive storage facilities and a range of installations that can track satellites, foreign military activity and communications.\n\nMischief and Fiery Cross each house almost 190 individual buildings and structures, according to the Earthrise analysis. The previously unpublished data details the building count on more than 60 South China Sea features, including those occupied by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines.\n\nWhile the data shows well developed infrastructure on some on islands such as Vietnam's Spratly Island, the Philippines' Thitu Island and Taiwan's Itu Aba, the scale and development by Beijing dwarfs its rivals.

China blames Washington for militarizing the region with their freedom of navigation patrols.\n\nDing Duo, a researcher at the Chinese government-backed National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Beijing needs a military presence in the Spratlys to protect its civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs for how big that presence is depends on the threat assessment China has going forward for the Nansha Islands,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the Spratlys.\n\n\u201cThe Nansha region faces severe military pressure, especially since Trump took office and increased freedom of navigation patrols. So China has raised its threat assessment.\u201d\n\nLOOMING TEST\n\nThe White House said this month it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization after CNBC reported anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems had been installed on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross. [nL1N1SA1VE]\n\nThis weekend, China revealed bombers had conducted take-off and landing training on some of its islands and reefs in preparation for what it called \u201cthe battle for the South China Sea\u201d. [nL3N1SR08Q]\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nSome U.S. analysts noted PLA photographs appeared to show a bomber landing on Woody Island in the Paracels, and the Chinese military has yet to confirm planes actually landed on its Spratlys holdings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to join a major naval drill because of Beijing\u2019s continued militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. [nL2N1SU1KU]\n\nAdmiral Philip Davidson, the nominee to be the next commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific, said last month the bases were now complete and lacked only deployed forces.\n\n\u201cAny forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\u201d Davidson told a congressional panel.\n\nSo far, repeated U.S. naval patrols close to Chinese features and growing international naval deployments through the region have had little obvious impact on Beijing\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cThere is a real sense among Western nations that a new strategy is needed, but there is little sign anything meaningful coalescing,\u201d said one senior Western diplomat familiar with discussions across several countries. \u201cThe deployment of jet fighters \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will sorely test that lack of a cohesive response.\u201d\n\nAlready large Chinese amphibious landing vessels and other ships have used the full-scale naval wharves at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief \u2013 pointing to what foreign naval officers describe as virtually a permanent presence throughout hotly contested waters.\n\nChinese forces are using their island holdings to police of what Chinese naval officers tell other navies is a \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d \u2013 an ambiguous term that both Asian and Western military officials say holds no basis in international law.\n\nPeople briefed on recent Western intelligence reports describe an intensifying pattern of radio challenges to foreign military ships and aircraft delivered from Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on Fiery Cross.\n\nAustralian officials recently publicized a \u201crobust but polite\u201d Chinese challenge to three of its naval ships plying the South China Sea en route to Vietnam.\n\nSources say such exchanges between Chinese and foreign militaries are far more frequent than is widely known.\n\n\u201cThey have become the rule rather than the exception across significant areas of the South China Sea,\u201d one person familiar with recent Western security reports told Reuters.\n\nShips and aircraft from India, France, Japan, New Zealand and rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have also been similarly warned, according to regional military officials and analysts.\n\nWith the claimed \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d having no basis in international law or military practice, foreign naval officials routinely stress they are in international waters and continue on their way.\n\nZhang Baohui, a Chinese security expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, said Beijing was likely to be cautious about any offensive moves, such as the stationing of combat aircraft.\n\n\u201cNow the islands are complete, I think we will see a degree of caution in Beijing\u2019s next moves,\u201d he said. \u201cSustaining that presence so far from the Chinese coast is a massive undertaking, and I think the deployment of troops and jet fighters would really cross a threshold for China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials insist they are leaving little to chance, warning the bases are already helping China project military power into areas once dominated by its neighbors.\n\n\u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d Davidson said in his testimony last month."
