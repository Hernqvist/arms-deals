Canadian special forces and, potentially, other government departments will use them for missions overseas and in Canada.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser, or Canadian special forces will receive three new surveillance aircraft - aircraft expected 2022 Back to video\n\nThe agreement for the aircraft was finalized on April 26 with the U.S. government. Three aircraft and equipment will be delivered in the spring of 2022, the Canadian Forces noted.\n\nThe federal government is also setting up a competitive process to select a company to maintain the aircraft and related systems for a potential period of 20 years. A Request for Proposals is expected sometime this summer.\n\nThe agreement signed with the U.S. government is for $188 million (CAN)."
