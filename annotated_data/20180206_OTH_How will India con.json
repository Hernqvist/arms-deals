  "text": "Author: Chitrapu Uday Bhaskar, New Delhi\n\nChina and India have a complex and prickly relationship: a consequence of geography, history and recent experiences between the two.\n\nAn unresolved territorial and border dispute led to a brief war between the two countries in October 1962, and the humiliation of India in that confrontation remains part of its collective national memory. This reality shapes India\u2019s response to China\u2019s increasing influence and power in the region today.\n\nWhen it comes to assessing national power, the differing trajectories of Chinese and Indian GDP since 1960 and the current disparity between them is quite stark. In 1960, China\u2019s GDP was half that of India\u2019s. In 2017, China\u2019s nominal GDP is estimated to be US$11.8 trillion, while India\u2019s is closer to US$2.45 trillion. China has successfully \u2018risen\u2019 and some expect it to displace the United States as \u2018number one\u2019 within a decade.\n\nDespite this, democratic India remains the intangible challenge in Asia for Beijing.\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts at enabling the birth of Bangladesh in December 1971 stoked a deep anxiety in China, and Beijing came to the conclusion that India had to be contained within the subcontinent and kept in a state of extended disequilibrium.\n\nThis geopolitical template provides the context for the strategic partnership that China has maintained with Pakistan since the early 1970s. Beijing has used its comprehensive economic and military capability to enhance its footprint in India\u2019s neighbourhood, including in Bangladesh, and most recently the Maldives. Most of these states have become heavily dependent on China rather than India for their economic and military needs \u2014 partly because of the difference in the two countries\u2019 military and economic power.\n\nBangladesh illustrates how growing Chinese power has shrunk India\u2019s profile. Over the past decade China has displaced India as Bangladesh\u2019s largest trading partner \u2014 in 2015, imports from China (including Hong Kong) were 27 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s total imports, while India held closer to 12 per cent. The Bangladeshi military is also importing material from China (including submarines). So two of India\u2019s closest neighbours \u2014 Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 are becoming more dependent on Beijing, compounding India\u2019s security dilemma.\n\nBut China\u2019s strengthening military relationships in the region and an unresolved India and China on the Doklam plateau from June to August 2017 are only part of India\u2019s security challenge.\n\nChina\u2019s investment in the aims to help it overcome the \u2018Malacca dilemma\u2019 in which most of its energy supply needs must pass through the Straits of Malacca. The Chinese investment in ports along the Indian Ocean littoral has often been described as a string of pearls, and both Gwadar in Pakistan and the Chinese military station in Djibouti indicate a near-permanent Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSo how has this spread of Chinese power affected India?\n\nThe Indian response to the spectrum of challenges presented by Chinese power is multipronged. Doklam is a reflection of the current Indian resolve to act unilaterally and remain firm, even if China adopts an intimidating posture.\n\nAt the bilateral and multilateral levels, India\u2019s Modi government is exploring new partnerships, particularly in the maritime domain. Good order at sea and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific is now packaged as a collective security objective, and China is being encouraged to come on board. India\u2019s bilateral partnerships with the United States and have acquired a visible naval and maritime sheen, and the possibility of this evolving into a with Australia as a partner has been endorsed by President Trump on his recent trip to Asia.\n\nIf this acquires greater military and policy credibility, then a \u2018diamond necklace\u2019 could emerge \u2014 stoking the Malacca dilemma in an unambiguous way.\n\nMuch will depend on the domestic politics in the four democracies \u2014 India, Australia, Japan and the United States \u2014 and the degree to which their corporate and security elites harmonise their views about how to manage China.\n\nBut the exigency to constrain China by suasion will not unfold in a linear manner, nor is it set in stone. The US\u2013China relationship is more opaque and deeply intertwined than it publicly appears. Trump\u2019s five-nation tour through Asia in November 2017 and its outcome will offer valuable cues about how Beijing under a more confident Xi will use its power and the degree to which can accommodate it.\n\nWhether China becomes more revisionist or is willing to maintain an evolving status quo in global affairs will have significant regional implications that will shape India\u2019s response in the longer term.\n\nChitrapu Uday Bhaskar is a retired Indian Navy Commodore and Director of the Society for Policy Studies, New Delhi.\n\nThis article appeared in the most recent edition of East Asia Forum Quarterly, \u2018China\u2019s influence\u2019."
