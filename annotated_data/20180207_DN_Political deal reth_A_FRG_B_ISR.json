  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 German government negotiators have approved a new defense and security direction for the country, coupling boosts in military expenditures with equal increases in foreign assistance.\n\nMonths of haggling over a new government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel culminated Wednesday as leaders of her center-right Christian Democratic Union, its sister party Christian Social Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, or SPD, unveiled a written coalition agreement in Berlin.\n\nInsiders say the topic of defense spending ended up being relatively uncontroversial during closed-door talks, and party negotiators agreed on language that would keep Germany in line with a pledge by NATO members to annually allocate 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024.\n\n\n\nMembers of the SPD had decried that goal as unrealistic and unnecessary during last year\u2019s election season.\n\nIn what could be a nod to critics of a rigid spending goal, the coalition agreement stresses that increases in the traditional military budget would come with plus-ups in fields that also have the potential to solve or prevent global crises. Those could include delivering humanitarian aid or funding educational projects abroad.\n\nArmed drones for Germany? Merkel\u2019s would-be government sizes up defense priorities Here\u2019s a rundown of key national security topics that are up for grabs in a likely coalition of three German political parties.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin on Feb. 7, Merkel hailed the idea of a \u201cnetted security\u201d approach, in which nonmilitary instruments of power would gain greater prominence.\n\nAs a major host of refugees from war-stricken Syria and impoverished North Africa, Germany\u2019s security calculus includes removing the impetus for refugees having to stream into Europe in the first place.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

The SPD blocked plans for a weapons-capable version of the aircraft last summer.\n\nAn Israeli Heron TP surveillance drone flies during a presentation to the media at the Tel Nof Air Force Base, south of Tel Aviv, on Feb. 21, 2010.

Policies requiring EU-wide program competitions could be waived to achieve greater speed for urgently needed equipment. That also would apply for projects involving technologies deemed key for the domestic industrial base.\n\nIn addition, there are plans for a new agency devoted to developing \u201cdisruptive\u201d cybersecurity and sensitive technologies, the document states.\n\nOverall, the defense section of the coalition agreement strives to strike a balance between Germany\u2019s alliance with Washington and its place as a key player in Europe. While it pledges that Berlin would \u201cbreathe life\u201d into a common EU defense policy, it notes that the Unites States is undergoing \u201cfar-reaching change\u201d that would present great challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will react to this with offers for dialogue and cooperation,\u201d negotiators wrote, adding that members of the new government would seek additional avenues for working with the Trump administration, Congress and state governments."
