  "text": "The new chief for research in the Pentagon is building an artificial intelligence center, pushing for self-driving vehicles in combat zones and more powerful lasers, and says solving the hypersonic gap means updating testing facilities.\n\nDefense Undersecretary for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin testified before the House Armed Services Committee last week, answering questions on a range of gear and procurement questions.\n\nBut those most relevant to service members included weapons systems on the horizon that troops could see in combat with near peer adversaries.\n\nThese two Army BCTs will be the first to put robotic vehicles in their formations The autonomous ground vehicle is meant to be capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds of gear over 60 miles in 72 hours.\n\nMore rapid development will include the use of unmanned ground vehicles in formations.\n\nThe Army recently announced the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne Division will have a robotic combat vehicle called the Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport in the ranks this year for testing, which will develop the likely full-fielding gear mule-type robot.\n\nSimple tasks, such as delivering food, mail, water and fuel, could be automated sooner than some think, Griffin said.\n\n\u201cI think, frankly, we\u2019re going to have self-driving vehicles in theater for the Army before we\u2019ll have self-driving cars on the streets,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIf that can be done by an automated unmanned vehicle with a relatively simple AI driving algorithm where I don\u2019t have to worry about pedestrians and road signs and all of that, why wouldn\u2019t I do that?\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Transitioning out of the service?

But it won\u2019t happen tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe need to have 100-kilowatt-class weapons on Army theater vehicles. We need to have 300-kilowatt-class weapons on Air Force tankers,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe need to have megawatt-class directed energy weapons in space for space defense. These are things we can do over the next decade if we can maintain our focus.\u201d\n\nScientists he\u2019s been talking with have told him that level of laser power is five to six years away and a \u201cmegawatt laser\u201d is within a decade with persistent investment.\n\n\u2018An unacceptable situation\u2019\n\n\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., pointed out that the testing facilities, such as White Sands Missile Range in his state, have scarcely seen any upgrades or improvements in the past two decades, despite leaps in technology for missiles, lasers and other items.\n\nGriffin agreed, saying at a low estimate at least 20 such testing facilities across the nation are in the same situation.\n\nHe said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency does most of the leading-edge work on hypersonic missile systems and they have exactly one testing facility, a NASA wind tunnel near Langley, Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis is an unacceptable situation,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nHe promised to return with budget requests to renovate those facilities to improve testing.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., asked about a new area of focus that has broad-reaching effects: artificial intelligence.\n\nGriffin oversees the creation of a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that would create AI solutions for all the service branches.\n\nHe deferred on the details but told members that he expected to return with a plan within two months.\n\n\u201cWe owe the Congress a report, I think, about two months from now on what our A.I. strategy will be. And the JAIC, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, will be a part of that overall strategy,\u201d Griffin said."
