  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. State Department has approved a $270.4 million sale to the United Arab Emirates that includes more than 300 Sidewinder missiles, and a $197 million upgrade of Qatar\u2019s air operations center. Raytheon will be the prime contractor for each.\n\nThe proposed sale to Qatar, which Congress must approve, comes amid a standoff between Doha and a Saudi-led, four-nation alliance. Qatar is home to Al Udeid Air Base, which houses 10,000 U.S. personnel and serves as a crucial overseas American base.\n\nThe State Department announced Thursday it had notified Congress of the two sales. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in June, accusing the tiny but super-rich Gulf state of supporting militant groups and cozying up to Shiite, non-Arab Iran \u2014 charges Doha denies.\n\nThe State Department announcement called Qatar, \u201ca friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., announced in February he would lift his eight-month hold on U.S. arms sales to Gulf Cooperation Council member states, which he levied to pressure a resolution with Qatar. At the time, he lamented the crisis between the Saudi-led bloc and Qatar was no closer to a resolution.\n\nAccording to the State department announcement, the U.S. upgrade of the Qatar Emiri Air Force\u2019s air operations center would include:\n\nOne multifunctional information distribution system low-volume terminal.\n\nGPS selective availability anti-spoofing module chips.\n\n\n\nSimple key loaders.\n\n\n\nHigh-assurance internet protocol encryptors.\n\n\n\nGround-support system components for Link 16.\n\nInfrastructure construction, integration, installation and sustainment services.\n\nCybersecurity services.\n\n\n\nTechnical and support facilities.\n\n\n\nCommunications security support.\n\n\n\nThe prime contractor, Raytheon, of Waltham, Massachusetts, is expected to assign 15 contractor representatives to Qatar, beside five government representatives.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
