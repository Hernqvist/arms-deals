  "text": "The United States has handed over a donated C-130E Hercules transport aircraft to Ethiopia.\n\nUS Ambassador Michael Raynor delivered the aircraft on behalf of the United States Government to Ethiopian Air Force Head, General Adem Mohammed on 6 June.\n\nThe US embassy in Addis Ababa said the C-130 will further enhance Ethiopia\u2019s capacity to play a vital role in regional peacekeeping missions, enabling Ethiopia to move humanitarian supplies where they are needed in a timely manner and protect the lives of civilians in conflict areas.\n\n\u201cOur part in supporting Ethiopia in this vital role is relatively humble, but we\u2019re proud that the training, logistical support, and equipment we provide helps Ethiopia take on this important task,\u201d Raynor said.\n\n\u201cThis aircraft represents a deep bond between our two countries, and our shared pledge to play constructive leadership roles on the world stage,\u201d said Raynor. \u201cThe U.S. commitment to this partnership is stronger than ever, and I look forward to building upon it in the days ahead.\u201d\n\nBrigadier General Deiter Bareihs of the US Air Forces Europe and Africa also took part in the ceremony along with other representatives from the U.S. armed forces. He said, \u201cWe are excited to deliver this C-130 at a time of such great optimism. This handover pays homage to our long-valued friendship and lays the foundation for new possibilities for cooperation and interoperability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States values Ethiopia\u2019s role in peacekeeping operations and ongoing commitment as the largest contributor to UN Peacekeeping forces in the world,\u201d the US embassy said.\n\nIt appears the handover is for a C-130E that was originally donated in 2014 and subsequently refurbished. Earlier reports suggested it may be a second C-130 but this now seems unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Air Force\u2019s 15 Squadron has flown C-130s since 1998 when it received two former US Air Force C-130Bs and later two commercial L100-30 variants that were previously operated by the Ethiopian Government. It is not clear if the aircraft are still operational.\n\n* This article was upated to reflect the fact that the handover is likely for the C-130E that was donated in 2014."
