  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Franco-German plans for a joint fighter aircraft project may be off to a rocky start, as reports emerged last week about fundamental disagreements between the two partners over export restrictions for such a weapon.\n\nAccording to a report on the website of the German magazine Der Spiegel, French negotiators made unlimited exportability of the so-called Future Combat Air System a prerequisite for getting started on the project.\n\nThe position is at odds with a more restrictive policy by Berlin, where arms deals to sensitive countries traditionally are more heavily scrutinized for the potential of human rights abuses by the recipient government.\n\nThe Spiegel based its report on a four-page confidential cable from Germany\u2019s ambassador in Paris, Nikolaus Meyer-Landrut, describing the outcome of a Sept. 21 \u201ccrisis meeting\u201d in the French capital.\n\nSo deep ran the diverging views at the gathering that Claire Landais, the French secretary-general for defense and national security, threatened to cancel further planning unless Germany would agree to French demands for unconstrained exports of the future combat aircraft, according to the Spiegel.\n\nAirbus CEO Tom Enders, whose company is involved in the planning alongside Dassault Aviation, criticized the reported German insistence on export caveats. \u201cBerlin can\u2019t urge greater European cooperation in its Sunday speeches and then refuse it when concrete projects are taking shape,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\n\u2018We are not dupes\u2019: France takes step away from US with fighter program France needs to gradually cut its reliance on certain American components, according to the French armed forces minister, though she admits it's impossible to be completely independent.\n\nThe idea behind the Future Combat Air System program is to create a sixth-generation aircraft that would eventually help wean European air forces from American-made hardware. A development contract is eyed for the mid-2020s following years of concept studies.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Supporting systems are eyed to include unmanned aircraft of various types plus a data link architecture connecting all elements.\n\nGerman arms exports outside NATO and European Union countries have come under renewed fire since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by regime agents in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Saudi government initially denied knowing about the crime but was forced to acknowledge Khashoggi\u2019s death following weeks of international pressure."
