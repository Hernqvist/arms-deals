  "text": "NATIONAL HARBOR \u2014 The Romanian Navy is exploring the purchase of a new drone for its expansion and modernization plans, the chief of the Romanian Naval Forces said Monday.\n\nAmid growing tensions with Russia on the Black Sea, the service is looking at a \u201ctotally new\u201d unmanned aerial system for the maritime and riverine domain, Vice Adm. Alexandru Mirsu said at the Sea-Air-Space forum here.\n\nThe capability would be used by Romania's Danube flotilla and for coastal surveillance, operated from the shoreline, Mirsu said. He did not provide a timeframe or a budget for the possible acquisition.\n\nPlans are underway to buy four new multipurpose corvettes as the core of the Romanian navy, and to modernize its Type 22 frigates. Also expected are purchases of new coastal missile batteries and three new submarines \u2014 all part of Romania\u2019s commitment to spending 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense for the next decade.\n\nThe idea is to expand Romania\u2019s presence in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and elswhere as needed by allies, and to maintain a submarine program beyond 2030.\n\nMirsu has previously said the submarines are needed to ensure Romania\u2019s operational capacities in the Black Sea, as the one Kilo-class submarine does not meet that need. Its Delfinul submarine was reportedly withdrawn from service and was being used for training purposes.\n\nMirsu also pointed to \u201ca new iron curtain\u201d of Russian anti access/area denial (A2/AD) hubs in Kaliningrad, Sevastopol and Syria.\n\nHe lauded major multinational exercises and NATO operations on the Black Sea for sending a message that the Black Sea is open, and an international body of water.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
