The donation was made by China\u2019s Ministry of National Defence.\n\nChinese Ambassador Xue Bing said the donation was part of an ongoing relationship between China and PNG, which has also seen 83 officers from the defence force train in China.\n\nHe said such exchanges and cooperation have deepened the mutual understanding of the two armed forces and brought real benefits for the people.\n\n\u201cIt fully demonstrates our sincere support to the PNG Defence Force for its capacity building,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is also another illustration of the practical results and benefits brought to us in the 41 years of friendly relations between China and PNG.\n\n\u201cI hope that this batch of equipment will be helpful for the PNGDF to enhance the ability to safeguard the national interest and to maintain peace and safety of your country and people.\u201d\n\nSaid Defence Minister Solan Mirisim: \u201cIt\u2019s the second gift by the People\u2019s Republic of China in the short time since the relationship started in 2007, compared to that relationship with other countries.\n\n\u201cThat growth in our relationship is featured and illustrated by the many exchange visits by the senior military officers of the PNGDF, and China is ranked second to those of other countries.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to use these equipment . . . for the Apec programme in 2018.\u201d\n\nPNGDF Commander Brigadier-General Gilbert Toropo said the Chinese government was also helping with medical and gymnasium equipment.\n\nHe said China donated 44 vehicles last year.\n\n\u201cThis donation will assist our troops to be mobile and conduct operations during Apec 2018,\u201d he said."
