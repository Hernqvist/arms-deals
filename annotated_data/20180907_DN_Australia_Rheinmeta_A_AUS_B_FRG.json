Deliveries for the new order will begin next year and last until 2024, the German company said.\n\nThe latest batch of vehicles stems from the Australian LAND 121 Phase 5B program, which is an extension of the larger 3B segment.\n\n\u201cThis follow-up order is of great strategic significance to us, providing an excellent reference for other important international projects,\u201d Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger was quoted as saying in the company statement.\n\n\u201cIt reflects Australia\u2019s satisfaction with our performance and the quality of our vehicles,\u201d he added. \u201cRheinmetall\u2019s latest success in the Asia-Pacific region proves that our products are at the cutting edge of technology, and that the customer see in us a proven and reliable partner, fully capable of carrying out sophisticated large-scale projects.\u201d\n\nRheinmetall wins $3 billion Australian armored vehicle competition A total of 211 vehicles will be acquired under the Australian Defence Force\u2019s Project Land 400 Phase 2, valued at an estimated AU$5 billion (U.S. $3.3 billion). The first vehicle will be delivered in 2020.\n\nThe D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany-based company currently is Australia's largest supplier of military vehicles, according to the website of the state of Queensland. Rheinmetall is establishing a \u201cmilitary vehicle center of excellence\u201d outside of Brisbane, the state's capital.\n\nThat location is slated to be a hub for the Australian military\u2019s LAND 400 program, for which Rheinmetall was formally tapped last month to build Boxer wheeled armored reconnaissance vehicles worth \u20ac2.1 billion. The award was first announced by the Australian government in March.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
