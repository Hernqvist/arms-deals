  "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 More than two decades after the program was officially launched, Turkey has signed a contract for the serial production of the country\u2019s first indigenous, new-generation main battle tank, the Altay.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar contract was signed Nov. 9 between Turkey\u2019s defense procurement authority, the Defence Industry Executive of the Presidency (or SSB, formerly SSM) and Turkish-Qatari armored vehicles manufacturer BMC, which has close links to Turkey\u2019s ruling party. Officials did not reveal the contract price.\n\nThe contract involves the production of an initial batch of 250 units, life cycle logistical support, and the establishment by the contractor of a tank systems technology center and its operation. As part of the contract, BMC will also design, develop and produce a tank with an unmanned fire control unit.\n\nThe first Altay tank will roll off the assembly line within 18 months, according to the contract.\n\nAccording to Ahmet Raci Yal\u00e7\u0131n, head of the land vehicles department at SSB, the Altay program will materialize in two phases: T1 and T2. T1 covers the first 250 units, he said, and the T2 phase will involve the advanced version of the Altay.\n\nIsmail Demir, the head of SSB, said: \u201cThis contract is the joint work of the parties (SSB and BMC) for the optimal production of a cost-efficient tank.\u201d He added that the Turkish government has not ruled out partnerships, cooperation and support with and from foreign entities.\n\nAfter Turkey\u2019s election, is it (defense) business as usual? Turkey's president is widely known for his ambitions in indigenous defense and aerospace capabilities in line with his efforts to increase Turkey\u2019s regional and global political clout.\n\nHe also noted that the government expects BMC to deliver unmanned armored vehicles solutions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nDespite plans for the Altay to be the \u201cbest tank in the world\u201d (in the words of BMC Chairman Ethem Sancak), industry sources and experts are questioning the program\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cNo one knows if, as originally planned, the Altay would be powered by a German-made engine (from MTU) and a German-made transmission mechanism,\u201d one source said. \u201cThere are big questions marks about the armor and the active protection system. \u2026 And of course, if the Altay will feature German know-how, will it be on the market with German export licenses, or restricted for sales abroad, or even deployed for certain sensitive missions like in Syria or Iraq?\u201d\n\nDemir, however, is confident Turkey \u201cwill not allow any restrictions\u201d in regard to indigenous programs with foreign know-how, including the engine. In other words: BMC will use foreign engines in the first Altay tanks due to \u201ctime limitations,\u201d but ultimately Turkey wants to maximize locally made parts for its indigenous programs.\n\nIn terms of where this foreign technology will come from, A London-based defense expert noted that a potential German blockade could mean \u201cBMC will not have too many options and may have to go non-NATO, like Russia or Ukraine.\u201d Such a move would be the second major defense contract that Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 would sign with a non-NATO country, after the government\u2019s decision to acquire and deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense system.\n\nSecurity experts say Turkey\u2019s regional rivals, as well as state and nonstate entities Turkey views as security threats, are closely watching the Altay\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cThe future pace of the Altay program and potential technological and financial snags it may face will be watched closely by Greece, Syria, Iraq and, to a lesser degree, by Russia,\u201d said Ahmet Do\u011fan, vice president of the Ankara-based think tank Sigma.\n\nCurrency crisis risks Turkish defense programs Turkey\u2019s defense and procurement planners are worried the plunge of the national currency could expose foreign currency-related weapons programs to the risk of major delays or suspension.\n\nIn April, the procurement authority SSB, then SSM, announced that it selected BMC as the winner of the Altay contract. BMC defeated Otokar, an armored vehicles producer that built the Altay\u2019s prototype, and FNSS, another privately owned armored vehicles maker.\n\nIn 2008, Otokar, Turkey\u2019s largest privately owned defense company, signed a $500 million contract with SSM for the development and production of four prototypes of the Altay. The prototype contract did not involve serial production.\n\nBMC is a partnership between a Qatari investment fund and a Turkish venture, whose partner, Sancak, also sat on the executive board of Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party."
