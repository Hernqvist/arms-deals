The most important thing is to avoid disparities in other sectors due to the transition to mutual settlements in national currencies,\u201d the service\u2019s chief Dmitry Shugayev told NTV.\n\nAlso on rt.com US using false accusations on trade to 'intimidate' countries \u2013 China\n\nHe added: \u201cHowever, the sanctions have another negative aspect, namely to intimidate our partners quite unceremoniously.\u201d\n\nShugayev told TASS earlier that he did not see any threat from Washington\u2019s punitive measures against contracts with China for the supply of Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defense systems.\n\nS-400 is a long-range air defense system designed to protect strategically important sites. It is capable of destroying multiple aerial targets at an extremely long range of up to 400 kilometers (nearly 250 miles).\n\nIn September, the United States imposed sanctions on China due to the country\u2019s purchase of 10 Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets along with S-400s from Russia.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia phasing out US dollar in military contracts in favor of local currencies \u2013 trade minister\n\nFollowing the introduction of US sanctions, Russian Trade Minister Denis Manturov said that Moscow was dropping the greenback in major arms deals and switching to the Russian ruble and the national currencies of its partners.\n\nAt the moment, China\u2019s stock of orders for Russian military products exceeds $7 billion.\n\nFor more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section"
