  "text": "Japan and the UK are moving forward with efforts to develop a new joint air-to-air missile.\n\nThe project is understood to be supported by a successfully conducted project to integrate Japanese seeker technologies into MBDA\u2019s Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile, IHS Jane\u2019s has reported.\n\nThe project utilises Japanese technologies to enhance the accuracy and performance of the missile.\n\nMeteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile being developed by MBDA. Meteor will offer a multi-shot capability against long range manoeuvring targets in a heavy electronic countermeasures environment with range in excess of 100km.\n\nMBDA is planning integration of Meteor on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Block 4. The Meteor has already been checked for fit in the internal weapons bays of the JSF. It is compatible with the aircraft\u2019s internal air-to-ground stations, but would require modification of the fin span and air intakes to be compatible with the air-to-air stations.\n\nIt is understood that it is in this context, MBDA has agreed to jointly research a new seeker with Japan.\n\nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon said:\n\n\u201cJapan is our closest security partner in Asia and I want to significantly deepen defence cooperation between our two nations.\n\nWe will do that through joint exercises, reciprocal access to our military bases, military personnel exchanges and cooperation on equipment, including a new air-to-air missile.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success of the first round of talks on the Co-operative Research Project on the Feasibility of a Joint New Air-to-Air Missile (JNAAM), the Ministers have confirmed discussions would move to the second stage.\n\nFurther additional cooperation could, according to a MoD press release, include mine hunting in the Gulf; cooperating to improve amphibious capability; and improving counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) capability. The UK also welcomed increasing Japanese participation in NATO exchanges and joint exercises."
