  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials are planning to increase military spending for fiscal 2020 by using temporary war funding accounts to get around federal budget caps, a controversial move that could undermine negotiations with lawmakers.\n\nIn an essay for Real Clear Politics on Monday, acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought wrote that the move is needed because \u201cDemocrats insist on demanding more social spending in exchange for continuing to fund defense spending,\u201d while President Donald Trump has called for cuts.\n\n\u201cExpanding the use of (overseas contingency) funds remains the administration\u2019s only fiscally responsible option in meeting national security needs while avoiding yet another increase to the spending caps,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe acknowledged that the move is likely to make fiscal conservatives \u201cuncomfortable\u201d but called it necessary given political opposition to Trump\u2019s past fiscal plans.\n\nTrump changes his mind again on military spending, now wants a big boost next year The president is expected this week to announce plans for $750 billion in fiscal 2020 military spending, a huge jump from previous targets.\n\nThe move comes as several lawmakers and budget analysts have pushed for reductions in the temporary war funding accounts, designed to cover only the ongoing operations overseas.\n\nCritics say that because the accounts aren\u2019t affected by congressionally mandated spending caps, they have become a hiding place for a host of desired program resets and expansions by the Pentagon.\n\nThe size of the war accounts has shrunk in recent years, from more than $100 billion in fiscal 2017 to less than $69 billion this fiscal year. Vought did not specify how large the president\u2019s request for fiscal 2020 will be, but Politico reported the fund could top $174 billion.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

The president and conservative defense lawmakers have argued the money is needed to rebuild military might after more than 17 years of war.\n\nBut congressional Democrats have already panned the military proposal as too high and said that adequate appropriations for the Departments of State and Homeland Security are as critical to national security as Pentagon spending. They have promised to make funding parity a key point of upcoming budget negotiations.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., blasted the war funding reports as \u201ca gimmick to prop up defense spending\u201d by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a blatant attempt to make a mockery of the federal budget process, obscure the true cost of military operations, and severely shortchange other investments vital to our national and economic security,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nIn the last two fiscal years, lawmakers reached a compromise on defense and non-defense spending levels to avoid spending caps put in place in 2011. But those caps return again next fiscal year and limit defense spending to $576 billion and nondefense spending to $542 billion.\n\nVought said raising the cap for defense spending is necessary but lifting it for the other programs \u201cwould be a bad deal for taxpayers.\u201d He called the national debt a looming crisis for the country.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Congress to join the president in his commitment to cutting spending, reducing bloated deficits, and getting our national debt under control,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s future generations are depending on them.\u201d"
