Photo supplied\n\nNational Assembly passes $6 billion 2018 budget\n\nThe National Assembly, with only ruling party lawmakers in attendance, voted on Friday to pass the national budget for 2018 and to add two additional positions to 10 parliamentary committees, a day after a Supreme Court ruling dissolved the only other party to hold seats in the assembly.\n\nThe Cambodia National Rescue Party ceased to exist on Thursday after the Supreme Court used widely condemned amendments to the Law on Political Parties to dissolve it for its purported attempt to overthrow the government.\n\nThe $6 billion national budget will see the education, health and defence ministries receive substantial increases, and was passed by 65 Cambodian People\u2019s Party lawmakers, including Prime Minister Hun Sen. The ruling party holds 68 seats to the now-dissolved CNRP\u2019s 55.\n\n\u201cWe had already passed the draft budget law with 65 voices on Friday, and the document explains what sectors are a priority, including education, health, the elections and social sectors,\u201d said National Assembly spokesman Leng Peng Long.\n\nPeng Long added that the assembly\u2019s 10 parliamentary committees will now each have two additional members, taking membership up to 11.\n\n\u201cBefore there were nine people, and sometimes one party did not come, another party did not have enough members to hold the meeting. [Now] even if there are absentees, we can continue the meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder recently passed amendments to the Law on the Election of Members of the National Assembly, the CNRP\u2019s parliamentary seats will now be redistributed among six small parties \u2013 mostly to the royalist Funcinpec party, which pushed to have the CNRP dissolved."
