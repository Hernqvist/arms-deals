  "text": "The Angolan Air Force is operating a Cessna Citation jet configured by Israel\u2019s BIRD Aerosystems for the maritime surveillance role.\n\nIHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly reports that the Citation has been fitted with Leonardo\u2019s SeaSpray active electronically scanned array (AESA) multimode surveillance radar and a Controp electro-optical (EO) sensor in a belly fairing. The aircraft also has an automatic identification system (AIS) receiver and satellite communications systems.\n\nBIRD Aerosystems told IHS Jane\u2019s that the $20 million Airborne Surveillance, Information, and Observation (ASIO) contract includes the maritime surveillance aircraft, ground-based command and control centre and ASIO workstations on naval vessels. More aircraft will be delivered at a later date.\n\n\u201cThe client wants to be able to identify motherships that remain outside of the waters and the smaller associated satellite fishing vessels that enter its waters,\u201d Shaul Mazor, vice-president of marketing and business development at BIRD, told IHS Jane\u2019s.\n\nBIRD Aerosystems in February 2015 announced a contract from an undisclosed customer for maritime surveillance aircraft \u201cinstalled with multiple sensors and multiple sub-systems\u201d.\n\nThe Citation (N54FT) was exported from the United States to Angola at the beginning of the year and cancelled from the US register on 19 January 2017. Its previous owner was listed by the Federal Aviation Administration as \u201cBank of Utah Trustee\u201d. The aircraft was then seen at Megiddo Airfield in Israel in January and was flying in Angola by August. The aircraft was built in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBird Aerosystems was established in 2001 in Israel. It specialises in airborne missile protection systems and airborne surveillance, information and observation solutions for maritime and ground surveillance."
