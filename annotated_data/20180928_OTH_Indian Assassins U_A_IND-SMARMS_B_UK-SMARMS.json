The operation\u2019s goal was to capture Bhindranwale. It escalated. Bhindranwale and many Sikhs were killed.\n\nThis caused widespread outrage among India\u2019s Sikh community. Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, both members of the Indian Intelligence Bureau\u2019s special task force for the protection of the prime minister, plotted revenge. They were armed with a 1A machine carbine and a .38-caliber revolver.\n\nGandhi was shot as she walked through the garden of her residence in New Delhi en route to a television interview with Peter Ustinov. As she approached a gate guarded by the two bodyguards, Beant Singh stepped forward and fired three rounds from his .38, hitting Gandhi in the abdomen. Satwant Singh then emptied his 1A\u2019s entire 30-round magazine into the prime minister.\n\nAt top \u2014 a 1A submachine gun. Above \u2014 Indira Gandhi. Photos via the author\n\nThe 1A is an Indian copy of the British L2A3/Mk4 Sterling submachine gun. Sterling agreed a production license with India in the early 1960s, signing a contract worth \u00a316,000 to produce the first 60,000 guns and provide the technical drawings and tooling for India to manufacture the weapons. Over the last 50 years India\u2019 small arms factories have produced around a million 1A machine carbines \u2014 many more than even Sterling produced.\n\nThe prime minister reportedly died almost instantly, although other sources suggest she died later in hospital. Her assassins threw down their guns and were arrested. They were taken to a guardroom, where in an ensuing struggle for one of their captor\u2019s weapons, Beant Singh was killed by a burst of fire from another Indian-made Sterling.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination India was swept by a wave of anti-Sikh riots. Thousands died. Satwant Singh was sentenced to death and hanged in January 1989. Operation Blue Star and the assassination remain deeply decisive events.\n\nThis story originally appeared at Historical Firearms."
