Being the largest weapons importer in the world, the event \u2013 innovatively named DefExpo India \u2013 generates significant interest from around the world.\n\nFrom tank manufacturers in Russia to shipyards in Korea, assault rifle developers in Eastern Europe to global defence giants from the US and Europe, DefExpo is the place to be for meeting government officials, networking with Indian companies, and pitching the latest in destruction to the Indian armed forces.\n\nTraditionally held in the national capital, where it is easiest for government officials to attend, the event was moved to Goa in 2016, when Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister. This time around, the event has found its way to Kanchipuram district in Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s home state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nWhile the district is famous around the world for its silk saris, the Kanchipuram edition in April might not fetch the global interest that similar shows in the past have seen. In fact, several defence manufacturers and industry groups are predicting it to be a dud \u2013 not least due to the last-minute change of the venue from Goa to Tamil Nadu and a change of dates, which has thrown advance planning out of gear.\n\nLogistics\n\nThe mystery over the change of dates \u2013 the event is usually held in February-March \u2013 has remained unresolved. In December, it was \u2018confirmed\u2019 to global companies that the event would be held in Goa in February, prompting most to make travel and accommodation arrangements. Bookings were even made for stalls and exhibition space.\n\nHowever, on 18 January, Sitharaman announced a change of venue during an event in Chennai \u2013 to a temple complex in Kanchipuram district, south of Chennai on the East Coast Road. The logistics required to set up a venue from scratch at a completely new place are daunting to say the least.\n\nLow interest\n\nThe defence ministry, in a series of press releases, has claimed a \u2018tremendous response\u2019 to the event, saying the interest has been \u2018overwhelming\u2019 from both foreign countries and domestic defence industries.\n\n\u201cForty-two countries have already confirmed their participation and the number is expected to grow in the coming days. The countries who have confirmed participation include major defence manufacturing nations like USA, UK, Russia, France, Israel, Korea, Sweden, among others,\u201d an official release said.\n\nHowever, independent chats with global and Indian companies reveal that either delegations are being pruned or exhibition spaces will be shrunk this year. The official government website that tracks companies registered for the show also records just 325 companies confirmed for the show. Russia and France are currently the top participants with 19 companies each set to feature.\n\nThis, however, will be a far cry from the 2016 edition, where according to an official defence ministry release, over 1,000 companies participated, 490 of them from abroad. The release also says that 204 official delegations from overseas attended the show, making it India\u2019s largest ever defence expo.\n\nBusiness is bad\n\nA reason for the low interest from Indian companies this time is simple \u2014 business is bad. No large orders are in the pipeline for the private sector, discouraging a large set of small and medium enterprises that had set up shop at the 2016 show, hoping to ride the wave of a boom in the defence manufacturing sector.\n\nHowever as the past two years have shown, private companies have not been able to cash in on the sector. The recent report by junior defence minister Subhash Bhamre to the PMO has stated this problem in clear terms, blaming a lack of decision-making and bureaucratic processes for a failure to unlock Make in India in the sector.\n\nThe lacklustre defence budget \u2013 ThePrint brought out how the Air Force\u2019s allocation does not even make up for committed liabilities \u2013 has added to the disappointment.\n\nOther than the Rafale deal, it is a fact that not a single major defence contract that was initiated by the NDA government after it came to power in 2014 has actually been awarded to the winner. Deals that have been signed were either legacy \u2013 like the Chinook and Apache helicopter purchases \u2013 or have been handed over as nominations to the public sector.\n\nPSUs\u2019 plans\n\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that the DefExpo this time seems to be heading for a bailout from public sector units, the biggest beneficiary of the defence ministry\u2019s generosity over the past four years.\n\nThe theme for the expo this time is \u2018India: The Emerging Defence Manufacturing Hub\u2019. The mega plans for the event is to showcase weapon systems largely made by PSUs or developed by the DRDO.\n\nFrom Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd\u2019s flying platforms like the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Advanced Light Helicopter to the 155 mm Advanced Towed Artillery Gun (ATAG) and Arjun Tank, the show would see a range of Indian-made systems on display. In addition, naval shipyards will exhibit capabilities in manufacturing and servicing ships.\n\nWhile intense efforts are on to \u2018encourage\u2019 participation at the event in all manners possible, signs are certainly pointing at the DefExpo being a dud. A final verdict would be available in a fortnight or so, when final registrations for the event close down.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"
