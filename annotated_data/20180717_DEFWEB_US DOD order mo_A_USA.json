On 30 March 2017, Critical Solutions International was awarded a $131 946 942 firm-fixed-price, foreign military sales contract for the production of commercial Husky second generation systems as well as spares, equipment and training.\n\nThe vehicles are destined for Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and will be delivered by 30 March 2021. DCD said over 20 vehicles are involved in the contract.\n\nOther contracts have since followed \u2013 on 22 March this year Critical Solutions International was awarded a $9 201 176 firm-fixed-price contract for the acquisition of non-commercial Husky M20 interrogation arms to support the Husky 2G vehicle.

Work will be performed in Dulles, Virginia, with an estimated completion date of 23 November 2020.\n\nAccording to the Department of Defence National Guard and Reserve Equipment Report for Fiscal Year 2019, published in March 2018, the US Department of Defence will spend $22 920 000 on Huksy Mounted Detection Systems in FY2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Husky is DCD\u2019s flagship route clearance vehicle, and is able to detect mines at 5km/h-35km/h. It uses metal detectors for metallic mines and ground-penetrating radar for non-metal mines, but can be fitted with various sensors and interrogation arms. The Husky comes in several variants, including the single seat Husky Mk III, second generation two seat Husky 2G and optionally unmanned Autonomous Husky. The vehicle can be fitted with a wide variety of sensors and optional extras, including cameras, mine roller system, cyclone blower, remote weapons station, 360-degree camera system, gunshot detection system and RPG protection nets."
