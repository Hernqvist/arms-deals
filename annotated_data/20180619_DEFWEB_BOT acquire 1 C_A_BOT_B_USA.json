  "text": "The Botswana Defence Force (BDF) has acquired a second hand C-212 light transport aircraft to replace one that crashed in 2017.\n\nThe C-212 (N761CA) was seen in Botswana Defence Force Air Wing colours at Lanseria International Airport earlier this week undergoing test flights prior to delivery.\n\nThe aircraft was built in 1998 and was previously owned by Fayard Enterprises LLC of Wake Forest, North Carolina, before being transferred to Botswana. Fayard Enterprises provides mainly skydiving operations with aircraft and maintenance.\n\nThe C-212-400 flew from the United States via Cape Verde at the beginning of February this year. It apparently has fewer than 500 hours on its airframe.\n\nThe Botswana Defence Force Air Wing has in its transport aircraft inventory approximately three C-130B Hercules, ten BN-2 Defenders, two C212s, two CN235s and five Cessna Skymasters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt lost a C-212-300 on 9 February 2017, which killed three people when it came down near Thebephatswana Air Base."
