  "text": "VT Halter Marine of Pascagoula, MS has emerged the victor in one of the most prized and coveted shipbuilding contracts in recent memory, a $746m deal to build the Coast Guard's lead Polar Security Cutter. If two additional ship options are exercised, the total deal could approach $2B.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy, through an Integrated Program Office (IPO), awarded VT Halter Marine Inc., of Pascagoula, Mississippi, a fixed price incentive (firm) contract for the Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) of the Coast Guard\u2019s lead Polar Security Cutter (PSC).\n\nThe initial award is valued at $745.9 million and supports non-recurring engineering and detail design of the PSC class as well as procurement of long lead-time materials and construction of the first ship. The contract also includes options for the construction of two additional PSCs. If all options are exercised, the total contract value is $1.9 billion.\n\nWhen interviewed by Maritime Reporter & Engineering News in the autumn of 2018, newly minted USCG Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz emphasized the importance of this shipbuilding program. \"My philosophy \u2013 my strategy \u2013 is talk about a 6/3/1. We need a minimum of six icebreakers \u2013 that\u2019s consistent with my predecessors \u2013 that\u2019s based on the high latitude study. Within that 6/3/1, a minimum of three heavy, or Polar Security Cutters, and then the one is we need one now. If we don\u2019t start awarding a contract soon, I\u2019m not so sure we can bridge the life span of the Polar Star much beyond a handful of years. The nation really needs to pay attention up there, and the Coast Guard\u2019s the right agency on that.\"\n\nCoast Guard Commandant Karl Schultz tours the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star while in maintenance and repair at a dry dock facility in Vallejo, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018. The Seattle-based Polar Star is the Coast Guard\u2019s only remaining operational heavy icebreaker.

Schultz, Commandant of the Coast Guard. \u201cWith the strong support of both the Trump Administration and the United States Congress, this contract award marks an important step towards building the nation's full complement of six polar icebreakers to meet the unique mission demands that have emerged from increased commerce, tourism, research, and international activities in the Arctic and Antarctic.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of Polar Security Cutters is being jointly managed across the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard through an IPO that leverages the expertise and utilizes best practices across each enterprise to deliver a fleet of highly capable, multi-mission ships in the most cost-efficient and timely manner possible. NAVSEA is the lead contracting authority.\n\n\"This contract award reflects the great benefit achieved by integrating the incredible talents of U.S. Coast Guard and Navy acquisition and shipbuilding professionals to deliver best value at speed,\" said James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition. \"Working with our industry partners, the team identified approximately $300 million in cost avoidances and accelerated the schedule for delivery of this capability to the nation by almost three years. This reflects the urgency in which we are operating to ensure we deliver capabilities necessary to support the U.S. Coast Guard and the nation\u2019s missions in the polar regions.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the first PSC is planned to begin in 2021 with delivery planned for 2024; however, the contract includes financial incentives for earlier delivery.\n\n\n\n"
