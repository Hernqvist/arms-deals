  "text": "WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has instructed the country\u2019s defense industry to develop missile systems to boost its military\u2019s strike capabilities as well as combat unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce its air force, according to Roman Golovchenko, the chairman of the Belarusian State Military Industrial Committee.\n\n\u201cConflicts come to life in various continents. Tensions between superpowers are on the rise. This is why, certainly, there is demand for defensive weapons,\" Golovchenko told the state-run news agency BelTA. \u201cThe Belarusian defense industry is ready to satisfy the demand. I hope the R&D products the head of state has approved will allow us to hit our targets.\u201d\n\nGolovchenko said that the Polonez multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) is the first missile system to be completed by the Belarusian defense industry, and Lukashenko \"has given instructions to develop this sphere in the future\" as a \"key\" field of the country\u2019s military R&D.\n\nPoland makes official request for US rocket launchers Poland's plans to expedite its purchase of the American-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System moves forward, as the country has sent an official letter of request to the U.S. government to proceed with the sale.\n\nBelarus is a member of the Russia-backed Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) which is designed as a counterbalance to NATO. However, Minsk is also developing military cooperation with various countries outside the organization in a bid to mark its independence from Moscow and bolster ties with like-minded governments."
