  "text": "Shanghai: Eleven Chinese warships sailed into the East Indian Ocean this month, a Chinese news portal said, amid a constitutional crisis in the tiny tropical island chain of the Maldives now under a state of emergency.\n\nA fleet of destroyers, at least one frigate, a 30,000-tone amphibious transport dock and three support tankers entered the Indian Ocean, news portal Sina.com.cn said, without linking the deployment to the crisis in the Maldives or giving a reason.\n\n\u201cIf you look at warships and other equipment, the gap between the Indian and Chinese navy is not large,\u201d Sina.com.cn said on Sunday.\n\nIt did not say when the fleet was deployed or for how long.\n\nRivalry between old foes India and China for influence in the Maldives became evident after President Abdulla Yameen signed up to Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond.\n\nIndia, which has had longstanding political and security ties to the islands about 400 km (250 miles) away, has sought to push back against China\u2019s expanding presence in the overwhelmingly Muslim country of 400,000 people. Maldivian opposition leaders have urged New Delhi to intervene in the crisis.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn Friday, the People\u2019s Liberation Army posted photos and a story on rescue training exercises taking place in the East Indian Ocean on its official Twitter-like Weibo account.\n\nChina earlier this month advised Chinese citizens to avoid visiting the Maldives, famous for its luxury hotels, scuba-diving resorts and limpid tropical seas, until political tensions subside.\n\nChina has been striking deals with countries in Asia and Africa in line with its Belt and Road initiative to improve imports of key commodities, upgrade infrastructure and trade routes in the region and boost its diplomatic clout.\n\nYameen imposed the emergency on February 5 for 15 days to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered his government to free those held in prison. He sought parliamentary approval to extend the emergency for 30 days on Monday.\n\nChina has drawn criticism in the West for its perceived military buildup of the neighbouring South China Sea, where it has built and expanded islands and reefs.\n\nChina claims most of the sea where neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims."
