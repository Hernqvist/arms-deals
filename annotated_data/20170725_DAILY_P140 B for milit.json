  "text": "MANILA, Philippines - The Duterte administration will earmark P140 billion to enhance the capabilities of the military next year as it grapples with the threats posed by Islamic extremists and communist rebels.\n\nPresident Duterte said the government could not achieve its development targets without paying attention to the country\u2019s internal security and public order.\n\n\u201cWe will allocate P140.4 billion to beef up the capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP),\u201d Duterte said in his message on the P3.767 trillion national budget for 2018, which was submitted to Congress on Monday.\n\nThe amount is higher by 7.5 percent than the P130.6 billion allotted for the military upgrade program this year.\n\nOf the amount, P25 billion will be allocated to the revised AFP modernization program to fund the purchase of armaments, surveillance, mobility and communications equipment.\n\nThe AFP Modernization Law was enacted in 1995 to improve the capabilities of the military. The law had a total outlay of P331.62 billion but only P63.39 billion of its budget was released. In 2012, then president Benigno Aquino III signed Republic Act 10349, which allotted P75 billion for the military\u2019s modernization program from 2013 to 2017.\n\nDuterte has promised to provide everything the military needs to fight terrorism and insurgency as well as illegal drugs.\n\nDuterte is also allocating P3.1 billion to support the Coast Guard\u2019s modernization program.\n\nHe said the outlay was meant to upgrade their capabilities to cover the country\u2019s territorial waters and coastlines.\n\nThe bulk of the budget or P922 million will be used to buy firearms and service weapons, a helicopter and a watercraft.\n\nThe government is also providing the Philippine National Police P131.5 billion to strengthen efforts against crime and illegal drugs.\n\nSome P1.4 billion will be spent to hire 10,000 new police officers to increase police visibility and to narrow the gap between the ideal police to population ratio of 1:500 from the current ratio of 1:551.\n\nThe administration is also allotting P900 million for the Oplan Double Barrel Reloaded, the government\u2019s flag ship program against illegal drugs.\n\nThe government is also providing the Philippine Statistics Authority P2 billion to roll out the biometrics-based national ID system.\n\nDuterte said the national ID system is needed to ensure that only the rightful recipients would enjoy the benefits offered by anti-poverty programs.\n\nThe government will allot P89.4 billion for the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, which is expected to benefit 4.4 million beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cWe will be strict when it comes to the eligibility requirements of the CCT and in monitoring whether or not its beneficiaries are moving out of the poverty line,\u201d Duterte said."
