  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Following a record year for mergers and acquisitions in the aerospace and defense industry, activity in the sector is strong, despite a fall from last year\u2019s cloud-nine highs, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nThe value of 2018 industry deals to date is $30.3 billion, nearly half the value at the same time last year, but still 48 percent above the $21.3 billion, 10-year annual deal average, the PwC report said.\n\nDeal volume and average deal size are both down from this time last year, 18 and 41 percent respectively, to 290 deals, averaging $197.1 million. Some of this disparity can be accounted for by the lack of a monster, blockbuster deal like United Technologies Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Rockwell Collins for $30 billion last September.\n\nUnlike last year\u2019s four \u201cMegadeals\u201d ($5 billion-plus), only General Dynamics' acquisition of CSRA qualifies so far in 2018.\n\nDespite the lack of any high-value transactions in the third quarter, one notable move is Boeing\u2019s announced agreement to acquire 80 percent of Embraer\u2019s commercial business for $3.8 billion, the PwC report emphasized.\n\nThe report noted that a higher focus on information technology infrastructure, cybersecurity, cloud computing and C4ISR is pushing a number of nontraditional and financial buyers to target diversified IT service organizations.\n\nThe report attributes decreased merger and acquisition activity in the sector to \u201ca slowdown in new orders for aerospace [original equipment manufacturers] and the absence of a significant number of large transactions.\u201d This relatively tame level of activity may be expected to increase as industry becomes \u201cdriven by an increased focus on emerging technologies, intensified competition and [a] rise in government spending to modernize the IT infrastructure,\u201d said Bob Long, U.S. aerospace and defense deals leader for PwC.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
