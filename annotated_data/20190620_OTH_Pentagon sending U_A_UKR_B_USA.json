However, it has only been in the past year that the U.S. has begun shipping lethal military aid to the country, where sporadic clashes continue between government security forces and the militants.\n\nIn 2018, Washington began stepping up its support to Ukraine by providing military equipment, such as anti-tank Javelin missiles. In September, the U.S. Coast Guard transferred two Island-class cutters, armed with .50-caliber machine guns and 25 mm deck guns, to Ukraine to bolster the country\u2019s small navy.\n\nTensions with Russia sparked around the Black Sea in November when the Russian coast guard fired upon and seized three Ukrainian ships that were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait to the Sea of Azov.\n\nIn the months since the incident, the U.S. has called on allies to demonstrate more support for Ukraine. In April, NATO members responded with an agreement to expand their presence in the Black Sea by conducting more port visits. The agreement also focused on improving NATO\u2019s \u201csituational awareness\u201d in the region and stepping up maritime forces training.\n\nThe new funds also will aim to improve the Ukrainian navy and naval infantry\u2019s \u201cmaritime situational awareness and operations,\u201d the Pentagon said.\n\nOther areas of focus are improving the \u201csurvivability\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s ground and special operations forces with counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection equipment and help ensuring secure lines of communication.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92019 the Stars and Stripes\n\nVisit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
