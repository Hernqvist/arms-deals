  "text": "Draken International Tactical air services (Image: Draken)\n\nDraken has won $280 million contract for adversary air aggressor services to the US Air Force.\n\nADAIR services provides tactical fighter jet aircraft flight operations flown by contractor-owned, contractor-operated aircraft simulating non-western aggressor air for the 57th Adversary Tactics Group, the US department of defense said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe contractor will furnish, operate, equip, support and maintain tactically-relevant aircraft for air-to-air tracking, targeting, and ADAIR operations. Aggressor sorties are generated by COCO flight operations, to provide combat air training services that include tactical profiles, to include beyond-visual-range engagements, operational test support, dissimilar air combat maneuvers, offensive and defensive within-visual-range maneuvers, multi-ship tactics, merges, and flight.\n\nADAIR sorties will integrate as part of the Air Force aggressor force in support of ADAIR requirements. Work is expected to be complete by December 2023."
