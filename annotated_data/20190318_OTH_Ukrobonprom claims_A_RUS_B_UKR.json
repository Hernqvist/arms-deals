  "text": "According to the report on the trend of arms trade around the world, almost a quarter of the Ukrainian export was in the Russian Federation during 2014-2018\n\nUkrobonprom responds to SIPRI publication, claiming they have not exported ammunition to the Russian Federation since 2014. The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry reports this.\n\n\u201cIt should be taken into account, that the delivery date of the engines and power constructions was determined by SIPRI experts after the certain types of military equipment and armaments had been produced by Russia. The same is with aircraft and ships, which were transferred to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation then, but not the delivery of individual components in present days. That is why the engines or the power constructions had been delivered till 2014, however, SIPRI publication states it has happened recently\u201d, - Ukrobonprom said.\n\nThey explain that during 2014-2018, Ukraine had been supplying the AI-222 turbojet engines to Russia, which are installed on the Russian Yak-130 combat training aircraft. However, the private enterprise Motor-Sich produces such engines in Zaporizhia, this enterprise is not a part of the state-owned concern. In addition, the supply contracts were signed in 2016, and the actual delivery took place in 2009-2014.\n\nAccording to the report, An-140-100 and An-148-100E aircrafts had been previously exported to the Russian Federation, however, the delivery stopped in 2014. The aircrafts started to manufacture in Russia with a license issued by the state enterprise Antonov.\n\nBesides, Ukraine supplied shipborne gas turbine constructions DS-71 to Russia, produced by the NPK Zorya-Mashproyekt in Mykolaiv (they were equipped with three Russian frigates of the project 11356). The Ukroboronprom claims that they had been delivered before the ban on the export of weapons to the Russian Federation came into force."
