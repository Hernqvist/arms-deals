  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The U.S. Air Force has selected Lockheed Martin to design and prototype a new hypersonic cruise missile, as part of a broad Pentagon push to kickstart America\u2019s hypersonic arsenal.\n\nThe indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the \u201cdesign, development, engineering, systems integration, test, logistics planning, and aircraft integration support of all the elements of a hypersonic, conventional, air-launched, stand-off weapon\u201d was announced by the service April 18.\n\nThe total value for Lockheed could be as high as $928 million over the course of the program\u2019s unspecified timeline. The program is known formally as the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon.\n\n\u201cThis effort is one of two hypersonic weapon prototyping efforts being pursued by the Air Force to accelerate hypersonics research and development,\u201d service spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. \u201cThe Air Force is using prototyping to explore the art-of-the-possible and to advance these technologies to a capability as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe other prototyping program referenced by Stefanek is the Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon. In its FY19 budget request, the Air Force asked for $258 million for the two prototyping experiments.\n\nThe service is also working on two science and technology hypersonic programs, in conjunction with DARPA. Those are the Tactical Boost Glide program, which expects to have a prototype in the 2022-2023 timeframe, and the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC.\n\nHypersonic flight is defined as anything about Mach 5, meaning five times the speed of sound. Such a weapon, if successfully developed, would be able to skirt past existing air defenses and hold enemy forces at risk from great ranges. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson has previously started a focus on developing the technology.\n\n\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Money will be given out through a series of tasking orders, the first of which will come in the next few weeks.\n\nThe announcement comes as Pentagon officials, most vocally Undersecretary of Defense and Research Michael Griffin, have openly called for the need of more investment into hypersonic technology.\n\n\u201cThe most significant advance by our adversaries has been the Chinese development of what is now today a pretty mature system for conventional prompt strike at multi thousand kilometer ranges,\u201d Griffin told the House Armed Services Committee during an April 17 hearing. \u201cWe will, with today\u2019s defensive systems, not see these things coming.\u201d"
