We are grateful for their permission to republish it here.\n\nFor three decades the border between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan has echoed with the crack of gunfire: the ceaseless noise of the oldest \u2018frozen conflict\u2019 in the former USSR. Yet for those living in Nagorno-Karabakh since the ceasefire of 1994 was signed, this border has seemed to drift further and further away, almost vanishing from the horizon of relevance.\n\nGegham Baghdasaryan, the head of the Karabakh Press Club, illustrated this in an anecdote: at an international conference years ago, a young Armenian woman from Karabakh was called to the floor. She was asked about the relationship between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. She replied, \u201cwhat is my relationship to Azerbaijan? I don\u2019t have a relationship. I just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\nThis opinion was far from unique, and was echoed by many in Karabakh. One respondent, a young man in his mid-twenties, said that the events of April \u201copened his eyes\u201d to the \u201creal danger\u201d that Azerbaijan presented. For him and for other young people, the ceasefire had been all they had ever known, and for all the bellicose rhetoric and the slow but constant deaths on the border, it had become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky.\n\nThe ceasefire is all Karabakh\u2019s youth have ever known. Bellicose rhetoric and deaths on the border have become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky\n\nSince the clashes of April 2016 \u2014 four days during which fierce fighting erupted along the line of contact, and ended with over a hundred fatalities, and the seizure by Azerbaijan of several key positions formerly controlled by Armenian forces \u2014 the conflict has taken on a shrill immediacy. The shock which initially gripped the population of Karabakh transformed into anger both at Azerbaijan and at the loss of a sense of normality.\n\nA few years ago, flare-ups in the prolonged conflict might have been seen both by residents and politicians as exceptional, but this most recent violent eruption seems to have solidified in their minds a sense that rather than an exception, war is in fact, the normal state of affairs, and that military interests must circumscribe and submerge all other pursuits.\n\nThe Karabakh war lasted from 1988\u20131994. It claimed over 30,000 lives, displaced almost a million people, and utterly devastated Karabakh\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The region suffered an estimated $5 billion in damage (with a population of only 140,000) \u2014 further compounded by the deindustrialisation that followed the USSR\u2019s collapse.\n\nNevertheless, Nagorno-Karabakh endured. With generous aid from the Republic of Armenia as well as donations from the global Armenian diaspora, Nagorno-Karabakh was rebuilt. By 2007 it had the fastest growing economy in the wider region, with GDP growth rates fluctuating between 10%\u201315% per year. Moreover, unlike Armenia, it did not suffer from demographic decline, with the population increasing by 10% since 2005.\n\nThis quite literal \u201crise from the ashes\u201d is most apparent in Karabakh\u2019s capital, Stepanakert. Formerly a bombed-out city with more than a passing resemblance to post-war Sarajevo, it has in recent years developed into a small yet bustling urban centre, featuring well-paved boulevards, neatly maintained gardens, and a wealth of public amenities.\n\nThe Caucasian tiger\n\n\u2018At first [Karabakh\u2019s economic development] was a patriotic undertaking\u2019, Davit Babayan, speaker for the office of the President of Nagorno-Karabakh, told OC Media. \u2018But that cannot work forever\u2019. He argues that Karabakh\u2019s economic motor for the past decade was a commitment to a \u2018market-driven\u2019 economy, and that only by creating \u2018special conditions for investment\u2019 would Karabakh\u2019s development continue.\n\nOfficially, Nagorno-Karabakh has been on an explicitly market-oriented path since 2007, when under the official direction of its newly elected President Bako Sahayan, it undertook rapid (neo)liberal economic reforms. Examples of this include: the dissolution of the anti-monopoly service (under the slogan \u201cThe Market Will Figure It Out\u201d), the creation of a flat-tax for those categorised as self-employed ($15 a month), and the reduction of regulations on construction licenses (officially it should take only three days for a new license to be approved). The reforms also entailed the privatisation of a series of state-owned assets, most significantly, the regional hydropower utility.\n\nMuch like the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, this \u201cCaucasian Tiger\u201d is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance\n\nConsidered in conjunction with Karabakh\u2019s stellar rates of economic growth, these reforms drew praise from liberal voices in the wider region, with some even calling the region \u201cThe Caucasian Tiger\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a similar vein to the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, Karabakh is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance. Karabakh\u2019s rapid development has been made possible only through significant government intervention in the market and perhaps more importantly, ongoing transfers of funds from the Republic of Armenia. This state of affairs is only made possible through Karabakh\u2019s unique geopolitical and ideological position.\n\nArmenia\u2019s heart\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is without question the single most volatile factor in Armenia\u2019s politics. It is not simply a place, but an idea. It stands in for Armenian nationhood, and in a country where the Armenian Genocide of 1915 still defines foreign policy, it provides a powerful counter-narrative to a sense of historical victimhood. As Karabakh politician Karen Avagimyan told OC Media, Karabakh is \u201cthe spiritual heart of Armenia\u201d.\n\nA banner in central Stepanakert. Photo (c): Khachig Joukhajian / OC Media. All rights reserved.In practical terms this means that if any significant amount of territory in Karabakh is re-taken by Azerbaijan, the government in Yerevan would likely not survive. For instance, in the summer of 2016 a group of Karabakh veterans calling themselves the Sasna Tsrer (the Daredevils of Sasun) seized a police station and called for an uprising against the government. Central to their criticisms of the government was their claim that the current administration intended to cede part of Karabakh to Azerbaijan. While the claim seems to have been spurious, at the time, it helped to mobilise thousands of young people who met with police in violent clashes in defence of the Sasna Tsrer.\n\nThe policies of the Armenian Government towards Karabakh, and the policies of the Karabakh government itself, must be understood in the light of such events. Karabakh\u2019s territorial integrity must be maintained, and all economic and social policies must account for and support this objective.\n\nIn Karabakh, where economic emigration is seen as a threat to national security, neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option\n\nAs Nagorno-Karabakh is an unrecognised state, it is therefore not party to most international trade-treaties. This means the government needs to maintain an investment friendly atmosphere and to advertise this friendliness, if \u201cnon-patriotic\u201d investment (coming primarily from the Russian Federation) is to continue. However, this creates a certain conundrum for the ruling authorities. Investor-friendly and deregulated markets often foster grave societal inequality, with less competitive local workers and small businesses being crushed by economies of scale. As in much of the world, poverty easily transforms into migration, which while quite tolerable for most governments, in Karabakh is simply a non-starter.\n\nIn the eyes of Karabakh officials, the equation of migration is simple: migration equals a lower population, a lower population means fewer soldiers, and fewer soldiers not only makes Karabakh militarily weaker but also incentivises Azerbaijan to attack. This means that the economy cannot be subject to the whims of a capricious market, as population fluctuation resulting from periodic economic crises would quite literally endanger Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option.\n\nMilitarised social democracy\n\nIn practice, the collection of policies enacted to ensure economic stability and liveability in Nagorno-Karabakh can be considered a sort of militarised social democracy: welfare mechanisms are in place to lessen the impact of unemployment or poverty, but they differ from traditional European social democracy in that these mechanisms are tied explicitly to military status.\n\nFor instance, a large portion of the population sits on military pensions, and the families of soldiers killed or wounded on the front are not only financially supported, but often granted free housing or other essentials and amenities. The state also insures all residents who live close to the line of contact, with any damage from the conflict (such as homes damaged by shelling or cattle killed by gunfire) covered by the state.\n\nMarket in Stepanakert, 2012.

In fact, the state often intervenes at the level of the firm, providing subsidies and preferential loans to struggling businesses, keeping them afloat to ensure that a higher level of employment is maintained.\n\nIt may seem like this is a little much for a government presiding over a relatively poor population of 146,000 to accomplish, and that\u2019s because it is. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh is far from self-sufficient. Officially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated for the region, though the real number is likely far higher, especially since any budget transfers related to national defence are classified.\n\nOfficially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated to Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 though the real amount is probably much higher\n\nThis policy direction has only solidified since the April clashes. Villages near the line of contact have become subject to new legislative classification as \u201cborder villages\u201d. Here, according to Speaker of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Artak Beglaryan, the government\u2019s explicit purpose is to maintain, and if possible, increase the population in order to create a presence that would detect and deter Azerbaijani attacks. This is a difficult task, as these villages are directly in the line of fire \u2014 an understandable disincentive for citizens to continue living there.\n\nWhich is why under the auspices of this new legislation the government has increased subsidies for these villages \u2014 for instance, creating a gas and electricity subsidy that, for some households, entirely covers their monthly bills \u2014 as well as providing financial incentives (again subsidies, as well as tax breaks) for investment in border villages in order to stimulate employment.\n\nBut the lengths to which the government is willing to leave behind neoliberal economic orthodoxy is most apparent in the village most affected by the conflict: Talish.\n\nA kolkhoz by any other name\n\nIn the dawn hours of 2 April 2016, the north-western heights above the small village of 500 were overrun by the Azerbaijani military. By the time Armenian forces retook Talish, it had been reduced to rubble, and even after the ceasefire was signed, the strategic hills overlooking the village remained in Azerbaijani hands.\n\nWith most of the homes destroyed, the people of Talish have become homeless, living with relatives or in state-provided housing in nearby villages further away from the line of contact. However, even in its current strategically vulnerable position, the Karabakh government is committed to rebuilding Talish, and having its residents return.\n\nArmenian militia in Talish, a village in the Martakert region of the self-declared Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, April 2016.

New buildings will also be added, including a house of culture and a recreation centre. But these are not the most ambitious plans for the village; in order to ensure a high level of employment and a strong degree of social solidarity, the village is rebuilding its agricultural and production capacities in a collective model.\n\nIn the words of Talish Mayor Vilen Petrosyan, \u201cIt will be like a Soviet kolkhoz (collective farm - ed.), but different. Instead of giving our profits to the government, the community will decide what to do with them\u201d. The beginnings of this new/old model are already in place. The Talish \u2018collective\u2019 is producing honey, fruit and vegetables, spirits, meat, and dairy \u2014 with several dozen workers employed by the social enterprise composed of former Talish residents (entirely men) who have returned to the village as government contractors, working to rebuild their homes and defend them in case of an attack.\n\nWhether the model will work, and if it will actually be democratic, remains to be seen. But for the local administration, the hope is that the new Talish will not only flourish, but become a model of economy and governance for other villages in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nGoing nowhere\n\nFrom 1994 onwards, the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh have been holding out hope for a peaceful normalisation of their situation. But as repeated peace deals floundered, and a deep chill descended, many began to adapt to a new status quo. Even if peace never came, life would go on. But the events of April 2016 shattered this uneasy sense of stability.\n\nIn a strange irony however, as the Karabakh people\u2019s sense of stability was shattered, the existing economic and political order only grew stronger. As a region forged in the crucible of conflict and still enduring its ravages almost thirty years later, Nagorno-Karabakh has ceased being a place where the military exists to support state and society. Rather state and society now exist to support the military. And that is unlikely to change any time soon."
