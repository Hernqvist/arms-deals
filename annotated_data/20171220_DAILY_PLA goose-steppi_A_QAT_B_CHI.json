For historical reasons, Qatar had relied on British drill regulations in its previous National Day military parades.\n\nAfter the parade, Qatar\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense Affairs Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah received the PLA trainers, speaking highly of their work and the results.\n\nHe said that Qatar is willing to further enhance cooperation with China."
