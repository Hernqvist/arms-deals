By 2035, Russia stands to have a fleet of 13 heavy icebreakers, including nine nuclear-powered ones, he said.\n\nThe Russian leader said that Russia plans to expand the ports on both sides of the Arctic shipping route \u2014 Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula \u2014 and invited foreign companies to invest in the reconstruction project.\n\nOther ports and infrastructure facilities along the route will also be upgraded and expanded, he said.\n\nRussia, the U.S., Canada, Denmark and Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over parts of the Arctic as shrinking polar ice creates new opportunities for resource exploration and new shipping lanes.\n\nThis map released by Republican U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska in 2017 to support his amendments to national defence funding purports to show the locations of military outposts Russia has in the far north. (Office of Senator Dan Sullivan)\n\nSpeaking at the forum, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg emphasized the need to respect international law and noted that the Arctic Council provides a key arena for dialogue.\n\n\"Now and then I hear the Arctic described as a geopolitical hot spot,\" she said. \"This is not how we see it. We know the Arctic as a region of peace and stability.\"\n\nShe noted that \"this should not be taken for granted,\" adding \"it is the result of political decisions and practical co-operation between the Arctic states.\"\n\n\"Respect for international law and regional co-operation are keys to ensuring peace and stability across borders,\" Solberg said.\n\nSolberg and other leaders who spoke at the forum underlined the need for all countries in the Arctic region to focus on areas of mutual interest despite differences.\n\nRussia building up 'necessary defence capability'\n\nThe Russian military has revamped and modernized a string of Soviet-era military bases across the polar region, looking to protect its hold on the region, which is believed to hold up to one-quarter of the Earth's undiscovered oil and gas.\n\nAddressing the forum, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that military deployments in the Arctic are intended to protect national interests.\n\n\"We ensure the necessary defence capability in view of the military-political situation near our borders,\" Lavrov said, noting that a recent NATO exercise in Norway was openly directed against Russia.\n\nRussia's relations with the U.S. and other NATO allies have plummeted to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria, Moscow's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other issues.\n\nPutin used the forum to criticize U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine, but emphasized that they wouldn't hamper the country's plans to expand its presence in the Arctic.\n\nHe charged that the U.S. has used the economic restrictions as a tool to protect its economic interests, citing Washington's opposition to a prospective pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would carry Russian gas to Germany as an example."
