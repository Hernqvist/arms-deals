  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump finalized an $854 billion spending bill on Friday that fully funds the military for fiscal 2019 and prevents a government shutdown next week, accomplishments that congressional leaders have called important and laudable.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s signature came with one final attack on Democrats over the spending measure, lamenting lawmakers\u2019 decision not to include extra money in the appropriations package for his planned wall along the southern U.S. border.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the radical Democrats refuse to support border security and want drugs and crime to pour into our country,\u201d he said in a statement after signing the bill.\n\nNo shutdown: House finalizes FY19 military budget, and Trump drops his opposition The president says he will sign the funding measure, which gives the military its full-year budget on schedule for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe comments came just a week after Trump took to social media to blast \u201cthis ridiculous Spending Bill,\u201d raising fears of a presidential veto on Capitol Hill. Instead, Trump largely praised the measure on Friday, calling it \u201cimportant legislation to rebuild our military\u201d and promote other domestic priorities.\n\nThe appropriations measure includes $674 billion in defense funding for fiscal 2019, and marks the first time in a decade Congress has finalized the spending measure before the start of the new fiscal year.\n\nThe measure funds a 2.6 percent pay raise for troops starting next January and a boost in military end strength of 16,400 spread across the active-duty and reserve forces.\n\nTrump, in his statement, praised the measure for including \u201c93 new F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighters, 142 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, and 13 Navy battle force ships \u2014 made right here in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
