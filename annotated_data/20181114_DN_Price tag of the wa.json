  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The price tag of the ongoing \u201cwar on terror\u201d in the Middle East will likely top $6 trillion next year, and will reach $7 trillion if the conflicts continue into the early 2020s, according to a new report out Wednesday.\n\nThe annual Costs of War project report, from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, puts the full taxpayer burden of fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria over the last 17 years at several times higher than official Defense Department estimates, because it includes increases in Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs spending, as well as new military equipment and personnel.\n\n\u201cBecause the nation has tended to focus its attention only on direct military spending, we have often discounted the larger budgetary costs of the post-9/11 wars, and therefore underestimated their greater budgetary and economic significance,\u201d the new report states.\n\nDirect military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan make up nearly $1.8 trillion in costs, but researchers estimate the long-term health care of veterans from those wars could equal or surpass that figure in coming decades.\n\nThey also charge that the Defense Department\u2019s base budget has grown more than $900 billion over the last 17 years because of increased missions, recruiting costs and service member benefits brought on by the conflicts overseas.\n\n\u201cHigh costs in war and war-related spending pose a national security concern because they are unsustainable,\u201d study author Neta Crawford said in the report. \u201cThe public would be better served by increased transparency and by the development of a comprehensive strategy to end the wars and deal with other urgent national security priorities.\u201d\n\nVA secretary expects fiscal 2020 budget to be the biggest ever Trump wants a 5 percent spending cut for every department next year, but his top veterans' official expects Congress to add the money back in.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

About 14,000 of that group are American troops.\n\nMore than 4 million veterans in America today served during the Iraq and Afghanistan war era.\n\nThe full report is available on the project\u2019s web site."
