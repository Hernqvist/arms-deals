Additional German companies will be joining Boeing\u2019s industrial plan for collaboration on communication and mission systems integration. This industrial plan will provide the German government a local long-term support and training solution including aircraft maintenance; aircrew and technical training; research, development and technology; and supply chain enhancements.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong team behind our Chinook offer to Germany,\u201d said Michael Hostetter, director, Vertical Lift Programs in Germany. \u201cThe Chinook is a modern, proven and reliable heavy-lift helicopter with a high availability rate and low maintenance requirements. Boeing and its German industry team stand ready to support the requirements of the German government, the Bundeswehr and the men and women in uniform that will be flying and maintaining the aircraft.\u201d\n\nBoeing is focused on providing a low risk, proven and reliable solution to the customer on time and at a very competitive cost. The German partners were carefully selected to provide additional capabilities, value and local expertise to the highly efficient platform and logistics solution, while maintaining the reliability and low-risk approach that is the hallmark of the Chinook program. Additional partners to the Boeing Germany team will be announced at a later date.\n\n\u201cWith these partnerships, Boeing is providing opportunities for German industry to join Boeing\u2019s established supplier network in Germany or to expand their existing scope of work with Boeing,\u201d said Dr. Michael Haidinger, president, Boeing Germany. Boeing appreciates the technology leadership of the German aerospace industry and continues to work across its German supply base to grow the scope of work on Boeing\u2019s commercial, defense, space, security, and services businesses.\n\nThe Chinook is the most advanced transport rotorcraft in the United States Army inventory, with the expectation that it will remain in service into the 2060\u2019s. As chosen by the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Canada, the Chinook gives Germany interoperability that other helicopters cannot while meeting a wide range of mission needs.\n\nBoeing Germany\n\nBoeing has been a strong contributor to the German economy for many decades. Today Boeing directly employs approximately 600 people at 11 locations throughout Germany and sustains many thousands additional jobs in Germany through its supply chain and other activities. In 2016, Boeing and its supply-chain partners spent almost $1.3 billion with its established network of nearly 100 suppliers located across Germany. Boeing works together with many more sub-tier and German-owned suppliers worldwide. Germany is a key market for Boeing to invest in research and technology partnerships. Boeing has established two research sites in Germany, the Research & Technology Office in Munich and the Digital Aviation & Analytics Lab in Neu-Isenburg near Frankfurt and invests in a growing portfolio of research and technology projects with German industry, universities and research organizations.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BoeingDefense, @BoeingDACH\n\n# # #\n\nContact:\n\nMarcia Costley\n\nDefense, Space & Security\n\nOffice: +1 310-364-8409\n\nMobile: +1 714-316-4267\n\nmarcia.b.costley@boeing.com\n\nB\u00e9atrice Bracklo\n\nBoeing Germany, Austria, Switzerland\n\nOffice: +49 30 77377 106\n\nMobile: +49 172 4125525\n\nbeatrice.bracklo@boeing.com"
