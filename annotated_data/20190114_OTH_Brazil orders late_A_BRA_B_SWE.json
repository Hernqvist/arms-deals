  "text": "Saab announced on 14 January that it has signed a contract with the Brazilian Army for deliveries of the latest generation of the RBS 70 man-portable surface-to-air missile systems.\n\nThe Brazilian Army sign a contract with Sweden\u2019s Saab Dynamics to buy RBS 70 NG \u2013 the latest generation of the RBS 70 man-portable air defense system.\n\nIn addition to the RBS 70 NG system, the order also includes training systems, camouflage systems and other associated equipment. This is the Brazilian Army\u2019s first order of the latest RBS 70 NG version and marks a significant upgrade to their air defence capability. Their existing RBS 70 inventory has been in service with the Brazilian Army since 2014. The system had a big role in 2016 as it was a part of the protection of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -\n\n\u201cWe welcome the Brazilian Army as our latest customer for the RBS 70 NG. We see their decision to continue to select us as clear proof of their confidence in Saab\u2019s state of the art air defence solution. The RBS 70 NG offers a day/night capability, unjammable laser guidance and an automatic target tracker that ensures the missile hits its target,\u201d says G\u00f6rgen Johansson, Head of Saab business area Dynamics.\n\nRBS 70 will be integrated into the army\u2019s shelter-mounted mobile anti-aircraft artillery command-and-control system (COAAe) and coupled to SABER M60 3D surveillance and target acquisition radar, both from the Braxilian army\u2019s Technological Center (CTEx) and BRADAR (formerly OrbiSat da Amaz\u00f3nia).\n\nThe Saab portfolio of short-range ground-based air defence missile systems includes the RBS 70 and the latest version, RBS 70 NG. The RBS 70 system has an impressive track-record on the market with more than 1,600 launchers and over 17,000 missiles delivered to nineteen countries.\n\nThis order was booked during Q4 2018."
