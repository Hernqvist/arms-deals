  "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."
