(Photo: Fred Troilo, Boeing)\n\nPHILADELPHIA, Pa., Sept. 24, 2018 \u2014 Boeing [NYSE: BA] will provide its MH-139 helicopter and related support to the U.S. Air Force to replace the more than 40-year-old UH-1N \u201cHuey\u201d helicopters used to protect America\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile bases.\n\nThe program awarded today is valued at $2.4 billion for up to 84 helicopters, training devices and associated support equipment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for the Air Force\u2019s confidence in our MH-139 team,\u201d said David Koopersmith, vice president and general manager, Boeing Vertical Lift. \u201cThe MH-139 exceeds mission requirements, it\u2019s also ideal for VIP transport, and it offers the Air Force up to $1 billion in acquisition and lifecycle cost savings.\u201d\n\nThe MH-139 derives from the Leonardo AW139, which is used by more than 270 governments, militaries and companies worldwide. Leonardo will assemble the helicopters at its northeast Philadelphia plant, with Boeing integrating military-specific components at its facility south of that city.\n\nThe contract also includes operations, maintenance, training systems and support equipment for the MH-139 aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to provide the U.S. Air Force with solutions across the entire services ecosystem,\u201d said Ed Dolanski, president of U.S. Government Services, Boeing Global Services. \u201cWith the AW139 platform\u2019s more than 2 million flight hours and established supply chain, we look forward to applying our expertise to drive cost savings while supporting mission readiness.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Defense, Space & Security and Global Services, visit www.boeing.com.
