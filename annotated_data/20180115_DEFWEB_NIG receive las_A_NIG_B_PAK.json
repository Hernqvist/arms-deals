  "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has taken delivery of the final batch of five Super Mushshak trainer aircraft from Pakistan.\n\nThe five disassembled Super Mushshaks arrived in Kaduna, Nigeria, on 14 January aboard an Il-76 transport aircraft. They were received by the Chief of Logistics Air Vice Marshal Bello Garba. The newly delivered aircraft will now be assembled in Nigeria by a team of Pakistan Air Force and NAF technicians prior to test flying and formal induction into the NAF.\n\nAir Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, Director of Public Relations and Information at the Nigerian Air Force, said in a statement that the NAF took delivery of the first batch of five new Super Mushshaks on 14 July 2017, following which the aircraft were inducted and deployed for primary training of NAF pilots. Some NAF personnel had undergone training in Pakistan, as instructor pilots and technicians on the Super Mushshak, as part of the contract.\n\nAdesanya noted that by 2015, local primary flying training in the NAF was almost grounded, necessitating the procurement of new trainers. \u201cConsequently, with the delivery of the new Super Mushshak aircraft, primary flying training of NAF pilots at 401 Flying Training School (FTS), Kaduna has just received a boost. Without doubts, the delivery of the aircraft would go a long way in helping to sustain the process of building capacity to effectively prosecute the counterinsurgency operations in the North East as well as other forms of criminalities in the country.\u201d\n\nWhilst it awaited the delivery of the ten new Super Mushshaks from Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), the NAF in December 2016 received four Pakistan Air Force examples to use temporarily. These were returned to Pakistan in October 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria signed a contract for ten Super Mushshaks on 21 October 2016 with Pakistan Aeronautical Complex Kamra."
