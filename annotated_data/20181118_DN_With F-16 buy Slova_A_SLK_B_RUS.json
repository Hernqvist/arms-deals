  "text": "HALIFAX, Canada \u2014 NATO member Slovakia is on track to purchase 14 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighters to replace its MiG-29 jets in a wider effort to break from Russia, the Slovak Ministry of Defence\u2019s No. 2 official said Saturday.\n\nIn an interview on the sidelines of the Halifax International Security Forum, MoD State Secretary R\u00f3bert Ondrejcs\u00e1k said of the Russian defense industrial relationship: \u201cWe are cutting off as quickly as we can.\n\n\u201cThe most important connection with Russia is still the MiG-29, which is still Russian manufactured, and it\u2019s what we are cutting now with the decision about the F-16s,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said. \u201cThere several are other smaller systems.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Slovakia also expects to receive five more Sikorsky UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, which completes its planned purchase of nine. (Long-term plans call for at least 18 multi-role helicopters to replace Soviet-designed Mi-17 rotorcraft, though no platform has been selected as yet.)\n\n\u201cBy replacing them, we are also cutting those ties with Russia,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, adding that Slovakia will fly the UH-60 and Mi-17 for several years while the UH-60 is phased in.\n\nSlovakia was a part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War but joined the European Union and the NATO military alliance in 2004.\n\nSlovakian officials understand the purchase of American hardware strengthens their strategic relationship, but Ondrejcs\u00e1k emphasized \u2014 on the anniversary of Czechoslovakia\u2019s velvet revolution in 1989 \u2014 the partnership is based on faith in liberal democratic values.\n\n\u201cWe want to see America as a leader in the free world, as they did for 70 years,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said. \u201cWe hear a lot here [at Halifax] about the values-based international order, but it\u2019s very real for us.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nNATO member Slovakia is on track to purchase 14 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighters to replace its MiG-29 jets, part of a wider effort to break from Russia, Slovak Ministry of Defense State Secretary R\u00f3bert Ondrejcs\u00e1k said on the sidelines of the 2018 Halifax International Security Forum.\n\nBeyond the U.S., leaders of Slovakia and the Czech Republic announced in September the two countries will cooperate on joint purchases of weapons and military equipment. Both have moved to increase their respective defense budgets following Russia\u2019s alleged military intervention in Ukraine\u2019s eastern part and its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nAs to the F-16s, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said the intent is for his government to finalize the legislative vehicle and contract in the coming months to ensure timely delivery of the first F-16s in 2022 or 2023.\n\nIn part driven by maintenance costs, Slovakia decided to make a switch from the MiG-29 and ultimately chose the F-16V over the Saab Gripen based on price and internal analysis, according to Ondrejcs\u00e1k.\n\nThe announcement came in July after U.S. State Department in April approved the potential sale of 14 Block 70/72 F-16Vs for Slovakia.\n\nOtherwise, negotiations are also underway for the U.S. to further improve Slovakian air fields in Slia\u010d, which is in central Slovakia and in Malacky, which is in in Western Slovakia.\n\n\u201cWe take it as a win-win situation because they are investing in infrastructure, which will be crucial for us too,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said of the U.S. military. \u201cOf course its good for them (the U.S. military) because in case of potential operations, they (the airfields) are available.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has ramped up investments that would enable it to deploy to allied bases in Eastern Europe and operate close to Russia\u2019s western flank. U.S. air field improvements have already included partner air bases in Hungary, Estonia and elsewhere.\n\nAs Slovakia upgrades its heavy mechanized units, it is also exploring the modernization of its existing fleet of T-72 main battle tanks, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, rather than wait for the next generation of MBT to be developed. No platform has been selected."
