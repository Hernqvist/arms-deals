Though the budget allocation does amount to a double-digit hike over the previous year, that hike is worth keeping in perspective given previous drastic cuts to the defense budget as well as lingering economic challenges that the Southeast Asian state continues to face.\n\nAs I have noted before, Brunei\u2019s defense budget has come under growing strain over the past few years due to broader economic challenges. The tiny, oil-rich sultanate is highly dependent on the energy sector \u2013 with oil and gas accounting for over 70 percent of the country\u2019s nominal GDP and almost all of its exports, by one estimate. Declining energy prices have put pressure on government finances, resulting in rising deficits and multiple years of negative growth. The defense budget has been significantly affected, with more modest increases and some large double-digit cuts.\n\nLast week, Brunei\u2019s defense ministry confirmed that the country\u2019s defense budget had been set at just over 492.75 million Brunei dollars (US$375 million). The new figure constitutes an increase of about 12.9 percent over the previous year. And in his remarks to Brunei\u2019s 14th Legislative Council, Brunei\u2019s Minister of Defense II, Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Rtd) Dato Paduka Seri Haji Awang Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, eloquently reiterated the importance of defense in terms of the country\u2019s broader goals, including preserving the country\u2019s security and achieving its much-ballyhooed Wawasan 2035 vision.\n\nYet the hike ought to be kept in perspective. The BN$492.75 million figure is an increase from the previous year but still remains far below the BN$719.15 million figure from 2014 before a couple of drastic cuts. A major cut in 2015 of around 25 percent was followed by a modest increase and then another drastic 20 percent cut the following year. And as I hinted at above, the increasing pressures on the defense budget were also not all visible in terms of an observed decrease in numbers, thanks to shifts in components of the budget and other workarounds.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

Indeed, the seven areas that the minister mentioned in his remarks \u2013 protecting its territorial integrity; preserving a high level of preparedness and readiness; supporting a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d approach; conducting effective defense diplomacy; involvement in international missions; sustaining high standards in terms of human resource capacity; and maintaining a respectable and credible image for the country\u2019s defense organization \u2013 were quite familiar.\n\nEnjoying this article?

The answers to that question have more to do with individual decisions Brunei makes on its own and with its partners, rather than just a statistic about the rises and falls in its defense budgets."
