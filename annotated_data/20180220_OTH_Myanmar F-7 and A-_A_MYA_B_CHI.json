Being extensively used in Rakhine.Old A 5K attack aircraft are still operational and many of them are converted into twin seat 5 KJ fighter trainer.A 5KJ are used not just for training but also effectively used in COIN operations.Old F 7IIK are also upgraded with new engines and still operational.Although F 7IIK are no longer in first line operation, MAF intended to use these aircraft in countering enemy's rotary wing aircraft in the field operations.The only aircrafts retired from the service in the past 20 years are Sokol, Bell 205/212 and PC 6/7/9.So there is no point that MAF will give retire MiG 29 before 2030.They even started ambitious modernization programme for MiG 29. About 12 MiG 29 are already upgraded to MiG 29SM standard.A 5KJ seen together with A 5K in Ex Sin Phyu Shin.Close up of A 5KJ.Upgraded Mi 2.G 4 Super Galeb."
