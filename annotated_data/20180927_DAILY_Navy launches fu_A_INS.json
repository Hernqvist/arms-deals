Siwi Sukma Adji launched on Wednesday auxiliary support vessel KRI Bontang 907 at the PT Batamec shipyard in Batam, Riau Islands.\n\n\u201cThis boat will support the activities of the Navy\u2019s warships, so they no longer have to return to base but can be resupplied in the middle of the sea,\u201d Siwi said.\n\nThe fuelboat will initially be assigned to Natuna waters bordering the South China Sea to support Indonesian warships in the area.\n\nConstruction of the boat started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed at the end of this year. The boat is 123.5 meters long,16.5 m wide and can carry up to 5,500 cubic m of fuel and 109 special forces crew members.\n\nSiwi added that the KRI Bontang was part of the Navy\u2019s strategic five-year defense development plan and would replace older fuelboats that have been in use for more than 25 years.\n\n\u201cThis boat will strengthen the operations of our warships in the middle of the sea, as the warships will be able to conduct longer operations,\u201d he said.
