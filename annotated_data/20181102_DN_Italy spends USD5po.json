  "text": "ROME \u2014 Italy has spent slightly more than \u20ac5 billion (U.S. $5.7 billion) on defense procurement in 2018 and launched a series of new programs, a newly released spending document has revealed.\n\nPublished months behind schedule, the Defence Ministry document also states that the ministry\u2019s overall budget, which includes its contribution to procurement as well as funds for personnel and maintenance and operations, stood at \u20ac13.8 billion this year, up from \u20ac13.2 billion the year before.\n\nThe total budget for procurement combines a \u20ac2.3 billion contribution from the Defence Ministry funding with a \u20ac2.8 billion top-up from Italy\u2019s Ministry of Economic Development, which has long shored up acquisition funding.\n\nA chart published in the document shows that procurement funding from the defense ministry has risen 83 percent from \u20ac1.5 billion in 2008, and overtook Defence Ministry procurement in 2016 for the first time.\n\nThe figures are contained in Italy\u2019s annual defense spending document, which is due to be examined by the Italian parliament\u2019s defense commission next week and has been seen by Defense News.\n\nItaly plans to slash half a billion dollars from defense in 2019 Italy will suspend helicopter and missile purchases and cancel an office move by the defense ministry, a defense source has told Defense News, and also slow roll F-35 buys.\n\nThe document breaks down spending per program in 2018 and lists new programs receiving funding for the first time, including four new Chinook helicopters for special forces troops, which will cost \u20ac528 million over nine years.\n\nLaunch funding is also allotted for the purchase of a third pair of U212 submarines for the Italian Navy, a program due to cost a total of \u20ac2.35 billion. There is also launch funding for a second pair of Cosmo Skymed Second Generation radar satellites which will cost a total of \u20ac212 million.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
