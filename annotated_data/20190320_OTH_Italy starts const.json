RHIBS up to 11 meter in length will be deployed through lateral cranes or a hauling ramp located at the far stern.\n\nITS Paolo Thaon di Revel, the first of the PPA shps, is scheduled to be delivered in 2021.\n\nA total of seven PPA vessels are to be built as part of the Italian Navy\u2019s fleet renewal plan, approved by the government and parliament in May 2015."
