The newly minted combined aerospace business would have had sales of about $39 billion last year, United Technologies said.\n\nHayes will stay on as CEO of the aerospace business. The company did not name leaders for the separated Otis and Carrier businesses.\n\nFounded in 1934, United Technologies is based in Farmington, Connecticut, and currently employs about 205,000 people. It did not say if any jobs would be lost in the breakup.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
