  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate leaders have reached a two-year deal that would set defense spending at $700 billion for 2018 and $716 billion for 2019.\n\nThose top-lines, part of a deal announced by Senate leaders Wednesday afternoon, hews to those authorized by National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 and President Donald Trump\u2019s expected 2019 defense budget.\n\nNot all of the details were announced immediately, as bipartisan talks continued, but sources close to them said spending limits for defense and non-defense combined would be raised by $300 billion over two years.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how the deal will address budget caps and how much of the defense funding will be sought as cap-exempt Overseas Contingency Operations funding.\n\nThe caps, excluding OCO or Department of Energy funding, limit the Defense Department\u2019s base budget to $549 billion for fiscal 2018 and $562 billion for fiscal 2019.\n\nThe emerging deal still may face opposition from House fiscal conservatives over proposed increases to the non-defense side of the budget and from House Democrats who sought a vote on protections for young immigrants.\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a Senate floor speech the agreement would, \u201cunwind the sequestration cuts that have hamstrung the military and jeopardized our national security.\u201d\n\nHouse GOP\u2019s six-week continuing resolution offers military, health care funding The current short-term spending bill expires on Feb. 8. If a new spending plan isn\u2019t adopted by then, lawmakers will trigger another partial closure of government operations.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Jim Inhofe, of Oklahoma.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel walks toward the Senate chamber W3ednesday. Sen.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, calling the increases \u201csubstantial, much needed.\u201d\n\nGraham said the increase would address readiness, a maintenance backlog and manpower increases, saying \u201cThis is the biggest step toward rebuilding the military I\u2019ve seen since 2011.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an increase for non-defense spending, maybe more than some would like, but I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe FBI could use the money.\u201d\n\nWhether the deal will lift the debt ceiling ahead of a mid-March deadline, had not been finalized, according to the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas.\n\n\n\nLawmakers must still reach an agreement to pass a continuing resolution that averts a shutdown when the last one expires on Thursday.\n\nThe chairmen of the armed services committees, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voiced support in a joint statement Wednesday. The $700 billion top-line reflects the amount authorized by their panels\u2019 annual defense policy bill."
