  "text": "Kiev \u2013 Following the Intergovernmental Agreement signed between France and Ukraine on 8 June, Airbus Helicopters has signed a contract with the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior for the purchase of 55 civil helicopters destined for search and rescue (SAR), public services, and emergency medical service (EMS) missions in the country. The 55 aircraft include 21 repurposed H225s, and 10 brand new H145s and 24 H125. The contract, which also foresees the setting up of a local training and maintenance centre, was signed in Kiev on 14 July in the presence of Arsen Avakov, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Ukraine, and Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.\n\nThe heavy twin-engine H225 aircraft ordered by Ukraine, for which the French State currently holds economic rights, will be repurposed to suit public services and search & rescue missions for which the aircraft is recognised as a reference helicopter. The H225 features include a takeoff sequence of less than five minutes, an extra long-range capability with auxiliary fuel tanks, and its world-renowned autopilot and upper SAR modes. The first H225 helicopters are expected to land in Kiev before the end of 2018.\n\nA world leader in the EMS segment and parapublic missions, the Airbus H145 is the latest member of its 4-tonne-class twin-engine rotorcraft product range \u2013 with designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions. Compact in size, this helicopter\u2019s small footprint and large, flexible cabin make it the aircraft of choice for a variety of civil missions.\n\nThe H125, an Airbus bestseller, is a light single-engine helicopter that has earned its reputation as a true multi-mission workhorse thanks to its high levels of performance, exceptional manoeuvrability, excellent visibility and low vibration levels in the cabin, with an optimized maintenance plan that contributes to reduced operating costs for the customer. The aircraft, with its new flat floor can be quickly and easily reconfigured for various missions, including aerial work, firefighting, law enforcement, search and rescue, and passenger transport.\n\nAbout Airbus\n\nAirbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2017 it generated revenues of \u20ac 59 billion restated for IFRS 15 and employed a workforce of around 129,000.
