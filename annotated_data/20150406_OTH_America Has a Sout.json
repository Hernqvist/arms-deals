  "text": "The KATUSA program arose from a shared history of war with North Korea. Both American and South Korean troops fought together, so it made sense to make it official.\n\nGen. Douglas MacArthur and South Korean Pres. Syngman Rhee crafted the arrangement in 1950, and both viewed these \u201caugmentees\u201d as critical to their shared war efforts.\n\nIn June 1950, a North Korean blitzkrieg had pushed Washington and Seoul\u2019s ill-prepared troops into a tiny pocket around the port city of Busan at the southeastern tip of the peninsula.\n\nWith Pyongyang\u2019s forces closing in, MacArthur was desperate for more manpower. Rhee wanted to find ways to improve his fledgling army.\n\nThe chaos of war, along with a cultural and language barriers\u2014and just flat out racism\u2014caused serious difficulties for the program. While in need of extra soldiers, many American commanders distrusted or dismissed the Korean volunteers.\n\n\u201cAn inordinately large percentage of men, particularly in some units, stated at KATUSAs were no good, that they would sleep on guard, \u2018bug out,\u2019 refuse to work or pretend not to know what was expected of them,\u201d an Army team sent to evaluate the service\u2019s performance reported.\n\nDespite orders from Pres. Harry Truman to integrate, Eighth Army had arrived in Korea with official racial boundaries still firmly in place.\n\n\u201cThis mistrust may stem from fact or it may result from pre-existing attitudes,\u201d the team explained. \u201cMany people made the statement that a KATUSA or Puerto Rican or Negro is either an excellent fighter, or he is no good at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf such \u2018extremes\u2019 exist it seems highly likely that they are not inherited.\u201d\n\nIn spite of these barriers, more than 6,000 KATUSAs had given their lives by the end of the war. After the Korean Armistice Agreement stopped the shooting, the Pentagon kept the program going as an established method of training South Korean troops.\n\nNearly 10 years after the armistice, Washington and Seoul agreed to use the arrangement to bulk up Army units throughout the country. In 1968, there were still more than 10,000 KATUSAs aiding the ground combat branch in Korea, according to one Pentagon memo.\n\nThe relative skill level between South Korean troops and their American comrades\u2014and perhaps continuing mistrust\u2014was still an issue. \u201cKATUSA personnel cannot be used in intelligence units to replace U.S. personnel,\u201d the Pentagon memo declared.\n\nAnd for decades, the U.S. essentially had veto power over the South Korean military. The American officer in charge of the Eighth Army \u2014 who had a shared headquarters with South Korean troops called the Combined Forces Command \u2014 was the de facto highest ranking military official in the country.\n\nIn 1994, the two countries finally agreed to allow South Korea\u2014an established sovereign state and growing regional economic powerhouse\u2014to oversee its own military affairs \u2026 during peacetime.\n\nToday, if another war broke out on the peninsula, the Pentagon would still direct South Korean troops at the highest levels."
