Now the armored personnel carrier is in service in four countries.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the BTR was actively used during military operations in the East of Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. Almost 80 BTR-4E enhanced Ukrainian Army during military operation in the East of the country. Also the fact that BTR-4 has repeatedly proved its endurance on the battlefield in Iraq.\n\nTurkey\u2019s FNSS Savunma Sistemleri armoured vehicle manufacturer promotes its 8\u00d78 Pars II armoured vehicles. FNSS claims that the hull design of the Pars II offers a higher level of protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), with all crew members provided with blast shock mitigation seats.\n\nThe vehicles employ the latest designs and technologies with a focus on the performance and durability of modern military operational requirements. The vehicles are available in 4X4, 6X6 and 8X8 configurations. The PARS family of vehicles takes its name from the \u201cAnatolian Leopard\u201d."
