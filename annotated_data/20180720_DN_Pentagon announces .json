  "text": "Days after President Donald Trump challenged whether the U.S. should honor its Article 5 collective defense commitments to defend tiny NATO member Montenegro, the Pentagon reassured its Eastern European allies it would continue to be a deterrent presence against Russian aggression and committed an additional $200 million to the defense of Ukraine.\n\nThe funds will go toward \u201ctraining, equipment and advisory efforts to build the defensive capacity of Ukraine\u2019s forces,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe new funds bring the total amount of U.S. assistance to $1 billion since Russian-backed forces invaded Crimea in 2014.\n\nCongress would stop Trump from leaving NATO, key senators say \u201cIf they were seriously planning on withdrawing from NATO, I think it would create a unifying event unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in U.S. history,\u201d says Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\nThe new funds are a sharp contrast to comments Trump made to Fox News after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s comments seemed to stun NATO member countries, who have been working with the U.S. to increase military rotations and shorten the amount of time it would take for forces to assemble along Europe\u2019s eastern flank to deter against any further Russian incursions. Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017.\n\n\u201cYou know, Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people... . They are very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations, you\u2019re in World War III. But that\u2019s the way it was set up,\" Trump said.\n\nOn Thursday the government of Montenegro issued a response to Trump\u2019s remarks, emphasizing their commitment to NATO and contributions to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, it does not matter how big or small you are, but to what extent you cherish the values of freedom, solidarity and democracy,\u201d the government said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Ukraine is not a member of NATO."
