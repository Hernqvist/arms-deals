  "text": "The U.S. State Department recently approved the potential sale to Finland of more than $800 million worth of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, Mk 41 vertical launch systems, and other associated items. Depending on how that country decides to proceed with its Squadron 2020 naval modernization program, some of those systems could go into a new class of ice-breaking multi-purpose corvettes, as well as end up on older ships as part of various planned upgrade projects. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. military\u2019s main foreign military sales office, announced the possible arms packages in three separate notices in February 2018. The announcements say that the 100 RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ Extended Range missiles, plus another dozen older RGM-84L-4s that Finland would upgrade to that standard itself using conversion kits, would arm its existing Hamina-class missile boats and shore-based coastal defense batteries. The 68 RIM-162s, also known as ESSMs, and the four Mk 41s would be part of the armament package on the four all-new corvettes the country is building under the Squadron 2020 plan.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that U.S. government approval does not mean a country has agreed to purchase the weapons or other systems in question. Finland is in the middle of a competition to select a new anti-ship missile to replace its existing Swedish-made RBS-15 Mk IIs and Boeing\u2019s Harpoon is just one potential option. The other contenders are the RBS-15 Mk III+ from Sweden\u2019s Saab Bofors Dynamics, the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from Norway\u2019s Kongsberg, and latest iteration of the European missile consortium MBDA\u2019s Exocet MM40. The same is true, perhaps even more so, with regards to Finland\u2019s future multi-purpose corvettes. The Finnish Ministry of Defense is pursuing a two-track plan to develop and purchase those ships, having hired the country\u2019s own Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) to craft the basic hullform in April 2017.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia The Finnish Hamina-class missile boat Tornio, which could receive Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of a ongoing upgrade program.\n\nIn 2018, Finland expects to award a separate contract for the systems that will go into those ships. Germany\u2019s Atlas Elektronik, the Canadian subsidiary of American firm Lockheed Martin, and Swedish defense contractor Saab are bidding on that deal. Atlas Elektronik and Saab both already supply systems for various Finnish Navy ships. How RMC defines the basic ship design and its capabilities is likely to have impact on whether or not the new corvettes will feature the Mk 41s, which can hold four ESSMs quad-packed in each launch cell. The Sylver vertical launch system from France's DCNS is another option, but would require Finland to also choose MDBA's Aster surface-to-air missile as the ship's primary air defense weapon. And though the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s plan does call for the new corvettes to have a robust local air defense capability, it won\u2019t necessary be the main focus for the engineers at RMC. \u201cIn the initial phase it was recognized that this type of new vessel with the required capabilities did not exist,\u201d according to an official primer on the Squadron 2020 project. \u201cThe vessels on the market were not capable of mine-laying and navigating in ice,\u201d it continues. \u201cFor a warship, the requirements arising from mine-laying and winter navigation are rare in the international context but they are essential for the Finnish Navy to fulfil its tasks.\u201d\n\nFinnish Ministry of Defense A rudimentary breakdown of the systems the Finnish Ministry of Defense wants on the new Squadron 2020 corvettes.\n\nFinland\u2019s shoreline is entirely along the Baltic Sea, much of which is frozen over or otherwise full of potentially dangerous ice floes during the winter. Some of the Finnish Navy\u2019s ships, such as its two aging H\u00e4meenmaa-class minelayers, do have a limited ice-breaking capability, but its smaller missile boats, such as the Hamina-class, have much more difficulty operating under those conditions. \u201cThe endurance and sea-going capabilities significantly limit the performance of the Hamina-class \u2026 in ice conditions and during rough sea,\u201d the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s guide to the Squadron 2020 program notes. On top of the ice, \u201cgale-force winds and the resulting wave heights restrict the operation of light naval units on the open sea. The significant wave height may reach six meters and more annually in the northern part of the Baltic Sea.\u201d The Baltic is already an extremely confined space without those environmental hazards and an all-weather ice-capable warship would be invaluable for the Finnish Navy. Finland isn\u2019t alone in recognizing the importance of having combat vessels that can operate in extreme cold weather conditions, either. Russia, Finland\u2019s most likely potential opponent in the region, is also developing ice-breaking anti-ship missile armed corvettes, though it will most likely deploy to support the country\u2019s expanding military operations the Arctic.\n\nPella Shipyard Russia An artist's rendering of Russia's future Project 23550 Ice-class missile armed, ice-capable corvette.\n\nIt\u2019s the constraints of the Baltic that also make maritime mine warfare particularly attractive in both offensive and defensive scenarios. This is again especially true with regards to Russia, which has significant naval assets based in St. Petersburg and elsewhere. Already historical antagonists, relations between the two countries have been steadily worsening in recent years, with Finland increasing its cooperation with the United States and other members of the NATO alliance and Russian officials threatening to retaliate economically and militarily in response. Finnish authorities already accuse Russian military aircraft of routinely and provocatively violating their airspace. In a naval engagement, Russian ships and submarines would have to transit through the Gulf of Finland \u2013 less than 100 miles across at its widest point \u2013 to get into the Baltic Sea proper and Finnish mines could easily constrain their movements. It could also limit the ability of naval reinforcements from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave to the south or elsewhere to rush into the area in a crisis. As such, minelaying is an extremely important capability for the Finns, who have various dedicated minelayers already in service. In addition, depth charge racks on its small missile boats, they can also deploy mines. The primary type in Finnish service is Patria\u2019s Sea Mine 2000, which reportedly has features that make it hard to detect and multiple sensors \u2013 possibly including acoustic, magnetic, and other types \u2013 to both detect potential targets and discriminate between them to focus on the most valuable ships in a task force.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia Patria's Sea Mine 2000."
