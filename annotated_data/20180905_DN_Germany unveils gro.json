  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 The German government has presented an ambitious plan for beefing up the country\u2019s armed forces over the next 10-plus years.\n\nThe strategy comes in the form of a new \u201ccapability profile,\u201d described by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as a \u201cgrand, comprehensive modernization concept.\u201d At its intermediate point, by 2024, it proposes Germany\u2019s annual defense budget at 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, or about \u20ac60 billion (U.S. $69 billion).\n\nThat would amount to a sizable increase for a country currently hovering around a GDP of \u20ac40 billion. But it would still fall short of the NATO-wide objective of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense.\n\nIn von der Leyen\u2019s telling, the new strategy would lift the armed forces from years of budget cutbacks and deprivation toward a set of capabilities deep enough to defend the homeland and simultaneously partake in out-of-area missions.\n\nIn the telling of critics, the strategy amounts to little more than wishful thinking because it assumes defense spending way above what is currently on the table.\n\nThe Social Democrats, which hold the reigns of the Finance Ministry in the current coalition government, previously rejected the type of stark budget boosts that the Defence Ministry believes is needed to plug longstanding shortfalls.\n\nGerman defense budget angers critics \u2014 including the defense minister Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Cabinet has approved a draft federal budget considered so insufficient for the armed forces by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that she submitted a formal note of protest along with her vote.\n\nAccording to a summary of the classified document released by the Defence Ministry, there are two priorities in the envisioned spending spree: soldier equipment and bringing the Bundeswehr up to speed in cyber capabilities.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Berlin is expected to provide a modernized \u201cbrigade-equivalent\u201d force package including air and naval components.\n\nIn accordance with another strategy document released last month, an updated concept of operations for the Bundeswehr, the new capability framework is built around the idea that there will be parity between the fundamental missions of defending Germany's territory and conducting overseas missions.\n\nWhile seeming trivial at first, that proclamation will have far-reaching, practical consequences on spending. Over the past years, defense leaders have routinely accepted shortfalls in home-station training to ensure troops in combat zones have the best possible equipment. Formally elevating the importance of homeland defense in the armed forces' planning means pumping new money into an area that officials say has been chronically underfunded.\n\nThe coming months will show how lawmakers, and especially those of the Social Democratic Party, will react to the proposal. Fritz Felgentreu, one of the party\u2019s leading voices on defense matters, told the Tagesschau website that the new strategy reads like a \u201cwell-thought-out wish list.\u201d He said he wants to see a \u201cconcrete analysis\u201d of exactly where additional money is needed."
