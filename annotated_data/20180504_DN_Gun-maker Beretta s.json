  "text": "ROME \u2015 Italian gun-maker Beretta is eyeing a new technology transfer deal with Argentina after concluding a similar deal with Qatar, claiming handing over technology to allow international customers to build their own guns is the future.\n\nThe firm is looking at transferring technology to Argentinian state manufacturer Fabricaciones Militares for the production of handguns and assault rifles, said Carlo Ferlito, vice president of Beretta Defense Technologies.\n\n\u201cThis will happen increasingly \u2014 it is key to penetrating markets,\u201d he said. \u201cAll customers want control of supply.\u201d\n\nBeretta is now looking at future deals to transfer technology to international clients in Africa and Asia, he said.\n\nIn March, Beretta signed with Qatar to create a joint venture based there with the country\u2019s Ministry of Defence to produce its ARX160 and ARX200 assault rifles, as well as its 92A1 pistol for Qatar government use.\n\nUnder the deal, Beretta will hold a minority stake in the joint venture, which will receive technology transfer from Beretta Holding Group and will build a manufacturing facility in Doha.\n\nFerlito did not reveal the order that was involved in the deal.\n\nThe Army handgun: A new poster child for acquisition malpractice? Companies want fairness, but they also want predictability. And excessive bureaucracy in the name of fair competition, where contracting officers treat all competitions with kid gloves in fear of getting reprimanded if something goes awry, is counterproductive.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThe first transfer of technology is complete, and Qatar will have total independence in six years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firm has previously struck a deal for partial technology transfer with Egypt for the local production of its Px4 pistol.\n\nTurning to the U.S. market, Ferlito said the firm was viewing pending competitions.\n\n\u201cEveryone talks about the next-generation squad assault weapon, and we are looking into the program,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have ideas about what we would offer. It will be challenging in terms of lethality, recoil reduction and weight.\u201d\n\nFerlito praised Beretta\u2019s M9 pistol, which was in service with the U.S. Army for three decades before being replaced last year by the Sig Sauer XM17 Modular Handgun System.\n\nTake a look at the Corps' new Sig Sauer handguns It's everything you need to know about the 9mm hand guns by Sig Sauer. (Daniel Woolfolk/Staff)\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of confusion about the M9,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was criticized for its ammunition, not the gun itself. We proved that to the customer, and we are still delivering to the U.S. Army on the previous contracts, and we are passing tests showing it is incredibly reliable.\u201d\n\nFerlito said the M9 era was not over. \u201cIt has [a] lot to say, and the latest modifications make it very interesting for a lot of armies around the world. Having said that, this is the year of polymer, and the customer wants polymer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. chose the cheapest option, not the best performing option, because they chose to stop the tests before their completion because of the offer they received,\u201d he said."
