Markings on these boxes revealed their contents as 60mm mortar shells produced in the state-owned Serbian factory Krusik in 2012.\n\nKrusik said it had sold that particular lot to Zastava, another Serbian state-owned arms factory.\n\nRead more:\n\nUK Missed Chance to Stop Suspect Bosnian Bullet Deal\n\nMaking a Killing: The 1.2 Billion Euro Arms Pipeline to Middle East\n\nBalkan Arms Trade"
