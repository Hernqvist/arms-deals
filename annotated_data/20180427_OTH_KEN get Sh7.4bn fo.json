PHOTO | FILE\n\nBy NEVILLE OTUKI\n\nMore by this Author Summary Treasury secretary Henry Rotich made the top-ups through a mini-budget that is awaiting Parliament approval.\n\nThe KDF had recently gone slow on acquisition of weapons as neighbouring Uganda made a strong comeback to lead in East Africa\u2019s arms race.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) last month revealed that Kenya slashed its spending on military hardware by half to Sh1.3 billion ($13 million) in 2017 from Sh2.8 the previous year.\n\nThe military has been added Sh9 billion for weapons acquisition, positioning the Kenyan army for a bullish entry into the global arms market following a lull that saw Uganda overtake it in arsenal spending last year.\n\nTreasury secretary Henry Rotich made the top-ups through a mini-budget that is awaiting Parliament approval.\n\nOf the Sh9 billion army cash, Sh7.4 billion will be for arms stockpiles and the remaining Sh1.6 billion for personnel emoluments in the period to June 30, as the current financial year comes to an end.\n\nMr Rotich last September also sought MPs\u2019 approval for budget top-ups by Sh1.8 billion for the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), coinciding with the period when the country was gripped by a prolonged election.\n\nREAD: Uganda tops arms race as Kenya halves to Sh1.3bn\n\nALSO READ: US gives Kenya six boats to help boost war on terrorism\n\nMORE: Court gives auditor-general free hand to audit military spending\n\nStrong comeback\n\nThe KDF had recently gone slow on acquisition of weapons as neighbouring Uganda made a strong comeback to lead in East Africa\u2019s arms race.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) last month revealed that Kenya slashed its spending on military hardware by half to Sh1.3 billion ($13 million) in 2017 from Sh2.8 the previous year.\n\nUganda on the other hand ended its lull with its last year\u2019s arms stockpile worth Sh1.8 billion, a departure from 2016 when it made nil purchase. In 2017, Tanzania did not make any purchase.\n\nTanzania\u2019s non-action in the global arms market came amid austerity plan by President John Magufuli who is pushing for cuts in expenditure deemed non-essential.\n\nNairobi\u2019s arms orders last year included a second-hand naval gun, AK-630 30mm, from Montenegro \u201cfor modernisation of Jasiri OPV (offshore patrol vessel),\u201d the Sipri report says."
