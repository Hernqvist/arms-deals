  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Combined weapon sales from American companies for fiscal 2018 were up 13 percent over fiscal 2017 figures, netting American firms $192.3 billion, according to new numbers released Thursday by the State Department.\n\nThe department previously announced that FY18 brought in $55.66 billion in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over FY17\u2019s $41.93 billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry.\n\nWhat had not been released until now is the total direct commercial sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy systems from industry. Those figures topped $136.6 billion for FY18, a 6.6 percent increase from FY17\u2019s $128.1 billion.\n\nThe Trump administration has made selling American defense goods abroad a key plank of its governance plan, under the guiding principal that \u201ceconomic security is national security.\u201d Earlier this year, the department rolled out its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy, or CAT, as well as new guidance for selling unmanned systems, with the explicit goal of increasing arms sales.\n\nState official predicts US weapon sales increase in 2019 U.S. firms could be poised for a bonanza of weapon sales in FY 2019.\n\nHowever, tying this year\u2019s figures to the CAT changes may be a stretch. Sales can fluctuate year by year because of the size of certain weapons packages; a pair of large Saudi Arabian purchases in 2012 famously set that year up for a massive $287 billion annual total.\n\nAnd there has already been steady growth each of the last three years, even before the Trump administration\u2019s reforms kicked in, with $148.6 billion in total sales in FY16; $170 billion in FY17; and $192.2 billion in FY18.\n\nA State Department official, speaking on background ahead of the official release of these figures, acknowledged to Defense News that these figures can\u2019t be tied directly to changes in policy, noting they represent a \u201cdynamic picture\u201d and that the department is aware there are some factors \u201cwe do not control.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

How much, however, is hard to nail down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on a particular goal that we\u2019re looking at\u201d for FY19, the official said. \u201cWe think a 13 percent increase is a significant increase year over year. We\u2019d like to maintain that pace, but there are other factors that go into a given set of annual numbers, so I\u2019m hesitant to give a target goal.\u201d\n\nThanks to both the CAT changes and export reform efforts beginning under the Obama administration, there are more options for countries to use direct commercial sales, or DCS, for their procurements.\n\nAsked if that meant DCS might grow as FMS cases drop, the official said that is \u201cone dynamic\u201d under review, but noted that \u201cas certain systems start going through DCS, you\u2019ll have new systems backfilling the FMS queue.\u201d"
