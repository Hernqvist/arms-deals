  "text": "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) \u2014 The proposed 2019 budget for the Department of National Defense (DND) is \u20b1251 billion, \u20b149 billion higher than their current budget.\n\n\u20b1183 billion was allocated to personnel services \u2014 to increase the compensation for civilian and military personnel, as well as to provide for a pension increase for retirees.\n\n\"'Yun pong increase namin malaki, ito po 'yung dagdag sa second tranche ng ating increases for personal services. Kaya po malaki,\" DND Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said during House Appropriations Committee deliberations Wednesday.\n\n[Translation: Our increase is huge. This is the addition to the second tranche of increases for personal services, and that's why it's huge]\n\nThis \u20b147 billion hike is in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's directive in January to increase the salaries of military and police personnel, one of his campaign promises in 2016.\n\nThe hike comes despite a cut in the budget of other government agencies, such as the Department of Education. Its proposed funds were cut by \u20b151 billion, from over \u20b1580 billion in 2018 to \u20b1528 billion in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) seeks a 30 percent increase in their 2019 budget, with the bulk of it going to the Philippine National Police.\n\n'Martial law is working'\n\nLawmakers and defense officials also discussed martial law in Mindanao.\n\n\"Martial law is working in Mindanao. Although there are some pockets of trouble there like the groups of Maute, BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters) and Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Sulu. It is working in other fronts,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed getting good feedback from Mindanao citizens.\n\n\"In fact we get feedback kung pwede raw tuluy-tuloy na [it should not stop],\" he added.\n\nLorenzana had earlier said he is open to further extending military rule in Mindanao, beyond the two extensions Congress granted in 2017.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief-of-Staff Carlito Galvez wants continuous vigilance in the region, as the ISIS-inspired Maute group responsible for the five-month Marawi City crisis is still actively recruiting members.\n\n\"Nakita po namin talaga na ang ating greatest threat would be the ISIS-Maute group. Considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS talagang evident,\" Galvez said.\n\n[Translation: We saw that our greatest threat is the ISIS-Maute group, considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS, it's evident.]\n\nThe AFP Chief also said they can defeat the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) rebels in Mindanao as reflected in the number of surrendering insurgents.\n\n\"We are estimating that in two or three years time, we will defeat the CPP near in the near future,\" he added.\n\nGalvez also affirmed Lorenzana, saying Martial law helps in improving the state of security in the Mindanao.\n\nHe said from January this year, the military was able to neutralize 800 communist rebels, and confiscate 5, 504 high-powered firearms from a number of anti-terrorism operations.\n\nHe added, about 200 members of local terrorist groups have also surrendered"
