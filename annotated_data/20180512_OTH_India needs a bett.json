  "text": "Author: Abhijit Singh, Observer Research Foundation\n\nAt a recent press conference in New Delhi, India\u2019s Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman surprised reporters by stating that she saw \u2018no tension between the navies of India and China in the Indian Ocean\u2019. In response to a question about a perceived \u2018tussle\u2019 for supremacy in the Indian Ocean, Sitharaman downplayed the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) threat in India\u2019s near-seas, choosing curiously not to elaborate on the matter.\n\nNot everyone in India\u2019s security circles would agree with the Minister\u2019s assessment. Over the past few years, China\u2019s rapidly expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean has created anxiety in India\u2019s strategic community, where many believe China\u2019s naval activism has shrunk New Delhi\u2019s space for operational manoeuvre. Not only has China made inroads into India\u2019s traditional sphere of influence in maritime South Asia; Beijing has also leveraged its naval anti-piracy deployments for geopolitical gains by promoting partnerships with regional states and advancing a \u2018benevolent China\u2019 narrative.\n\nMore importantly, Beijing has raised its strategic stakes in the Indian Ocean. It is odd that China\u2019s anti-piracy contingents now comprise guided-missile frigates, advanced destroyers and special operations forces \u2014contingents suited more for high-impact \u2018presence operations\u2019 than anti-piracy missions. Since the inauguration of China\u2019s first overseas military facility in Djibouti, the PLAN\u2019s bid for strategic access in the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical littorals has been amply evident.\n\nFor New Delhi, the bigger challenge has come from Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean. In recent years, Chinese anti-piracy contingents have invariably been accompanied by a PLAN submarine. In the name of counter-piracy operations, Chinese submarines have gathered critical information about the Indian Ocean\u2019s operating environment and have spent an inordinately long time scouring the South Asian seas. The PLAN has been assisted in its endeavours by the Pakistan Navy, raising further concerns in India about an evolving China\u2013Pakistan axis in the Indian Ocean. China\u2019s reported deployment of a submarine in July 2017, at the height of the month-long stand-off between the Indian Army and the People\u2019s Liberation Army in the Doklam plateau, so upset New Delhi that India\u2019s naval leadership felt compelled to order permanent surveillance of the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical sea lanes and choke points by \u2018mission-ready\u2019 warships.\n\nIn its attempts to maintain a favourable balance of naval power in the Indian Ocean, New Delhi has drawn close to Washington and Tokyo. The trilateral India\u2013US\u2013Japan Malabar exercises have grown in scope and complexity with the addition of more combat drills, but New Delhi has been strangely reluctant to expand the tent to accommodate the Royal Australian Navy. It is possible India might consider entering into other trilateral arrangements (possibly with France and Australia) before assenting to a large naval coalition in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTo New Delhi\u2019s credit, it has stepped up its game in the Western Indian Ocean \u2014 the focal point of China\u2019s investment and infrastructure initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region. After signing logistical pacts with Oman and France, India has strengthened maritime ties with Mauritius, Seychelles, Mozambique and Madagascar. A visit by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to East African island states in April 2018 demonstrated New Delhi\u2019s resolve to rise to the challenge posed by China in the Western Indian Ocean littoral.\n\nMeanwhile, there are indications that Beijing may have been less than straightforward about its Belt and Road Initiative. The developmental blueprint is inherently \u2018dual-use\u2019 in character: Chinese-constructed commercial facilities are often structurally upgradable for military use (as witnessed in October 2014 when a PLAN submarine docked at a Chinese-constructed facility in Colombo), and the terms of agreement for port operations are almost always skewed in favour of Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nNew Delhi knows China is being smart with its influence projection in the Indian Ocean. Beijing has ensured that its warships do not threaten Indian interests in the Indian Ocean. PLAN ships have not challenged India\u2019s sovereignty in its territorial waters and have maintained a safe distance from the Andaman and Nicobar islands. China has limited its ventures to its Belt and Road Initiative partner states, who are eager to benefit from Beijing\u2019s economic and military assistance.\n\nYet there is no escaping the sense in New Delhi of a \u2018slow choke\u2019 of Indian equities in the Indian Ocean. In order to manage the India\u2013China rivalry at sea, some analysts have proposed an \u2018incidents at sea\u2019 agreement with objectives similar to the US\u2013USSR \u2018INCSEA\u2019 pact of 1972. While such an arrangement could indeed de-escalate a crisis arising from an accidental encounter at sea, it is not entirely clear how it would help in clarifying suspicions about strategic intent. The Indian Navy would be happy to sign up to a \u2018code of conduct\u2019 if it were to also apply in the Western Pacific, where there is an equal possibility of an India\u2013China skirmish. But that, presumably, will not be acceptable to China.\n\nAs things stand, the Indian Navy is intent on emphasising its pre-eminent status in the Indian Ocean. Even so, the task of constantly patrolling the South Asian seas is imposing a heavy burden on naval frontline assets. The sheer magnitude of the task has led Admiral Sunil Lanba, head of the Indian Navy, to observe that even though Indian warships were monitoring the pattern and periodicity of extra-regional deployments, it is clear the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy is here to stay in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is possible the Admiral was acknowledging the putative India\u2013China \u2018reset\u2019 in bilateral relations and the attendant need for cooperative engagement with the PLAN. Or maybe he was subtly cautioning his subordinates that they needed to do more to counter the China threat in India\u2019s strategic backyard.\n\nAbhijit Singh is Senior Fellow and Head of the Maritime Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi."
