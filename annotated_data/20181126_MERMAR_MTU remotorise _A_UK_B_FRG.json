  "text": "Rolls-Royce is to supply 18 MTU Series 4000 diesel generator sets to BAE Systems as part of the Power Improvement Project (PIP) to increase the resilience of the power and propulsion system in all six Type 45 destroyers. The two existing diesel gensets are to be replaced by three MTU gensets per vessel. The three MTU gensets will complement two existing Rolls-Royce WR21 gas turbines also supplying power to the electric propulsion system. Knut M\u00fcller, Head of MTU\u2019s Marine & Government Business, said: \u201cWe are delighted to have convinced our partners BAE Systems and the Royal Navy once again of the outstanding merits of our Series 4000 gensets and engines. I am convinced the Royal Navy will benefit from this long-term \u2013 also thanks to the simplified logistics when it comes to maintaining our engines.\u201d Jon Pearson, Warship Support Director, BAE Systems, said: \u201cPIP is set to deliver a significant improvement in the performance and reliability of the Type 45 destroyers. It will be carried out by Cammell Laird and BMT, led by BAE Systems and relying on the excellence of our supply chain partners such as MTU and RollsRoyce to deliver a high quality, timely and cost effective solution for the Royal Navy.\u201d\n\nCommuniqu\u00e9 de Rolls-Royce, novembre 2018"
