  "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to make it easier to sell small arms abroad.\n\nThe State department has submitted a request to shift oversight on small-arms exports, such as semiautomatic rifles, from State to Commerce, kicking off a 45-day review period of the new policy, which has been long sought by the gun industry.\n\nThe move impacts any firearms that are \u201cwidely available\u201d in U.S. stores for commercial sale. However, State would maintain oversight on any weapons sold primarily for military use.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that arms manufacturers have sought for years, with hopes of selling more weapons abroad \u2013 one that aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s stance that economic security and national security are irrevocably linked.\n\nDo new Trump arms export rules live up to the hype? The Trump administration has a new conventional arms export policy, but it is unclear what has actually changed.\n\nBut while the Trump administration is pushing forward the policy, discussion about moving such weapons to Commerce has been underway for years as part of the Obama administration\u2019s export reform efforts. Under that umbrella, the State department went through the various categories of export rules and looked to move as much as possible over to Commerce, in order to encourage exports and free up State regulators to spend more time on large defense items.\n\n\u201cThese changes will significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition industry, promote American exports, and clarify the regulatory requirements for independent gunsmiths, while at the same time prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related issues may be of concern,\u201d a State department spokesman told Defense News on background.\n\nDuring the 45-day comment period, arms control groups are expected to object over fears such weapons may be used against civilian populations. While State continues to have oversight on military-grade weapons, sales of semiautomatic weapons for police forces would now be outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

In a May 15 statement, he warned that \u201cweakened Congressional oversight of international small arms and munitions sales is extremely hazardous to global security.\u201d"
