This is a sharp increase from the Sh17.5 billion ($175 million) spent on the same in the current financial year.\n\nKenya\u2019s heavy military spending is hinged on the need to defend its territory against the Somali-based Al-Shabaab terrorists who have in the past targeted civilians and security forces in major towns.\n\nHowever, there are fears that Kenya\u2019s fat military budget may trigger an arms race in the region with Uganda already increasing its arsenal spending. Kenya has in the last five years continued to lead its regional neighbours both in budget size as well as annual spending growth, causing discomfort among its peers.\n\nAlso read: US donates 6 Metal Shark boats to the Kenyan Navy to help fight terrorism\n\nUganda's President Ywoeri Museveni inspects military equipment used by UPDF solders undertaking the mountain warfare.
