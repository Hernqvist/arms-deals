  "text": "TEL AVIV: As the US tightens its terms for financing the Israeli military, one of America\u2019s closest allies is beginning to sell its weapons to the US, instead of the other way around.\n\nMPR 500 Bombs\n\nJust last week, US-based Orbital ATK and Israel\u2019s IMI Systems announced a teaming agreement to supply a version of IMI\u2019s 500-lb Multi-Purpose Rigid Bomb (MPR 500) family of munitions for the US Air Force.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this relationship will lead to future product enhancements and additional opportunities for Orbital ATK and IMI Systems to collaborate,\u201d said Pat Nolan, vice president and general manager of missile products at Orbital\u2019s Defense Systems Group.\n\nThe MPR-500 is used on several different Israeli fighter aircraft. In conjunction with GPS or laser guidance, it\u2019s designed to improve strikes in dense urban environments and in close proximity to friendly forces, while reducing collateral damage and risk to non-combatants. The new bomb is designed to penetrate multiple floors and detonate its fragmenting high-explosive warhead inside buildings, destroying hidden targets. That allows planners to target a specific floor, while leaving the rest of a building relatively safe.\n\nIMI says that the weapon maintains its structural integrity throughout its path; eliminating breakup or jittering that has often been encountered with standard GP bombs, which increases the risk of duds or collateral damage. IMI claims that MPR-500 offers over 90 percent reliability operating against such hard targets.\n\nIron Dome & Tamir\n\nA letter signed by 40 Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives urged appropriators to consider purchasing the Israeli Iron Dome rocket interceptor for American use. In Israel, Iron Dome intercepts incoming rockets, artillery, and mortar shells aimed mainly at civilian targets; since the US homeland isn\u2019t in range of such tactical weapons, an American Iron Dome would primarily protect frontline forces and forward bases.\n\nFor these missions, however, the US Army seems committed to its own Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC). However, the Army has test-fired the Iron Dome\u2019s Tamir interceptor from IPFC\u2019s Multi-Mission Launcher (MML), which is designed to fire a wide array of different interceptors. (See video above.) Raytheon has teamed with Rafael to build the Tamir, which kills incoming threats launched from ranges of up to 70 km.\n\nIron Dome has a remarkable track record: It\u2019s the world\u2019s most used missile defense system, intercepting more than 1,500 targets with a greater than 90 percent success rate since being fielded in 2011. I can say from my own experience that, during the Protective Edge operation in Gaza in 2015, when rockets were launched into Israel, it was very comforting to hear the sound of a Hamas rocket exploding overhead after being hit by Iron Dome.\n\nThe system is effective day or night and in all weather conditions, including low clouds, rain, dust storms and fog. It features a first-of-its-kind multi-mission launcher, which is designed to fire a variety of interceptor missiles, depending on the threat \u2014 similar to the American MML still in development.\n\nRafael is now completing development of the C-Dome, a naval system derived from the Iron Dome designed to protect ships from all aerial threats. C-Dome handles saturation attacks by engaging multiple incoming threat simultaneously. C-Dome components include a multi-round launcher assembly loaded with vertically-launched canistered interceptors, installed under the ship\u2019s deck.\n\nWill Rafael offer C-Dome to the U.S military? \u201cIf Raytheon makes this version a locally-made system, this option looks very realistic,\u201d a Ministry of Defense source tells Breaking Defense. Rafael refused to comment.\n\nEitan Armored Personnel Carrier\n\nSources in the Israeli Defense Ministry point to the Israeli-developed Eitan eight-wheel drive armored personnel carrier (APC) as another candidate. Israel recently approved the production of hundreds of the Eitan APCs.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said after the Eitan was approved that it would dramatically improve Israeli capabilities within a decade, equipping IDF ground forces with hundreds of armored APCs with capabilities including an Active Protection System (APS) to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.\n\nIn fact, Brig. Gen. Guy Paglin, head of the Defense Ministry\u2019s tank and APC directorate, said that the Eitan will be the world\u2019s best protected armored vehicle: \u201cIt will have excellent combat capabilities that were tested in the past year in all the combat (sectors), from north to south.\u201d\n\nThe Eitan is the first wheeled 8\u00d78 APC developed in Israel, with the prototype first publicly unveiled in 2016. The IDF plans to gradually replace its very old tracked M113 APCs with a new armored vehicle. A prototype of the Eitan was first publicly unveiled in 2016.\n\nThe Eitan will be fitted with Rafael\u2019s Trophy APS, and Israeli sources tell Breaking Defense that other weapon systems will also be mounted on the wheeled APC. Sources in the Defense Ministry say that it will make sense to transfer production to the U.S .\n\nWill this open the U.S market for a version of this advanced APC? A Ministry of Defense source, asked about this, smiled and said: \u201cProduction in the U.S of an Israeli system is a different opera.\u201d Currently the US Army is doubling down on its investment in a different 8\u00d78 APC, the US-built Stryker, itself a variant of the widely sold Swiss MOWAG Piranha. The Strykers are slated to get bigger guns, upgraded underbody armor, and US-built active protection systems. For its part, the IDF had tested the Stryker but decided that it did not meet its requirements.\n\nCould a variant of Eitan be built in the US? Already, many components of two Israeli tracked vehicles, the Merkava 4 Main Battle Tank and the Namer heavy APC, are made in the US. In fact, some 60 percent of the Namer is made in the US, including the chassis. General Dynamics is the lead US contractor, but dozens more US companies are also involved in the program. In the case of the Eitan APC, involvement by US industry is expected to be even greater than in the Namer project.\n\nSo when the amount of local currency available from US grants will limit the production of the Eitan in Israel, transferring the production to the U.S is an idea that is in the air in all relevant parties.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9eF22kVN46g?t=8s\n\nHero-30 & Hero-400EC Loitering Weapon\n\nThree years ago, Raytheon teamed with Israeli company Uvision in an attempt to get orders to supply the Israeli-developed Hero-30 loitering weapon system \u2014 essentially, a kamikaze drone \u2014 to the U.S Army, under the Army\u2019s Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile Systems (LMAMS) . The tender is aimed at the purchase of 25,000 loitering weapon systems over 15 years. If the Hero-30 is selected, Raytheon will serve as the main contractor, according to the contract.\n\nUvision also has a larger version of the loitering weapons system, the Hero 400 EC, unveiled last year. This variant has a unique cruciform aerodynamic design which, according to the Israeli company, delivers high-accuracy and reduces collateral damage.\n\nUvision says that the Hero 400 EC\u2019s electric motor enables it to loiter silently above a target, ready to instantly respond to threats. According to Noam Levitt, UVision\u2019s CEO, the system was developed to answer a growing requirement for a loitering weapons system that can remain in the air for extended periods, provide a substantial warhead effective against a wide variety of targets, and deliver missile-level pinpoint strike capabilities. Will that version also be evaluated by the U.S armed forces? Uvision refused to answer questions about this option.\n\nTrophy and Iron Fist Active Protection Systems\n\nOne system the US Army is already buying: Rafael\u2019s Trophy Active Protection System, which shoots down incoming anti-tank weapons before they impact. Trophy is the only battle-tested APS in the Western world, though Russia has used its own APS to great effect in Ukraine. The IDF has installed Trophy on its Merkava heavy tanks and now the US is buying four brigades\u2019 worth for its M1 Abrams, with Chief of Staff Mark Milley pledging to eventually equip all armored brigades.\n\nMeanwhile the US is testing a rival Israeli APS, IMI\u2019s Iron Fist, on its M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Installing APS on a Bradley is harder than on a tank, because the Bradley\u2019s electrical system has less available power \u2014 crews in Iraq often had to shut down some systems before turning others on \u2014 and the vehicle\u2019s capacity to take more weight is lower as well. But if Iron Fist passes US testing, which is not a foregone conclusion, it will probably equip the Bradleys in the same four brigades whose tanks are getting Trophy, and possibly many more units as well.\n\n\u201cThe intent is to outfit the entire heavy force, all of our vehicles, all the ground vehicles \u2014 the Bradleys, the tanks, any future combat vehicles \u2014 with active protective systems,\u201d Gen. Milley told the Senate. \u201cActive protection systems are manufactured only in\u2026three (countries) right now. (One is) Russia, which we\u2019re not going to get them from. (The others are) Israel and the United States, and the companies in the United States, they\u2019re not ready yet for full rate production.\u201d That could mean big business for Israeli firms.\n\nSydney Freedberg contributed to this article."
