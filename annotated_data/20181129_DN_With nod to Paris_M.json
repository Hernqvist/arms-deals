  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Missile-maker MBDA is banking on a new European Union project to help boost wider adoption of its Missile Moyenne Port\u00e9e anti-tank weapon on the continent.\n\nThe confidence by executives stems from last week\u2019s European Council approval of a Beyond-Line-of-Sight Land Battlefield Missile System. The project is one of 34 efforts under the union\u2019s new Permanent Structured Cooperation scheme, or PESCO. The framework is meant to unify military capabilities of the member nations with an eye toward establishing the EU as a military player on the world stage.\n\nThe new missile project offers an glimpse into PESCO\u2019s nascent process for turning political ambitions into actual hardware made by national vendors. Such is the case here, says MBDA, which released a statement saying its MMP anti-tank weapon had been \u201cendorsed\u201d by the EU even though the official, one-paragraph project description makes no mention of a specific weapon.\n\nFrom cyber to military mobility: EU members endorse new defense objectives EU member states adopt 17 new cooperative projects under the fledgling PESCO pact, an initiative meant to sharpen Europe's military edge.\n\nCompany executives told Defense News that the MMP is what defense officials in France \u2014 which has the project lead together with Belgium and Cyprus \u2014 had in mind from the start when offering the project under an EU umbrella.\n\nThe weapon, they argue, is the natural choice because it is already in service with French forces and because it is the sole wholly European option available. (MBDA is a joint venture of Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo.)\n\nA spokeswoman for the French delegation to the EU in Brussels did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guided MMP, which boasts a range of 4 kilometers, can be fired by dismounted soldiers or from vehicles. Its competitors include the American-made Javelin and variants of the Spike, designed by Israel\u2019s Rafael. The Israelis market their offering through the Germany-based company Eurospike, and the missiles are produced in that country.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nBut MBDA argues the \u201cdesign authority\u201d for both competitors lies outside of Europe, which means the joint venture would be ineligible for a role \u2014 and funding \u2014 under PESCO or its associated funding stream, the proposed \u20ac13 billion (U.S. $15 billion) European Defence Fund.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the apparent PESCO blessing can help propel the MMP weapon to greater popularity in European armies. There is already lower-hanging fruit included in the partnership with project co-sponsor Belgium: Brussels plans to buy a new fleet of armored combat vehicles from France\u2019s Nexter, a portion of which stands to be equipped with an anti-tank weapon.\n\nThat\u2019s where EU funding support could come into play. Players of any PESCO project can get EU co-financing for the modification work required to make one weapon interoperable for several partner forces.\n\nOn paper, the EU missile project has ambitious goals. The weapon eventually chosen \u2014 presumably the MMP \u2014 \u201cis intended to be integrated on an extensive variety of platforms,\u201d a PESCO project overview states. \u201cThe project includes joint training and formation aspects. A dedicated \u2018users club\u2019 is envisioned develop a common European doctrine on BLOS firing.\u201d\n\nIndustry officials expect an initial kickoff meeting of the partner nations to hammer out a way ahead, though the timing is unclear. At that point, there could be a formal commitment to the MMP weapon."
