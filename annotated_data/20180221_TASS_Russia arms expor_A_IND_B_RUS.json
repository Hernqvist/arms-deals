Russia has delivered weapons worth more than $2.5 billion to Indonesia over the past 25 years, the press office of the state arms seller Rosoboronexport said on Wednesday.\n\nThe year 2018 will mark 60 years since the first Soviet arms deliveries to Indonesia: in 1958 the Soviet Union delivered 100 GAZ-69 military cross-country vehicles to Indonesia, he added.\n\nIt was reported earlier that Jakarta wanted to buy 10 Su-35 multirole fighters to replace outdated US F-5 Tiger aircraft that had been in operation in the Indonesian army since 1980. Later, Russia\u2019s hi-tech corporation Rostec reported that Indonesia had received a commercial offer for 11 Su-35 planes.\n\nThe Su-35 is a Russian-made multipurpose generation 4++ super-maneuverable fighter jet equipped with a phased array radar and steerable thrusters. It can develop a speed of up to 2,500 kilometers per hour and has a flying range of 3,400 kilometers and a combat radius close to 1,600 kilometers.
