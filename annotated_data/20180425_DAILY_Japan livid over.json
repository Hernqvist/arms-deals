  "text": "A dessert dish that South Korea plans to serve at Friday\u2019s summit with the North has enraged Japan, which is demanding the \u201cdistasteful offering\u201d not be served.\n\nThe mango mousse \u2013 dubbed \u201cSpring of the People\u201d in a publicity photograph \u2014 depicts the small islands known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in Korea \u2014 islets whose sovereignty is disputed by Tokyo. They lie in the Sea of Japan, which Seoul refers to as the East Sea.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely regrettable,\u201d a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Wednesday, adding that Japan had lodged a protest about the distasteful offering, according to Reuters. \u201cWe have asked that the dessert not be served.\u201d\n\nJapan complained to South Korea about fans waving a flag with a similar design at a recent friendly women\u2019s ice hockey game at the Winter Paralympics between the combined Koreas team and Sweden.\n\nThe bitter controversy comes as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in prepare to meet to discuss Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program on Friday.\n\nRelations between the Koreas and Japan have long been strained by territorial disputes and simmering resentment over Japanese colonization of the Korean peninsula in the first half of last century.\n\nTokyo has also protested against the erection of statues commemorating Korean women and girls forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War II.\n\nSeoul says that Tokyo has yet to apologize for its wartime actions.\n\nBut Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have vowed to present a united front and exert pressure on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nThe North-South summit in the village of Panmunjom is expected to be followed by a meeting between Kim and President Trump in May or June."
