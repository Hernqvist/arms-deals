  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 France\u2019s Nexter and Belgium\u2019s CMI Defence have signed a cooperation pact to revamp the Belgian army\u2019s fleet of ground combat vehicles, the companies announced.\n\nThe deal follows an intergovernmental agreement between Paris and Brussels aimed at letting Belgium in on the French land program for \u201cmotorized capabilities,\u201d known as CaMo in France. Nexter is the lead for that program for the French Armed Forces, which is part of the larger Scorpion land warfare modernization effort.\n\nAll told, Belgium is looking to buy 382 Griffon multirole armored vehicles and 60 Jaguar armored reconnaissance and combat vehicles. According to a CMI Defence statement, the \u201cindustrial mastery of work\u201d will come from Nexter.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, CMI Defence would be the \u201cfinal assembler\u201d for the Griffon vehicles and act in a similar capacity for putting a 40mm turret onto the Jaguars, according to Nexter.\n\nDeliveries to the Belgian army will stretch from 2025 to 2030.\n\nUS Army test-fires Belgian-made gun amid plans for Stryker upgrade competition The U.S. Army\u2019s test-firing of a 30mm gun turret from CMI Defence is seen by the Belgian firm as putting it in a privileged position.\n\nThe vehicles used by both countries are meant to be virtually identical, thus boosting the potential for interoperability during operations.\n\n\u201cOur cooperation with Nexter is a good example of how European defense companies can jointly participate in the establishment of the Europe of Defense,\u201d CMI Defence president Thierry Renaudin was quoted as saying in a statement.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
