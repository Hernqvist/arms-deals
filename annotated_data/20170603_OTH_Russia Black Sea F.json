The cutting-edge frigates are also capable of carrying a Ka-27 or Ka-31 helicopter and can reach speeds of up to 30 knots (55kph).\n\nThe Russian Navy\u2019s task group operates in the eastern Mediterranean since 2012 and has seen a number of rotations, with reinforcements coming from different fleets.\n\nLast November, the group reached its peak in terms of combat capabilities when the Russian aircraft carrier \u2018Admiral Kuznetsov\u2019 arrived in the region after a weeks-long journey from its Northern Fleet\u2019s base to the Mediterranean waters.\n\nThe \u2018Kuznetsov\u2019, the Russian Navy\u2019s sole aircraft carrier, was escorted by the heavy missile cruiser \u2018Pyotr Veliky\u2019 (Peter the Great), the largest ship of her class in the world.\n\nThe naval group is taking an active part in combating Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Syria. On Wednesday, the \u2018Admiral Essen\u2019 and submarine \u2018Krasnodar\u2019 fired four Kalibr missiles, targeting IS positions near Palmyra.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian frigate & submarine fire 4 cruise missiles at ISIS targets near Palmyra \u2013 MoD\n\nThroughout 2016, the navy conducted numerous missile launches, destroying the terrorists\u2019 manpower and materiel. In 2015, four Caspian Sea Fleet corvettes fired 26 cruise missiles on IS targets in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces.\n\nThe most spectacular launch so far involved negotiations with Iran and Iraq as the missiles had to travel through those countries\u2019 airspaces, covering 1,500km (932 miles) before hitting their targets."
