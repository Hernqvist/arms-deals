But on Jan. 10 as she approached her home port of Bandar Anzali, waves and high winds forced her into a rocky jetty protecting the harbor.\n\nTwo sailors died in the accident. In the weeks after, the Iranian military stripped Damavand of equipment as she broke apart on the rocks. By Jan. 28, the frigate had sank.\n\nDamavand was the second of three built and seven total planned Moudge-class frigates, which trace their design to the preceding Alvand class, built for the Shah by the United Kingdom as the Vosper in the 1960s.\n\nThe 310-foot-long, 1,500-ton Damavand launched onto the Caspian in 2013 from Bandar Anzali. To underscore Damavand\u2018s symbolic importance, then-Pres. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended the launching ceremony with the Iranian defense minister and the armed forces chief of staff.\n\n?\u062a\u0635\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0648 #\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0632\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u064a \u0645\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0648\u062a\u060c \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u063a\u0631\u0642 \u0634\u062f\u0646.\n\n\u062f\u0631 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0643\u0633\u060c \u062e\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u0628\u062f\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u062a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a. pic.twitter.com/d3pryWSOLV \u2014 Mahdi Bakhtiari (@Mahdiibakhtiari) January 28, 2018\n\nIranian state media described the ship as carrying four Qader anti-ship cruise missiles, each with a range of more than 200 kilometers, along with a 76-millimeter Fajr-27 gun, and several smaller cannons, an anti-aircraft gun, two anti-air missiles and torpedoes.\n\nOne of the most important pieces of tech was an onboard phased array radar \u2014 allowing the warship to see and track dozens of targets.

Azerbaijan has bought Israeli anti-ship missiles, and Kazakhstan is starting to build a navy of its own, although it is small \u2014 three domestically-produced Kazakhstan-class missile boats and 20 patrol boats as of 2016.\n\nIt would be tough to call this build-up an arms race, given the size.\n\nHowever, the region\u2019s armed forces take the possibility of a conflict seriously enough to use it as a basis for military exercises, such as a 2012 exercise between Russia and Kazakhstan simulating an Iranian attack across the Arabogazk\u00f6l Aylagy, a shallow depression in Turkmenistan adjacent to the Caspian Sea and the Kazakh border.\n\nA 2012 Russian military map simulating an Iranian attack across the Arabogazk\u00f6l Aylagy. Photo via Russian Internet\n\nThe Caspian is also a highway for Russian power, and Russia\u2019s Caspian Flotilla is the single largest armed force on the sea. As the world watched in surprise in 2015, Russian corvettes launched long-range Kalibr cruise missiles from the sea to targets in Syria \u2014 some 1,000 miles away \u2014 in an example of how the Caspian serves as \u201cstrategic depth,\u201d a military term for the space a combatant can exploit beyond its core territories.\n\nIran has hedged its modest military build-up with naval diplomacy, sending ships on port visits across the sea. Iran has also participated in joint military exercises in the Caspian with Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.\n\nDamavand was a key part of this strategy, as she \u2014 festooned in a banner displaying the image of the Ayatollah \u2014 docked in the Kazakh port of Aktau in April 2017 along with the corvette Paykan. \u201cThe Iranian Navy\u2019s flotilla \u2026 is slated to convey Iran\u2019s message of peace and friendship to Kazakhstan,\u201d Iran\u2019s Fars News Agency reported at the time.\n\nThe loss of Damavand is a blow to these ambitions. Her two sister ships, Jamaran and Sahand, are Persian Gulf warships."
