Government officials from France and the United States also attended the ceremony, along with representatives from Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT).\n\nFrance will receive a total of four Super Hercules aircraft \u2014 two C-130J-30 combat delivery airlifters and two KC-130J aerial refuelers \u2014 through a Foreign Military Sale with the U.S. government, with deliveries taking place through 2019.

The C-130J Super Hercules is the most advanced tactical airlifter in operation today, offering superior performance and enhanced capabilities with the range and versatility for every theater of operations and evolving requirements.\n\nTo learn more about Lockheed Martin's C-130J Super Hercules, visit www.lockheedmartin.com/c130\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 97,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\nSOURCE Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company"
