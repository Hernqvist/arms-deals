  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 An official from the U.S. Defense Department told reporters Monday the department will be reviewing General Dynamic\u2019s proposed acquisition of CSRA due to concerns over competition in the federal IT market.\n\n\u201cAny defense-related mergers and acquisition would be examined by the Department of Defense,\u201d said Jerry McGinn, the principal deputy director of DoD\u2019s office of manufacturing and industrial base policy. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve filed yet ... but I can say that is one of the cases \u2014 we are going to review that case, for competition [concerns].\u201d\n\nThe $9.6 billion merger would make GDIT-CSRA among the largest players in the federal IT industry, along with market giant Leidos. Part of GDIT\u2019s rationale for acquiring CSRA was its belief the federal IT market is a consolidating market, and in order to effectively compete for larger contracts it needed to expand.\n\nIn that sense, the biggest influence on General Dynamics portfolio will be among civilian agencies, particularly State and Justice departments and the Homeland Security Department, according to data company Govini. That said, CSRA will expand the past performance of General Dynamics\u2019 technology services within the DoD by 93.3 percent, according to the Govini report.\n\n"
