  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has objected to 37 provisions in the House draft of the annual Pentagon policy bill, but it stopped short of threatening a presidential veto.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday released a policy statement on the draft 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which is being debated in the House this week. The statement said the president will support the bill\u2019s passage, and detailed what the administration hopes legislators will massage as the bill churns through Congress.\n\nThe White House objected to the bill\u2019s prohibition on the Air Force killing the JSTARS recap program and starting afresh with a family-of-systems approach called the Advanced Battle Management System.\n\n\u201cThe JSTARS recapitalization program will be unable to perform its mission in high-end contested environments, which is counter to the National Defense Strategy,\u201d the statement reads. It called an investment in ABMS \u201cprudent\u201d and a better fit for future military fights.\n\nThe bill\u2019s elimination of the $222 million for the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter is also premature, according to the memo. The C-135 is the replacement for aging reconnaissance aircraft that enforce the 1992 Open Skies Treaty.\n\nThe administration objects to a proposed increase from 11 aircraft carriers to 12, \u201cwhich may not be sustainable\u201d under the Navy\u2019s current budget. The White House also opposes a provision in the bill that prohibits the Navy from fully exercising five-year procurement authority for the Virginia-class submarine, or SSN, until it certifies it will procure two more SSNs than the budget contains.\n\nThe White House would rather not shutter the Defense Information Systems Agency. It\u2019s not on board with the bill\u2019s transfer of all information technology contracting, acquisition, and senior leader communication services from DISA to other DoD elements.\n\n\u201cThis action would increase the cost of acquiring information technology, weaken the Department\u2019s ability to secure its cyber networks, and inhibit DISA\u2019s mission to provide seamless communication to warfighters and senior leaders,\u201d the policy statement reads.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

The Pentagon has not yet finished a review of its space organizational and management structure as required by last year\u2019s NDAA.\n\nThe White House is sticking up for the Pentagon\u2019s Strategic Capabilities Office, which the bill would nix. That\u2019s objectionable because the SCO\u2019s work is \u201ccritical to maintaining our advantage over our strategic competitors,\u201d according to the statement, which also pointed to concern that its elimination and transfer of functions would place operating forces at risk.\n\n"
