  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate has blocked legislation to stop an estimated $300 million in arms sales to Bahrain. Lawmakers rejected a call by Republican Sen. Rand Paul to send a message that the U.S. is \u201cdone with the war in Yemen.\u201d\n\nBahrain is a member of the Saudi-led coalition at war with Iran-aligned rebels in Yemen since March 2015.\n\nThe vote against Paul\u2019s resolution disapproving of the arms sale was 77-21.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican says millions in Yemen are at risk of starvation. He calls the war counterproductive to the long-term interests of the U.S. because it worsens chaos in the Mideast and potentially strengthens terrorist groups.\n\nBut opponents said Bahrain is a critical ally and home to a naval base the U.S. needs to protect its interests in the region.\n\nThe Associated Press"
