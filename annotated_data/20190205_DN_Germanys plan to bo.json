  "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Germany may be unable to deliver on its pledge to increase the defense budget due to smaller-than-expected economic growth, according to a new Finance Ministry analysis.\n\nThe projections peg the military budget to be several billion euros short of the trajectory to meet the government\u2019s goal of reaching 1.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2024. Analysts even see the current spending curve unable to sustain 1.35 percent in the years ahead.\n\nNATO members in 2014 agreed to boost their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP within 10 years.\n\nDenmark ups defense budget Denmark will increase its defense budget, though not for a few years.\n\nGermany\u2019s defense budget is roughly \u20ac43 billion (U.S. $49 billion) for 2019, or about 1.2 percent of GDP. That is a boost of \u20ac4 billion over the previous year.\n\nDefence Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Monday said Germany remains committed to hitting the self-declared 1.5 percent target in 2024. She portrayed the Finance Ministry\u2019s analysis as a mere first step toward a budget proposal negotiated by Cabinet secretaries. The government is expected to unveil such a plan in late March.\n\nThe Trump administration has often criticized Germany for underspending on defense, arguing Berlin rides on American coattails when it comes to security. News that the country\u2019s spending target is at risk is sure to embolden the narrative in Washington that Europe is somehow taking advantage of the United States. It could weaken the negotiating position of German government delegates at two high-profile events in mid-February: a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, and the Munich Security Conference.\n\nThe Finance Ministry\u2019s economic outlook estimates that agencies will have to reconcile new spending priorities within their previously established budget targets. That means no fresh money would become available for the government\u2019s push on artificial intelligence, for example, according to the document."
