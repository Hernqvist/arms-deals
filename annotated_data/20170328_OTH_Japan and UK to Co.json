  "text": "Japan and the United Kingdom have agreed to explore options to jointly develop a new fighter aircraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJapan\u2019s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency and the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defense have concluded an agreement to explore options for co-developing an advanced fighter jet, according to a March 16 press release by the Japanese Ministry of Defense.\n\nThe agreement stipulates that both countries will exchange information about advanced aviation technology and also conduct a joint study on the feasibility of co-developing a new fighter aircraft in the coming years.\n\nThe press release further notes that Japan will continue to explore fighter jet co-development options with other countries. \u201cRegarding the possibility of international joint development on fighter aircraft in the future, we will continue to exchange views with other countries,\u201d the MoD statement reads.\n\nWhile the next-generation fighter jet project would be the biggest Japan-UK collaboration on sensitive defense technology so far, both countries are also a working on jointly developing a new ramjet-powered, beyond a visual range air-to-air missile.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nDuring a January 2016 visit, the UK defense minister and his Japanese counterpart agreed to move discussions on the project to the next stage. The aim of the project is to integrate Japanese seeker technologies into the European Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nIn October 2016, the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) also held their first-ever joint aerial combat drill, dubbed Guardian North 16, in Japan. The exercise involved four RAF Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, JASDF Boeing F-15J all-weather air superiority fighters and Mitsubishi F-2s.\n\nThe Eurofighter consortium, which includes the United Kingdom, unsuccessfully tried to pitch the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to Japan in 2011. The JASDF, however, opted for the U.S.-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jet instead. Japan placed an order for 42 F-35 through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program in 2011. The first aircraft was handed over to the JASDF in December 2016.\n\nNevertheless, the F-35 order is an interim solution and Japan is slated to procure up to 100 new fifth-generation air superiority fighters by the 2030s. An estimated $20 billion contract is expected to be awarded in the summer of 2018 (See: \u201cJapan\u2019s Air Force to Receive 100 New Stealth Fighter Jets\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I explained in July 2016, Japan has three options for procuring for the new aircraft: \u201cFirst, develop an indigenous air superiority fighter. Second, partner with a foreign defense contractor and license-produce a new aircraft. Third, import or upgrade an existing platform.\u201d The UK-Japan joint study falls into the second option of partnering with a foreign aircraft maker.\n\nHowever, U.S. aircraft makers will remain Japan\u2019s top choice for any future fighter jet co-development projects. Last year, Japan unveiled an experimental fifth-generation fighter technology demonstrator, dubbed X-2 \u201cShinshin\u201d (formerly the ATD-X), which will be the basis for the JASDF\u2019s so-called (F-3) Future Fighter Program. As I reported last year, U.S. defense contractor Lockheed-Martin is purportedly already involved with the project in some capacity."
