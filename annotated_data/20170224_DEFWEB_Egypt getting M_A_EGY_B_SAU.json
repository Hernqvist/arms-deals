  "text": "Dubai-based Minerva Special Purpose Vehicles (MSPV) is building large numbers of Panthera T6 light armoured vehicles for Egypt\u2019s military.\n\nThis was revealed at the IDEX 2017 defence show earlier this week. IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly quoted Mohamed Emad el-Kabbany, MSPV\u2019s assistant manager for sales and business development, as saying that Egypt is receiving between 2 000 and 3 000 Panthera T6s for its police and army.\n\nHe added that Egyptian company Eagles Defence International Systems (EDIS) is the company\u2019s Egyptian agent \u2013 in 2014 it was reported that EDIS was producing the Panthera T6, as well as the larger S10 and K10CMD.\n\nThe Panthera T6 was first seen in May 2014 during an Egyptian military parade and subsequently seen in the Sinai Peninsula. At least some have been fitted with electronic warfare equipment for use in the Sinai.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its Arms Transfers Database, lists 50 Panthera T6s being ordered from the UAE in 2013, with deliveries from 2014-2015.\n\nAccordign to MSPV, the Panthera T6 is powered by a 4 litre V6 petrol engine driving all four wheels through a five speed manual transmission. It seats two plus six, although other seating arrangements are available. Features include air conditioning, a remote controlled roof mounted search light and camera, optional gun ports and hatches.\n\nThe Panthera T6 is based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 79-series chassis. An optional mount on the roof can accommodate a machinegun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibya has apparently taken delivery of Panthera T6s donated by the United Arab Emirates. They were delivered in April 2016. The Panthera T6 was seen several times in March 2015 in use by the Libyan National Army. In September last year Indian security forces introduced the vehicle into service, particularly for security in Jammu and Kashmir."
