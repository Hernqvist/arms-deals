Photo: Vipin Chandran\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Gifts\u2019 will pave the way for further strengthening bilateral relations, says Madivian Minister\n\n\n\nIndia on Saturday donated a second naval Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), Dhruv, to the Maldives in a gesture that was described by Maldivian Minister for Defence Mohamed Nazim as \u201cpaving the way for further strengthening of ties between both countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nA brand new, Mark-III (the latest) variant of the India-made multi-role helicopter in Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) colours was unveiled at a simple ceremony attended by Mr. Nazim, Vice-Admiral Satish Soni, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, and MNDF Brigadier General Ali Zuhair besides senior formations from both sides, officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and representatives of the helicopter manufacturer, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, at naval air station Garuda in Kochi.\n\n\n\nCordial relation\n\n\n\nOn the last leg of his India visit, Mr. Nazim said the Maldives maintained a friendly and cordial relation with its neighbours, especially India, which stood by the nation whenever it needed support. Defence cooperation between both countries grew drastically over the past few years with Indian armed forces, particularly the Navy, contributing greatly to MNDF\u2019s capacity-building. He said the \u2018gift\u2019 would help the island nation\u2019s Coast Guard carry out search and rescue and medical evacuation from its far-flung territories.\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni said India shared long-standing ties with Maldives. While Indian Navy trained MNDF personnel and despatched its ships and aircraft to patrol the Maldivian exclusive economic zone, the Maldives contributed to security in the Indian Ocean region by enhanced surveillance and anti-piracy patrol. The nation also actively participated in forums such as the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) and the biennial exercise Milan.\n\n\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni told the media later that provisioning the ALH, the face of India\u2019s aviation industry, was indicative of the importance India attached to its relationship with the island nation. While the ALH already in operation with the Maldivian Coast Guard was based at the southern Maldivian island of Addu, the more advanced, second helicopter \u2014 which also sports a weather radar\u2014 would operate from the northern Hannimadhoo Island, primarily on medical evacuation duty. The helicopter would be initially manned and maintained by an all-Indian crew.\n\n\n\nMaldives top priority\n\n\n\nThe Maldives topped India\u2019s priority alongside Bangladesh, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Defence cooperation between both countries was set for further growth, he said. As many as 16 MNDF personnel were presently undergoing training at India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, the Indian Navy\u2019s Training Command.\n\n\n\n(The Indian Navy has trained MNDF personnel since 1988. Maldivian defence personnel subscribe to at least 35 courses every year)\n\n\n\nT. Suvarna Raju, Director (Design and Development) of HAL, said the Mark-III variant of the indigenous chopper sported a digital cockpit and was capable of performing several roles.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-donates-second-naval-advanced-light-helicopter-to-maldives/article5456867.ece J'aime Je n'aime pas\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSujet: Re: Maldives National Defence Force Dim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32 Sujet: Re: Maldives National Defence ForceDim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW !!

But the reason behind the demotion is unclear.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Fayaz's lawyers are looking to appeal the decision by the Criminal Court to deny a habeas corpus writ over his detention.\n\n\n\nCriminal Court on Wednesday denied a habeus corpus writ over the detention of Fayaz.\n\n\n\nThe court said the writ request was rejected by its registrar as the defence ministry denied detaining Fayaz inside the military headquarters.\n\n\n\nFayaz\u2019s attorney Mahfooz Saeed had said he would seek the intervention of the Criminal Court judges in order to nullify the decision by the court\u2019s registrar.\n\n\n\nGovernment had also blamed army officers in charge of the armoury for the weapons stash found following the blast from an uninhabited island, labelling them as having had committed treason.\n\n\n\nThe weapons found from the island of Hinbalhidhoo in Baa Atoll, which is being developed as a tourist resort, included several hand guns, a T56 assault rifle and a MP5 sub-machine gun. In addition, a large quantity of bomb making material was also discovered.\n\n\n\nThe military had confirmed that the two rifles found in the island were from the state armoury.\n\n\n\nThe primary suspect in the weapons stash seized from the Hibilhadhoo island has, meanwhile, denied any connection to the weapons. Mohamed Allam Latheef is one of the four shareholders of a company that owns Hibilhadhoo.\n\n\n\nLocal authorities, meanwhile, has identified Allam and seven others as wanted in two separate cases related to the explosion aboard the presidential speedboat late September, now confirmed as an attempt to kill the president.\n\n\n\nThe now deposed Vice President Ahmed Adheeb Abdul Ghafoor was arrested over the blast shortly after. He has since been impeached after the ruling coalition lawmakers moved a no-confidence motion through the government controlled parliament.\n\n\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim were travelling to Male from the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport (INIA), located on the nearby island of Hulhule which is a five-minute ferry ride from the capital city, on September 28 when the explosion took place.
