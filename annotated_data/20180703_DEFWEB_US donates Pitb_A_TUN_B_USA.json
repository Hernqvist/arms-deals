Tunisian Minister of Justice and acting Minister of the Interior Ghazi Jeribi said \u201cthese armoured vehicles will significantly contribute to the increase in the fighting capacity against terrorist groups in Tunisia.\u201d\n\nUS Ambassador to Tunisia Daniel Rubinstein said Tunisia was successful in maintaining security and fighting against terrorism, and Tunisia would prove itself as a stable and peaceful country.\n\nThe Pitbull VXs will be operated by the Tunisian Counter-Terrorism Brigade, which reports to the Intervention Units General Directorate.\n\nThe Pitbull VX is built by Alpine Armouring and is based on the Ford F-550 chassis. Designed for SWAT teams, it is powered by a 6.7 litre Rod V8 developing 303 hp. The vehicle weights 7.5 tongs and can carry eight fully equipped SWAT members. Armour protection is to A9/B6+ level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, the US Army has provided Tunisia with aircraft, navy vessels, high-tech intelligence and surveillance equipment as well as specialised counter-terrorism training and equipment to equip and professionalise the post-revolutionary army."
