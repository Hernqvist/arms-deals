Jenni Reid\n\nGovernment proposes $6B budget for 2018\n\nThe Council of Ministers on Friday approved a national budget for next year that calls for more than $6 billion in spending, the largest increase ever proposed for the Kingdom, with big boosts for education, defence and the arts.\n\nIn an executive summary of the draft law released on Friday, the Council of Ministers proposes raising the budget by nearly $1 billion, stating that the budget increases are necessary to run the Senate and national elections next year and to improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe royal government must ensure both elections will be smooth, orderly, correct, free and fair,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn addition, the money is also needed \u201cto ensure defence, peace and social stability\u201d in order to prevent \u201cany tricks and any kinds of attempts to make the country fall into chaos and instability\u201d.\n\nThe proposal will go to the National Assembly by the end of the week \u2013 the second time in as many years that the legislative body is forced to decide the budget amid significant political turmoil.\n\nCambodia National Rescue Party President Party President Kem Sokha is currently in pretrial detention on \u201ctreason\u201d charges, while Prime Minister Hun Sen has alleged the party as a whole is involved in a plot to topple the CPP-led government.\n\nLast year, the CPP-controlled National Assembly voted in favour of a $5 billion budget for 2017 in the absence of CNRP lawmakers, who boycotted in protest of a number of politically charged legal cases against their colleagues.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, the Ministry of Education will see the single biggest funding boost, of roughly $167 million, or 24 percent. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Health are also set to receive sizeable increases of 17 and 15 percent, respectively, or $80 million and $63 million.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts would see the single largest percentage increase, more than doubling from $20 million this year to a proposed budget of $47 million.\n\nReached yesterday, CNRP lawmaker Mao Monyvann said he had not yet seen the full budget but $6 billion seemed to be \u201ctoo much\u201d. He said the focus of the budget-makers should be on increasing funding transparency and boosting education.\n\n\u201cTo stay within budget, we suggest more transparency,\u201d Monyvann said. \u201c[For example], before approving any government projects, please have public bidding.\u201d\n\nCambodia\u2019s budget process has been criticised in the past by good governance NGOs, such as International Budget Partners (IBP), for lacking detail and transparency. Since 2015, however, the process has improved, according to IBP\u2019s metrics, with year-end reports now produced for internal use and audits made available to the public, among other reforms. Nonetheless, full budget proposals are typically not made public before passage of the law.\n\nCouncil of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan said that the budget hikes were justified, pointing to needs in the education sector and for recruitment of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe need it,\u201d Siphan said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t need it, why would we increase it?\u201d\n\nSee last year's budget here.\n\nSan Chey, head of the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability Cambodia, expressed concern that the budget process is moving too quickly in an uncertain political climate, with NGOs and lawmakers lacking the opportunity for input.\n\n\u201cThe tense political situation impedes the opposition party from having the opportunity to check and evaluate 2018 national budgets,\u201d Chey said.\n\nAccording to the Council of Ministers, the budget will also fund several initiatives announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen in recent speeches \u2013 including pledges to fund salary increases for civil servants, pregnancy care for garment workers and tax breaks for people who earn less than $300 per month.\n\nThe council did not explain how much the government is budgeting for those initiatives.\n\nSiphan said more detailed questions about the budget would have to wait until the full proposal is sent to the National Assembly for debate. Instead of having the chance to give their input directly, NGOs can try to persuade assembly representatives, he said.\n\n\u201cThey could voice their opinion on what they want and what they don\u2019t agree with to the National Assembly,\u201d he said."
