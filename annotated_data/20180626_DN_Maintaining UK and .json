  "text": "LONDON \u2014 Britain needs to raise defense spending by over \u00a38 billion a year, or U.S. $10.59 billion, to not undermine the military relationship with the U.S. says a report by the parliamentary defence committee.\n\nThe report, which looks at the U.K.\u2019s defense relations with the U.S. and NATO, recommends Britain increases the percentage of gross domestic product being allocated to the military first to 2.5 percent and eventually 3 percent if the country is to maintain the military relationship with the U.S. and keep its leading role in NATO.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. armed forces and the Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the U.S. However, that will continue to be true only while the U.K. military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the U.S. military and to relieve U.S. burdens. For this to be the case the U.K. armed forces must be funded appropriately,\u201d said the report released June 26.\n\nThe lawmakers urged a significant rise in a defense budget which currently just manages to squeeze above the 2 percent of gross domestic product demanded by NATO for defense spending.\n\nExcluded from cooperative plans in Europe, UK sets groundwork for future fighters Left out in the cold by a joint Franco-German plan to develop a new fighter, British officials have been working for months on a combat air strategy to sustain Britain\u2019s capabilities beyond the Eurofighter Typhoon, and they are determined to figure out a way forward this summer.\n\n\u201cWe calculate that raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP would result in a forecast spend of \u00a350 billion per annum and raising it to 3% of GDP would take this to \u00a360 billion per annum,\u201d said the lawmakers.\n\nThe defense budget this year is set at \u00a337 billion with small real term increases expected annually up to 2022.\n\nA rise to 3 percent would see defence spending return to a level \u2014 in GDP percentage terms \u2014 that has not been seen since 1995.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

(Marko Mumm/AP)\n\nThe U.S, Britain, China, Russia and France are the only nations with a tier one status \u2014 which basically means they are able to fight nuclear, conventional and other conflicts around the world.\n\nThe committee said military-to-military engagement between the U.K. and the U.S. was one of the linchpins of the bilateral relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe report said the U.K. benefits greatly from the width and depth of the U.K.-U.S. defense and security relationship, but such a relationship requires a degree of interoperability that can be sustained only through investment in U.K. armed forces.\n\nThe importance of the military relationship between the U.S. and Europe\u2019s leading military power also extends into NATO.\n\nLawmakers said the relationship is vital to the functioning of NATO while the U.K.\u2019s leading contribution to the alliance helps to sustain the relationship between London and Washington.\n\nJulian Lewis, the Defence Committee chairman, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cDefence spending is an area where a strong message needs to be sent to our allies and adversaries alike. The Government has consistently talked about increasing the U.K.\u2019s commitment to NATO after our departure from the European Union. An increased commitment, in the face of new and intensified threats, means that further investment is essential,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nThe warning in the report over the risks to the military relationship between London and Washington follows a similar warning in February by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis that Britain had to retain a credible military if the relationship between the two nations was to endure and strengthen.\n\nWilliamson said that in financial terms alone the U.K. benefits to the tune of \u00a33 billion a year from the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship.\n\nJohn Spellar MP, the Defence Committee\u2019s senior Labour Party member and former armed forces minister said the inquiry has \u201cunderlined the importance of the U.K.-U.S. relationship in the area of defense and security and emphasizes the benefit which the U.K. receives as a result.\u201d"
