  "text": "Lenco Industries, Inc., the global leader in the design and manufacture of armored police vehicles, recently completed delivery of 88 BearCat\u00ae armored vehicles to the Moroccan Auxiliary Forces. The BearCat\u00ae is part of Lenco\u2019s line of light and medium armored response vehicles, which are used by hundreds of Specialized Tactical teams in the United States and abroad.\n\nWith military grade armor materials, an open floor plan and a powerful 4\u00d74 system, the BearCat\u00ae can easily accommodate 10 to 12 operators across rugged terrain. The BearCat can also reach speeds up to 90 Mph (145 Kph) for rapid response in critical incidents. Due to its ease of use, low maintenance costs, and innovative designs, the BearCat\u00ae is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to up-armored military vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe Moroccan Auxiliary Forces order included 5 different BearCat\u00ae variants, designed to address a variety of mission profiles. The BearCat\u00ae Riot Control model, which is specifically designed for international police forces, was among the variants. This BearCat\u00ae model is equipped with a heavy-duty hydraulic plow capable of moving cars, debris, and other barriers. The BearCat Riot Control variant also has protective screens on all windows and lights, fire suppression capabilities and several non-lethal options for hostile riot conditions. The remaining BearCat variants delivered to Morocco included Troop Transport, Communications, Convoy Protection and SWAT.\n\nThe Lenco BearCat APC is built on a commercially available chassis, which allows for warranty-covered repairs with maintenance and parts replacement through OEM dealers and truck centers. This greatly reduces lifecycle maintenance costs and training expenses when compared with specialized military vehicles. The armored trucks for the order were manufactured at Lenco\u2019s primary facility in Pittsfield, MA.\n\nAbout Lenco Industries, Inc.\n\nLenco Industries designs and manufactures armored tactical vehicles for Law Enforcement, Military and Government agencies located throughout the United States and allied nations around the globe. Lenco vehicles are trusted every day to protect our nation\u2019s defenders and first responders in safeguarding our domestic homeland security, as well as downrange in hostile regions such as Iraq and Afghanistan.
