But there was the little problem of all that noise and radiation.\n\nFile this one under terrible, terrible weapons ideas of the Cold War alongside undersea bases, atomic artillery and ship-launched rocket planes.\n\nThe nuclear boat motor actually began life as airplane propulsion, if you can believe that. America\u2019s two great aircraft engine-makers, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, both hand their fingers in this particular radioactive pie.\n\nPratt & Whitney tinkered with a closed-loop system in which the radioactive components were kept isolated from the jet exhaust. GE, however, opted for the easier-to-develop open-loop system, which led to nearly flight-ready hardware \u2026 at the regrettable cost of highly-radioactive jet exhaust.\n\nThe safety issues alone doomed the nuke jet \u2014 to say nothing of the extraordinary cost.\n\nIn 1961, after spending nearly 15 years and $1 billion \u2014 $7.7 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 the feds killed off the nuclear-powered aircraft program. But GE wasted no time looking for other uses for its designs.\n\nAbove and at top \u2014 General Electric art\n\nThe engine-maker ended up publishing a 21-volume report on the atomic motor work, and in the fullness of time these documents made their way onto the Internet. In the section entitled \u201cAPEX 910: Application Studies,\u201d you can read for yourself GE\u2019s wacky proposal to put its nuclear engine in a pod and bolt it onto a ship.\n\nIt was aerospace historian Scott Lowther who labelled GE\u2019s 601B Power Package the \u201cnuclear outboard motor\u201d \u2014 and that precisely captures its nature.\n\nIn one sleek fat, torpedo-shaped pod, GE proposed to encapsulate a nuclear reactor and a gas turbine in inert neon gas. The reactor would heat the gas which would drive the turbine as it expanded, while reduction gearing would translate the turbine\u2019s spin into propeller revolutions. The seawater surrounding the pod would act as coolant and shielding.\n\nUnlike an internal-combustion engine, the atomic outboard could run for tens of thousands of miles before needing refueling. If a malfunction demanded shutdown or scuttling of the nuclear engine, the pod could simply be jettisoned into the deep.\n\nWe are talking the late 1950s, after all. Apparently nobody worried about depositing a bunch of radioactive waste all over the ocean floor.\n\nGeneral Electric art\n\nA typical 601B power pod would be a cylindrical capsule 18 feet long, four feet in diameter and weighing 12 tons. Fueled with 250 pounds of U-235, it could produce 3,700 horsepower for over six months.\n\nLowther and atomic historian \u201cMark\u201d pointed out that, like an outboard motor, such a power pod could be attached to pretty much any seaworthy vessel \u2014 and you could easily de-nuclearize it later.\n\n\u201c[T]hese units would make dandy propulsion systems for cargo vessels,\u201d Lowther wrote. \u201cSince all of the propulsion system was in outboard pods, the ship could be nothing but a big empty cargo hold.\u201d\n\nFor military vessels, replacing the conventional engines with 601Bs could potentially double their available payload. GE\u2019s in-house artists sketched a destroyer and a submarine on patrol, each driven by whirring 601Bs. The pods would be mounted on fins or pylons attached to the same places where conventional propeller shafts go.\n\nBesides subs and destroyers, the Navy\u2019s now-retired hydrofoils were another potential application for the atomic outboard, as they already carried their motors in pods. But the thought of enduring a hydrofoil\u2019s bronco-busting ride for days on end is enough to give pause to the firmest constitution.\n\nThere was another problem. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think the drag from those pods would be pretty noisy,\u201d Mark noted. The 601Bs would have made American warships easy targets for prowling Soviet subs."
