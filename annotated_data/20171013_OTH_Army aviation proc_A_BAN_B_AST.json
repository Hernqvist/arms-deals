  "text": "Hi !\n\n\n\nI just joined this forum because recently the type 69 II G has been introduced into the video game \"war thunder\". The thing is, there have been conflicts to know if the vehicle was representated correctly. Depending on the source I can find, it has either a 105mm gun or a 120mm, a thermal imager sight or not etc.\n\n\n\nSo I think asking the experts might be a better idea, and here I am\n\n\n\nExcuse me if this isnt the good location or if it's off topic, I'm a bit lost\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for your anwsers !\n\n\n\n8 replies"
