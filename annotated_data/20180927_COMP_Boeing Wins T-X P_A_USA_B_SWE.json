LOUIS, Sept. 27, 2018 \u2013 U.S. Air Force pilots will soon train for combat with T-X jets and simulators from Boeing [NYSE: BA].\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the culmination of years of unwavering focus by the Boeing and Saab team,\u201d said Leanne Caret, president and CEO, Boeing Defense, Space & Security. \u201cIt is a direct result of our joint investment in developing a system centered on the unique requirements of the U.S. Air Force. We expect T-X to be a franchise program for much of this century.\u201d\n\nBoeing and its risk-sharing partner Saab designed, developed, and flight tested two all-new, purpose-built jets \u2015 proving out the system\u2019s design, repeatability in manufacturing and training capability.\n\n\u201cThis selection allows our two companies to deliver on a commitment we jointly made nearly five years ago,\u201d said H\u00e5kan Buskhe, president and CEO of Saab. \u201cIt is a major accomplishment for our partnership with Boeing and our joint team, and I look forward to delivering the first trainer aircraft to the Air Force.\u201d\n\nBoeing is now clear to begin placing orders with its suppliers, including Saab. More than 90 percent of Boeing\u2019s offering will be made in America, supporting more than 17,000 jobs in 34 states.\n\nSaab serves the global market with world-leading products, services and solutions within military defense and civil security.
