  "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Services giant SAIC has completed its $2.5 billion acquisition of Engility, the company announced Monday.\n\nThe acquisition, made public in September, makes SAIC the second-largest government services contractor, behind competitor Leidos. It will comprise more than 23,000 employees.\n\nSAIC stockholders will own roughly 72 percent of the combined company, and Engility stockholders approximately 28 percent.\n\nIn an interview with Defense News last September, SAIC CEO Tony Moraco said Engility\u2019s \u201cmulti-intelligence agency portfolio,\u201d along with the company\u2019s space programs, made Engility an ideal target for SAIC.\n\n\u201cSo for a single transaction at scale where we could in fact use our equity, [and face] probably fewer buyers, filling three or four of our strategic initiatives in market access and in capabilities \u2014 we felt it was worth a serious look,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the biggest move yet in the services sector, which has recently seen significant merger and acquisition activity.\n\nApril saw the $9.7 billion buyout of CSRA by General Dynamics Information Technology. CSRA was a combination of former competitors Computer Sciences Corporation\u2019s North American public sector business and SRA International.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
