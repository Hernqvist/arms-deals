The Afghan National Army’s (ANA) Air Force has dropped a laser-guided bomb on a Taliban stronghold in Farah province, in the west of Afghanistan, for the first time in combat, the Ministry of Defense confirmed.

Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said some local Taliban commanders were killed in the raid.

Afghan forces will target Taliban strongholds from the air by using the technology, he said. According to the MoD, the bomb was dropped three days ago.

However, the US Department of Defense said an A-29 Super Tucano, equipped with both guided and unguided bombs, dropped the GBU-58 on March 22.

Radmanish said: “This is new and modern technology (for Afghanistan) in which a bomb is dropped by a pilot from inside the aircraft’s cabin and is guided by the pilot towards its target.”

Some MPs meanwhile said it was a big step in fighting terrorists in the country.

“Our demand is to use all facilities on the ground to eliminate the enemy. This technology was not provided to our forces previously. Now the Afghan forces should use the opportunity,” said Mohayuddin Monsef, a member of Meshrano Jirga, the Upper House of Parliament.

“You must win when a war starts. I hope that this technology will help our forces move towards victory,” said Khalil Ahmad Shaheedzada, an MP.

This comes amid an ever-strengthening air force. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Defense also confirmed that India will supply Afghanistan with four Mi-24 helicopters ahead of the upcoming fighting season.

Afghanistan reached out to India for assistance in acquiring some helicopters urgently needed to help in counter-terrorism operations.
