Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, left for a visit to Israel and Jordan on Sunday, as his nation pivots away from a long-time reliance on American military hardware and support.

The four-day visit to Israel will be the first by a Philippine leader in more than 60 years of diplomatic ties between the two nations.

Mr Duterte, accompanied by an entourage including soldiers and police, will sit down with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and hold an event with some of the thousands of Filipino migrant workers in Israel.

Mr Duterte has become notorious for controversial statements - including likening himself to Hitler - and his internationally condemned drug crackdown that has killed thousands.

"We assign great importance to this visit, which symbolises the strong, warm ties between our two peoples," Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement.

Mr Duterte has led the Philippines away from the US, its former colonial master, and towards closer diplomatic and business ties with China and Russia.

The US and Canada have both seen military hardware deals fall apart with the Philippines due to concerns over Mr Duterte's drug war. But so far sales with Israel have gone smoothly.
