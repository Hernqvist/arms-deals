Kennedy Agyapong, the Member of Parliament for Assin Central, says the Flagstaff House - the seat of government - has bought a $39 million shoulder fired surface to air missile to be used to destabilise the country during the December elections.

Mr Agyapong made the claim in an interview on Homebase TV on Wednesday.

He said the Mahama administration is scared of losing the election and plans to forment violence in some crucial regions in order to rig the elections.

The MP said heavy weaponry and ammunition had been imported into the country for this purpose.

Mr Agyapong said that he had pictures to prove his claims, but did not make them available on the show.
