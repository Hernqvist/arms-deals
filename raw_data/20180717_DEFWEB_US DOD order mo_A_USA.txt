The United States Department of Defence (DoD) has awarded Chemring Sensors and Electronic Systems a $92 million contract for the procurement of Husky mine detection vehicles, which are manufactured in South Africa by DCD Protected Mobility.

On 15 August the DoD said Chemring Sensors and Electronic Systems Inc of Dulles, Virginia, was awarded a $92 556 056 firm-fixed-price contract to procure Husky Mounted Detection System systems, spare and repair parts. One bid was solicited with one bid received.

The Husky is DCD’s flagship route clearance vehicle, and is able to detect mines at 5km/h-35km/h. It uses metal detectors for metallic mines and ground-penetrating radar for non-metal mines, but can be fitted with various sensors and interrogation arms. The Husky comes in several variants, including the single seat Husky Mk III, second generation two seat Husky 2G and optionally unmanned Autonomous Husky. The vehicle can be fitted with a wide variety of sensors and optional extras, including cameras, mine roller system, cyclone blower, remote weapons station, 360-degree camera system, gunshot detection system and RPG protection nets.
