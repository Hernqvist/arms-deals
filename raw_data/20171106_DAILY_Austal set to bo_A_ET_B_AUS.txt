Austal has welcomed an announcement by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Timor-Leste leader Mari Alkatiri that the South-East Asia country intends to take another two of the Perth-based shipbuilder’s Guardian Class pacific patrol boats.

The order would increase total production of the boats to 21 from the 19 already committed to early last year in a contract worth $305 million.

The announcement was made at this year’s Asia-Pacific Regional Conference in Perth, attended by both prime ministers over the weekend, and followed a visit to Austal’s patrol boat facility.

“The PPB program is intended to aid regional security in the South Pacific by helping to secure the Timor-Leste maritime border and represents an example of defence diplomacy fostering close relations between countries in the Asia-Pacific,” Austal chief executive David Singleton said.

“The first of the current order of Guardian Class patrol boats is already well into its construction phase and is running on time and on budget.

“The Guardian Class patrol boat project at Austal is supporting 200 direct jobs and a further 200 indirect jobs in the broader industry.

“This is in addition to several hundred more jobs supported by a large commercial export ship currently being built in the Henderson yard.

“We are working on other export opportunities for the Guardian Class patrol boat thereby helping Australia sustain its sovereign naval shipbuilding industry which has already delivered over 40 patrol boats to international customers.”
