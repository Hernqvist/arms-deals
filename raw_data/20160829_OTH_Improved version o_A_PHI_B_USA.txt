The improved version of M113A2 Armored Personnel Carriers with 25mm Elbit Systems’ unmanned turrets was spotted in Philippine.

Earlier it was reported that the Army of the Philippines has signed a contract with Elbit Systems for the procurement of 4 upgraded M113A2 with 25mm cannons and 6 units with 12.7mm machine guns.

The improved version of M113A2 Armored Personnel Carriers will have Remote Control Weapons System (RWS) designed by Elbit Systems. The electronically-driven turrets can be configured with various types of cannons (25 or 30mm), coaxial machine guns (7.62mm) and guided anti-tank missiles. Featuring a high first-round hit probability, the dual-axis stabilized turret is designed for firing on-the-move and at moving targets. Fully overhead with no deck penetration, the turrets do not compromise the vehicle’s armor protection and preserve existing space within the vehicle. In addition, the turrets provide enhanced situational awareness under closed hatches and are easily adaptable to a wide range of new and existing vehicles.
