CHINA and Australia are very good friends who continue to trade with each other and are important to the Asia-Pacific region, says Prime Minister Peter O’Neill.

Responding to questions on how Papua New Guinea feels about having both Australia and China together at the Apec Leaders’ Summit, O’Neill said they had a huge role to play in lifting the standard of living in developing countries.

“Like any family, there are always going to be difficulties along the way,” he said.

“China and Australia are very good friends. They continue to trade with each other and are important to the region.

“It’s going to be a fruitful and worthwhile dialogue between all economies including China and Australia. We look forward to working with them.”

On how PNG was dealing with Australia, United States and China, O’Neill said PNG was not interested in geo-politics.

“We are very much interested in doing business with everyone,” he said.

“Those countries PNG have always had a strong bilateral relationship with, all the countries, and we want them to see the best of PNG.

“We want them to see the best of PNG and we want to welcome them in a hospitable manner in which Papua New Guineans are known for. We are in the Pacific. It is more relaxing and I hope that they enjoy their stay.”
