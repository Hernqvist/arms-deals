The social media reports over Bell-412 helicopters acquired by the Azerbaijani army are not exactly true, Spokesman of the Armenian Foreign Ministry Tigran Balayan told a news briefing on Monday.

He stated the military helicopters purchased by Azerbaijan Air Forces are not manufactured by the United States as some reports suggest.

Earlier experts questioned how Bell-412 helicopters produced by American aircraft manufacturer Bell Helicopter reached Baku given the U.S. legislation banning the country to supply arms to a party to conflict.

“We have started to deal with the issue of helicopters much earlier than the information went public. According to the information we presently have at hand, those helicopters are not U.S.-made, but rather manufactured by a number of states with an American license,” the spokesman said, adding they were intended for non-military use.

Touching upon the recent Azerbaijani provocations along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, in the direction of Nakhichevan, Mr Balayan noted that the country acts upon the principle of irresponsibility, failing to fulfil the commitments undertaken by it.

“We keep voicing this issue both before the [OSCE Minsk Group] co-chairing countries and our remaining partner states and organizations. I believe the co-chairs have a serious work to do here since Azerbaijan disregards the co-chairing countries by ignoring their calls and doing completely the opposite,” he added.
