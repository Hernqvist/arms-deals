KUALA LUMPUR: Three contenders for the RMN’s MRSS requirements are being showcase at DSA 2018 which starts tomorrow at the MITEC, Jalan Duta. There are probably others as well but these were the three that I saw today, the media preview day.

Two are the usual suspects, the PT PAL Makassar class variant and the Damen Enforcer 10000. The third is a dark horse, the Naval Group Mistral 170, colloquially call as the mini-Mistral. It is likely that a Chinese contender or two are also around in the halls but as most booths were still being set-up today I have to post these three first.



It is interesting to note that Boustead is not displaying a model of its own MRSS contender. They have two models of corvettes which seemed to indicate that they are not going ahead with a newer version of the Kedah class.



So which will be the MRSS design to be announced by the RMN as announced by the chief last week? I have no idea so far but I have been told that there is no funds allocated for the program so far. So it is unlikely an LOI will be sign for the MRSS soon. The LOA for the NSM is confirmed though with the LOI to be awarded for the MBDA VL MICA.
