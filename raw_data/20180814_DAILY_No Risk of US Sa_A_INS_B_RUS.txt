Jakarta. There is no risk of US sanctions following Indonesia's $1.14 billion deal to purchase 11 Sukhoi fighter jets from Russia, an official said on Monday (13/08).

"There is no pressure from the US regarding this [...] We are targeting to finish [the transaction] as soon as possible," Oke Nurwan, director general of foreign trade at the Ministry of Trade, told reporters.

Oke's words contradict his last week's statement that the United States has "started to intervene" after Russia agreed to the Sukhoi deal in February.

Indonesia is going to buy the jets in a counter-purchase deal, in which Russia will buy Indonesian commodities for 50 percent of the Sukhoi price. Russia is currently reviewing the agreement. The commodities include rubber, tea, coffee, palm oil and its derivatives, and textiles.

"We are now still drafting the rules for a working group to discuss the commodities that Russia must buy from Indonesia in return," Oke said.

The working group will consist of officials from Indonesia Trading Company (PPI) and Russia's military contracting company Rostec.

On Saturday, Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said the aircraft are scheduled to start arriving in October next year.

In August 2017, President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia to punish President Vladimir Putin for the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The sanctions extend to all US allies that purchase Russian weapons and equipment.
