Ukraine’s defense state enterprise Ukroboronprom korrespondent.net

The information space of the country continues to spread the information with signs of manipulation, misinformation or obvious incompetence. This is said in the Ukroboronprom state enterprise's statement.



"In particular, the statements of MP Biletsky about dozens of factories in Eastern Europe, which offer Ukraine cooperation in the repair and modernization of Soviet-made military equipment, ready to supply a wide range of components, and in general about the "infinity of spare parts in Europe”, can be considered such misinformation, the document reads.



Ukroboronprom stressed that as a result of the integration of Eastern Europe into NATO, the stocks of Soviet weapons and spare parts there are almost exhausted. "Therefore, the thesis of a respected deputy on the "infinity "is quite contradictory. Moreover, in this statement we see the speaker’s lack of clear understanding of such fundamental terminological nuances as ordinary repair of equipment and the supply of spare parts for the current production," the enterprise added.

It also clarified that despite the objective difficulties, the concern is developing cooperation with foreign partners, in particular that with armored enterprises in Eastern Europe."We emphasize that the statements of Mr. Biletsky, reinforced by the words of a representative of one of the private companies, Mr. Nosov, about the alleged restrictions on the admission of non-state companies to the state defense order, do not correspond to reality. The evidence is that about 60% of the state defense order was performed by the non-state enterprises," said the document.
