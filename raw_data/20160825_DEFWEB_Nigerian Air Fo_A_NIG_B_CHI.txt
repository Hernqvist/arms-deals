The Nigerian Air Force is apparently getting ready to take delivery of Yabhon Flash-20 unmanned aerial vehicles and Mi-35 attack helicopters.

Nigeria is apparently acquiring an additional 15 Mi-35M attack helicopters from Russia and Adcom Systems Yabhon Flash-20 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) from the United Arab Emirates. Some of the UAVs and three helicopters are supposed to arrive in November this year.

Nigerian media report that the Yabhon Flash-20 UAVs will replace the CH-3 armed UAVs acquired from China. One crashed in January 2015 and the type has apparently been problematic in Nigerian service. They have been armed with AR-1 missiles, and used to strike Boko Haram positions.

The Yabhon Flash 20 is the smallest of Adcom Systemsâ€™ UAVs at about 1.5 tonnes maximum take-off weight. It can fly for 60-70 hours and carries a gimbaled camera platform.

Nigeria also has Aerostar UAVs and some indigenous designs in service such as the Gulma.
