We are having a repitition of 1962 situation. China is pumping in unlimited funds into a industrial group known to control the PMOs office , which in turn is in a position to expand it''s communication venture with great speed. In return that industrial group forces the PM and the government not to buy any advance weapons which can be used to defend mother India. We are going through terrible times. Army has no weapons, Air Force has no planes and in case of need, how will we defend our borders. Sometimes I wonder, is their a plan to Balkanize India, by weakening the country''s defense preparation On purpose .
