Thailand’s military government has approved the acquisition of eight KAI T-50 Golden Eagle lead-in fighter trainers from South Korea, adding to four aircraft it acquired in 2015.

The $258 million deal will be paid over a three-year period, according to Air Vice Marshal Pongsak Semachai.

Designated T-50TH, the aircraft will replace the Royal Thai Air Force’s fleet of 40 Aero Vodochody L-39ZA/ART Albatros in the training and combat roles. The first four aircraft expected to be delivered by March 2018.

According to specifications released by KAI, the T-50TH will be fully combat capable, being fitted with fire control radar – expected to be the ELTA EL/M-2032 – MIL-STD-1760 databus and will have provision for the Link 16 data link.
