Hi !



I just joined this forum because recently the type 69 II G has been introduced into the video game "war thunder". The thing is, there have been conflicts to know if the vehicle was representated correctly. Depending on the source I can find, it has either a 105mm gun or a 120mm, a thermal imager sight or not etc.



So I think asking the experts might be a better idea, and here I am



Excuse me if this isnt the good location or if it's off topic, I'm a bit lost



Thanks in advance for your anwsers !
