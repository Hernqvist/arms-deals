Background Triangle

HD’s involvement in the South China Sea came about as a result of the claimants acknowledging the immediate need for a parallel framework to minimise recourse to armed violence at sea whilst discussions about resolving the dispute at official fora continued. In 2014, for instance, tensions between Vietnam and China soared due to an incident involving an oil rig in disputed waters, despite the fact that both countries had signed the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties which committed them to “resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means.” Although no lives were lost, one ship was sunk. After consultations in the four capitals, HD secured a mandate and agreed to facilitate informal multilateral dialogues aimed at promoting predictability and reducing tensions in the region, beginning with the first Experts’ Meeting in Singapore, held in June 2015.

Since then, a number of factors have contributed to the increased complexity of the disputes in the South China Sea, not least the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s 2016 ruling in favour of the Philippines against China’s continued developments on land and at sea in the disputed waters.
