BELGRADE (Serbia), August 9 (SeeNews) - Serbian defence minister Aleksandar Vulin said on Wednesday he expects the exports of the country's defence industry to rise by 20% in 2017 as a result of favourable market conditions.

The total value of export contracts signed by the Serbian defence industry currently stands at $754 million (642.5 million euro), Vulin said in a statement.

Serbia plans to take advantage of the favourable conditions on the global market and to invest in the development of the production capacity of the country's defence industry, Vulin said during a visit to the factory of state-owned defence products maker Krusik in Valjevo, in western Serbia.

Krusik has guaranteed workload for 2017, 2018 and 2019 and its exports are expected to exceed 80 million euro next year, the director of the factory, Mladen Petkovic, said in the statement.
