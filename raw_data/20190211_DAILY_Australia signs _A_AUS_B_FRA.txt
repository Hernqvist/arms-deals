The federal government announced the signing of the Attack class submarine Strategic Partnering Agreement with French shipbuilder Naval Group.

Defence and Naval Group officials have been locked in negotiations for several years to produce the 12 submarines.

In December there were reports the $50 billion project could arrive late and cost millions more than expected.
