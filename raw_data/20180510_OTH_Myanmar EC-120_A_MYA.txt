It is nice to get a new floating dock. I hope the navy will commissioned the 135 m frigate soon. And I really hope it got VLS air defense. Most of the frigate are around 110 m and our new frigate is 135 m. I hope it has weapon systems likewhich has a length of 135 m. I think it is a possibility given that we now have major navy cooperation with Russia.What do you guys think that it can happen or not ??
