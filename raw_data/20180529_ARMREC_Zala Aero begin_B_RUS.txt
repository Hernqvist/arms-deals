"The design of the drone took into account new technological solutions for the use of over 20 types of payload and additional functional capabilities for a drone of the future. The ZALA 421-16Ev2 has upgraded characteristics. The range of video and data transmission-reception now comprises 120 km and the engagement altitude is 5 km. The new vehicle will replace Zala 421-16E produced since 2014," Zala Aero CEO Konstantin Abashkin said.

Zala 421-16Ev2 has a new type of payload: 60-zoom video optical highly-sensitive camera, heat imager with Isothermal regime, and combined cameras on electromagnetic suspension which allowed increasing the altitude of effective monitoring to 2500 meters.

The drone integrates super-precision satellite positioning RTK Ready system without adjustment of onboard systems, and a 24-megapixel photo camera with replaceable lenses. New radio channels make ZALA capable of video or infrared real-time shooting along with super-precise positioning which increases operation effectiveness. ZALA 421-16Ev2 has a new type of battery which increased flight duration to 5 hours. Previous ZALA 421-16E payload, catapults and batteries are fully compatible with the new drone.

The first Zala 421-16Ev2 have been already supplied to the customers. The new drone will be displayed to the public at Russian and foreign shows in summer.
