Draken has won $280 million contract for adversary air aggressor services to the US Air Force.

ADAIR services provides tactical fighter jet aircraft flight operations flown by contractor-owned, contractor-operated aircraft simulating non-western aggressor air for the 57th Adversary Tactics Group, the US department of defense said in a statement Friday.

The contractor will furnish, operate, equip, support and maintain tactically-relevant aircraft for air-to-air tracking, targeting, and ADAIR operations. Aggressor sorties are generated by COCO flight operations, to provide combat air training services that include tactical profiles, to include beyond-visual-range engagements, operational test support, dissimilar air combat maneuvers, offensive and defensive within-visual-range maneuvers, multi-ship tactics, merges, and flight.

ADAIR sorties will integrate as part of the Air Force aggressor force in support of ADAIR requirements. Work is expected to be complete by December 2023.
