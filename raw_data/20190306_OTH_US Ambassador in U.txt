The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine should immediately perform the full and comprehensive audit of Ukroboronprom, the leading defense enterprise in this country. Another important step is to de-classify the state defense order. Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine said this during the speech at Ukraine Crisis Media Centre in Kyiv.

'The government of Ukraine should immediately fund the full audit of Ukroboronprom and de-classify the state defense order to the fullest possible extent. This will contribute to transparency and fighting corruption in the defense sector. Turning the blind eye on the corruption in the defense sector would mean grabbing the food, medical aid and weapons from the arms of the valiant warriors of Ukraine. So the government should investigate and carry on with the corruption cases in Ukroboronprom and other places,' she said.

As it was reported earlier, the investigators of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutorâ€™s Office detained the acting and former directors of the State Foreign Trade Enterprise SpetsTechnoExport on suspicion of embezzling $2,225 million, according to NABU.
