In an effort to secure and control key points of entry, the Uzbekistan Ministry of Defense thought that extra set of eyes could be the RQ-11B digital data link Raven – an unmanned aircraft system battled-tested by U.S. forces for the last decade.

So they requested four of the systems through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The Security Assistance Command is DSCA’s executing agency for foreign military sales.

USASAC – the Army’s Face to the World – has delivered four Raven unmanned aircraft systems to Uzbekistan as part of a Total Package Approach foreign military sales case.

The $2.3 million case includes the four Raven systems, maintenance support, training, publications, spare parts and technical support.

The RQ-11B DDL Raven, manufactured by AeroVironment Inc., in Simi Valley, California, is a small hand-launched remote-controlled system that can be used for surveillance and reconnaissance intelligence. Each Raven has a wingspan of 4.5 feet, is 3 feet long and weighs a little over 4 pounds.

Contractor-provided training Feb. 4-8 at the Florish training area, Uzbekistan, qualified eight members of the Uzbekistan Ministry of Defense on use of the system.

Over the four days of classroom instruction and hands-on training received, the students were shown aircraft and ground control station assembly/disassembly and preflight procedures in the field; vehicle operator and mission operator menu screens and functions that are new with the DDL system; takeoff and landing; Raven DDL malfunctions and emergency procedures; follow-me mode for mobile operations; and relay operations, in addition to handoff operations.
