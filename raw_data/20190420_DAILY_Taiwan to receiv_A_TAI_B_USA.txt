TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The first batch of a total of 250 Stinger missiles ordered from the United States should arrive in Taiwan by the end of the year, the Liberty Times reported Saturday (April 20).

The NT$13.3 billion (US$433.7 million) deal includes the portable surface-to-air missiles, the launch units and training for the operators, but Taiwan’s own National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) will be responsible for the necessary target identification systems, according to the report.

The contract for the Stinger Block I-92F runs from 2017 to 2025 and covers 250 missiles in total.

Details of the project were still being worked out, including the use of technology by NCSIST, the Liberty Times wrote.

Taiwan’s Army already disposes of the Avenger Air Defense System, while Apache helicopters are also equipped with similar missiles. The arrival of the Stingers beginning later this year will complete the military’s air defense missile arsenal, according to the Liberty Times.
