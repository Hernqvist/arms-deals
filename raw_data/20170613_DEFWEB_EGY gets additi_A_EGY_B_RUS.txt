The Egyptian military will receive Ka-52K Katran helicopters for its Mistral class landing helicopter dock vessels, in addition to the Ka-52 Alligators it is receiving.

According to International Cooperation Department Chief of Russia’s Rostec state corporation, Viktor Kladov, as reported by TASS, Egypt has agreed to acquire Ka-52K attack helicopters but has not yet signed a contract.

“I believe that a fundamental decision has been made, the procedure of signing a contract is only a technical issue,” he said.

Russian Helicopters Group CEO Andrei Boginsky last month said a decision was expected around May, with the tender procedure at the final stage.

In 2015 Egypt agreed to acquire 46 conventional Ka-52 Alligators. The first, seen in desert camouflage, was spotted at the Progress engine factory in Arsenyev, Russia, last week. Deliveries are set to take place between 2017 and 2019.

The Ka-52 Alligator is a development of the Ka-50 Black Shark, featuring two crew side-by-side in a new nose housing additional avionics. The Ka-52 is in service with the Russian Air Force, which has ordered 146 Ka-52s while Russian naval aviation will receive 32 navalised Ka-52Ks. Production began in 2008.

The helicopter is fitted with four underwing hardpoints capable of carrying 80/120 mm air-to-surface rockets, 9A4172 Vikhr-M (AT-12) laser-guided air-to-surface missiles, Igla or R-73 (AA-11 ‘Archer’) air-to-air missiles, Kh-25MP (AS-12 ‘Kegler’) anti-radiation missiles and FAB-500 bombs. Fixed armament comprises a 30 mm 2A42 gun with up to 240 rounds of ammunition.







The navalised Ka-52K Katran features folding stub wings and folding main rotor blades that allow for easier stowage. Originally designed for Russia, each Mistral class vessel was designed to accommodate 16 of the helicopters. The two Mistrals were handed over to Egypt in June and September 2016.
