Egypt’s military has taken delivery of at least 12 Ka-52 attack helicopters from Russia.

Recent satellite imagery has shown 12 of the helicopters at Katameya International Airport outside Cairo.

Last year Russian Helicopters General Manager Andrei Boginsky said 15 Ka-52s would be delivered to Egypt by the end of 2017 and another 31 would arrive over the next two years.

The first three Egyptian Ka-52s were handed over in mid-2017 and used for pilot training – 30 pilots and 70 technicians underwent training in Russia last year.

In 2015 Egypt agreed to acquire 46 conventional Ka-52 Alligator helicopters. The first, seen in desert camouflage, was spotted at the Progress engine factory in June 2017. AT-9 and AT-16 missiles have been acquired for the rotorcraft.







Egypt is also looking to acquire navalised Ka-52K Katran helicopters.
