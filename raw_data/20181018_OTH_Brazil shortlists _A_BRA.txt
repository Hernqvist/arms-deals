BRASILIA -- Brazil has announced a shortlist of four companies for its Tamandaré class corvette program. The list includes ÁGUAS AZUIS, a consortium made up of ATECH Negocios, Embraer, and Thyssen Krupp; Damen Saab Tamandaré, a team made up of Damen Schelde, Saab AB, and CONSUB Defensa y Tecnolgía SA; FLV, a consortium consisting of Fincanteiri SpA, Leonardo, and VARD Promar SA; and VILLEGAGNON, made up of Naval Group, ENSEADA Industria Naval, and Mectron.

Brazil originally received nine responses to a tender for four new corvettes. Brazil would like the corvettes to have a displacement of 2,790 metric tons, a length of 103.4 meters, a width of 12.8 meters, and a top speed of 25 knots. The Navy would also like the vessels to be equipped with full electronic sensor and electronic warfare suites, as well as torpedo tubes, decoy launchers, weapons, and anti-air missile launchers. MBDA's Sea Ceptor is the most likely candidate for the missile system, while the Artisan 3-D Type 997 is expected to fulfill the radar requirement. Furthermore, the vessel must contain 40 percent locally produced content.

The downselect was expected to take place in August. So the announcement represents a delay of a few months. That delay will ripple to the final decision as well. Brazil would like the first vessel under the Tamandaré program to enter service in 2022. However, with delays already mounting, a delay of at least a year or two is likely.
