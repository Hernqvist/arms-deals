Goose-stepping troops were the highlight of the military parade held in Doha, Qatar, on Dec. 18 in celebration of the country’s National Day, China Central Television reported.

During the hour-long event, more than 5,000 soldiers in 14 formations marched in goose step, a signature move of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).

Before the military parade, they received formation training from the guards of honor of the PLA. For historical reasons, Qatar had relied on British drill regulations in its previous National Day military parades.

After the parade, Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defense Affairs Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah received the PLA trainers, speaking highly of their work and the results.

He said that Qatar is willing to further enhance cooperation with China.
