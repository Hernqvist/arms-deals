Saab announced on 14 January that it has signed a contract with the Brazilian Army for deliveries of the latest generation of the RBS 70 man-portable surface-to-air missile systems.

The Brazilian Army sign a contract with Sweden’s Saab Dynamics to buy RBS 70 NG – the latest generation of the RBS 70 man-portable air defense system.

In addition to the RBS 70 NG system, the order also includes training systems, camouflage systems and other associated equipment. This is the Brazilian Army’s first order of the latest RBS 70 NG version and marks a significant upgrade to their air defence capability. Their existing RBS 70 inventory has been in service with the Brazilian Army since 2014. The system had a big role in 2016 as it was a part of the protection of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

We see their decision to continue to select us as clear proof of their confidence in Saab’s state of the art air defence solution.
