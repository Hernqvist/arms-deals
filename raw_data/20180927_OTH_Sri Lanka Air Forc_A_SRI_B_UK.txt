The main hangar situated near the entrance, has a collection of vintage aircraft used by the SLAF since its inception. Some of these flying legends have been fully restored to flying condition by a dedicated team of engineers and technicians. The venerable De Havilland Tiger Moth and the Chipmunk TMK.10 are two of the many exhibits. Also included in the collection are two light aircraft manufactured by S.L.A.F. engineers. Four more hangars, each housing aircraft, picture galleries, vehicles, equipment, arms, ordinance, uniforms and even a mini-cinema make up the rest of the museum's indoor attractions. The car used by the former Commander Air Chief Marshal Harry Goonetileke and the armored limousine used by the former President His Excellency R. Premadasa are two exhibits which have a special historic importance.
