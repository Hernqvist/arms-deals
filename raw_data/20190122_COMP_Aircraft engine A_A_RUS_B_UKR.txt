Aircraft engine

The two-shaft turbofan aircraft engine consists of a two-stage low-pressure compressor manufactured using "blisk" technology (the blades are made integral with disk), an 8-stage high-pressure compressor, an annular combustion chamber, a single-stage LP turbine and a single-stage HP turbine, and a nozzle. The engine has a bottom-mounted accessory gear box.

The engine is designed to power the Yak-130 training aircraft.
