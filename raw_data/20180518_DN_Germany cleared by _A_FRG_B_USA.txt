WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has cleared the potential sale of three C-130J-30 Super Hercules airlifter and three KC-130J tankers to Germany, with a potential combined price of $1.4 billion.

The aircraft are meant to help the German Air Force conduct airlift, air refueling and air drop missions as part of a French-German allied squadron based in Evreux, France. The C-130Js would provide crucial air refueling capability to German and French fighter and light transport aircraft, as well as helicopters, according to the annoucement.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced that the Senate was notified of the potential sale on Friday. DSCA notifications do not represent final sales; if cleared by the Senate, the potential sale enters negotiations, meaning dollar totals and quantities can change.

Lockheed Martin, Ft Worth, Texas, is the prime contractor, according to the announcement.

Germany was cleared to buy the C-130J-30s, each with four Rolls Royce AE-2100D turboprop engines installed and four Rolls Royce AE 2100D turboprop engines for spares.

The sale also includes eight Link-16 MIDS Terminals, and eight AN/ALE 47 electronic countermeasure sispensers, eight AN/AAR-47A(V)2 missile warning systems, eight AN/ALR-56M radar warning receivers, eight MX-20 electro-optical/infrared imaging systems, as well as the AN/APX-114/119 Identification Friend or Foe Mode 5 systems and the Joint Mission Planning System.

The U.S. package for Germany would also include, of unspecified types: secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic equipment, night vision devices, support and test equipment — as well as related training, engineering and logistics support.

The Evreux-based squadron will have unrestricted exchange of aircraft, air crews, and maintainers, as well as technical and logistical support based on a common pool of spare parts and a common service support contract, according to the DSCA release.
