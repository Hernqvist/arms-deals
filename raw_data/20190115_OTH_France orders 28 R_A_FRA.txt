The French Minister of the Armed Forces, Ms. Florence Parly, visited the Dassault Aviation Merignac site on Monday, January 14, 2019.

Accompanied by Mr Eric Trappier, Chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation, she was shown the Rafale and Falcon assembly lines.

The F4 standard includes among other things, an upgraded radar, as well as improved capabilities in the Helmet-Mounted Display, it will be more effective in network-centric warfare (more data exchange, and satellite communication) and it can operate with the Talios targeting pod.

Both support new new weapons, like the Mica NG air-to-air missile and the Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM) “Hammer”, a precision air-to-ground weapon. The F4 is also able to operate with the Scalp cruise missiles.

Looking back to the standards of the Rafale, the F1 standard was the first version for the Aéronautique Navale (French Navy). These Rafale Ms were equipped for air-to-air operations, but lacked any armaments for air-to-ground missions.

F2 standard gave the Rafale also air-to-ground and reconnaissance capabilities. The latest versions, F3 and F3R, gave the aircraft nuclear capabilities and it can operate with the most advanced air-to-air missiles and precision ground attacks munitions.
