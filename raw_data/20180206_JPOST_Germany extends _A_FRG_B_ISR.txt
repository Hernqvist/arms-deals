US President Donald Trump delivered a special announcement on Sunday announcing the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a US Special Ops raid, explaining that the success could not have been achieved without the acknowledgement and help of other nations such as "Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq.""The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years," Trump began. "He died... whimpering and screaming. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him that were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and his three children."The thug that tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in total fear," Trump continued. "Baghdadi's demise demonstrates... our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long."Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump for the killing of Baghdadi, calling it an “impressive achievement.”Netanyahu, who released a statement within moments of Trump ending his press conference where he announced Baghdadi's killing, said that it “reflects our shared determination – of the United States and all free states – to fight terrorist organizations and terrorist states.”Netanyahu said that while this was an “important milestone,” the campaign against terrorism is “still in front of us.”Trump additionally clarified that no US personnel were killed in the operation, though one dog was injured entering the tunnel. He stated that the number of people killed on Baghdadi's end of the operation will be announced in the next 24 hours.He described watching the operation, which he saw along with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, and several other military and intelligence officials, as something "like a movie.""Today's events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists," Trump stated. "That also goes for other terrorist organizations. Baghdadi and the losers who work for him, and losers they are, had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases, they were very frightened puppies; in other cases, hardcore killers. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way; as a coward, running and crying.""Russia was great," he said, explaining that the personnel as part of the operation had to fly over Russian territory."I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us," he added.Yisrael Beytenu leader and former defense minister Avigdor Liberman wrote on his Twitter account, saying, "The US military's cautionary operation based on high-quality intelligence is evidence that the US government and the US security forces are the leading forces in fighting Islamic terrorism."Al-Baghdadi was a symbol of the extremist Islam, which suffered a heavy moral and operational blow," he continued, explaining that his death proves that terrorists are not safe wherever they are, "including Gaza and Lebanon."Foreign Minister Israel Katz also congratulated Trump on Twitter for the operation, adding that the achievement "is extremely important in the war against one of the most murderous terrorist organizations of our time" and that the assassination is "an important message to the free world that in a determined war, terror can be won.""There is a great urgency to create a no-fly-zone in northern Syria," said former justice minister MK Ayelet Shaked in response to the assassination. "It is imperative this is done to prevent the ethnic cleansing of two million Kurds, and to put radical Islamists in their place."She further clarified that such an act is necessary in order to "prevent ISIS from raising its head and avenging the death of their leader.""The world is a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gone," said former education and interior minister Gideon Saar on Twitter after Trump's press conference. "The United States has made sure he met the end that terrorists should meet. The free world must unite in the fight against terror."
