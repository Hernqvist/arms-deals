    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The incoming Brazilian government is poised to follow through on a plan to funnel oil and gas revenue toward new defense spending, leaving European shipbuilders hopeful that the country can afford its new corvette program.\n\nDirecting 2 percent of royalties from offshore drilling to the military has been a national policy for some time, but previous governments have never fully applied it, according to Eric Berthelot, who heads the Brazilian subsidiary of French shipbuilder Naval Group. Officials under outgoing president Michel Temer first moved to tap the oil fund and have so far forwarded roughly $650 million to state-owned Emgepron to manage new naval projects like the $1.5 billion Tamandar\u00e9 frigate program.\n\nThe government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who will take office in January, is expected to further implement the policy, according to several industry officials in Europe. They said Brazil\u2019s ability to pay for the program will be closely watched as the Bolsonaro government makes its first moves next year.\n\nFrance\u2019s Naval Group eyes Brazil as hub for its regional submarine business Brazil's launch of the Riachuelo attack submarine is only a first step toward greater spending on warships, including nuclear-powered boats.\n\nNaval Group is competing against Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Dutch shipbuilder Damen and Italy\u2019s Fincantieri. The Brazilian Navy and the four bidders are in the final stages of coordination before the proposals are due on March 8. The Navy is expected to pick a winner later that month, though it is possible officials will await the LAAD defense expo here in early April to announce results.\n\nThe Tamandar\u00e9 program is for four ships and an initial eight-year maintenance package. The warships are meant to help protect Brazil's resource-rich waters up and down its vast coastline, dubbed the Blue Amazon.\n\nEuropean vendors tussling for business in the same competitions worldwide has become a recurring theme, fueling calls for consolidation of the continent\u2019s shipbuilding industry to retain a competitive edge.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans are more divided than ever,\u201d Naval Group Herv\u00e9 Guillou told reporters at one of the company\u2019s offices here.

    "text": "A picture reportedly of Russia's Okhotnik, or Hunter, unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), appears to have emerged on social media. Officially dubbed URBK, or Udarno-Razvedyvatelnyi Bespilotnyi Kompleks in Russian, which translates to Strike-Reconnaissance Unmanned Complex, the aircraft has been in development for years in one form or another, with Russian aircraft design house Sukhoi leading-up the project. The photo that appeared on Russia's top social media site VK shows a flying wing UCAV on a frigid taxiway and looks to have been taken at a distance and between barren trees surrounding the airfield.\n\nVK.ru\n\nThere is also a second picture from a slightly different perspective focused on one of the aircraft's main landing gear.\n\nVK\n\nThe photos are reminiscent of the ones that came out of China showing it's J-20 stealth fighter for the first time in 2011. It is quite possible that the image was a deliberately \"leaked\" as the Ministry of Defense has touted the upcoming flight testing for the UCAV since the Summer of 2018. The craft itself looks fairly impressive and substantial in size with a hardy landing gear that looks similar to those used on modern Russian tactical jet designs. The configuration appears to be loosely similar to something between Northrop Grumman's X-47B and Boeing's X-45C Phantom Ray, as well as other international UCAV designs. The blisters protruding from its fuselage are likely necessary systems for testing and not representative of a final production configuration. \"Next year, the Okhotnik will enter trials. The work on this project is a priority and it is proceeding at a good level. In the spring, we are expecting the first flight of this drone,\" Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko told the Ministry of Defense's official television channel TV Zvezda in December 2018. \"This is a serious task for us.\"\n\nIn November 2018, An unnamed Russian ministry source had also told state-run news outlet TASS that the Okhotnik prototype had completed its first ground tests, including taxying and a takeoff run, at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association's plant, which support's Sukhoi's research and development programs and actual aircraft production. Though it reportedly reached a speed of more than 120 miles per hour, the UCAV did not actually take off. The anonymous individual also said that the unmanned aircraft had accelerated down the runway and then slowed to a stop in a \"fully automated mode.\" The general weather conditions in the picture would match with the reports from Novosibirsk in November 2018, suggesting that this picture could be from those ground tests. The current weather there is also frigid and snowy, though, so it could easily have some time between now and then or even before, too. A previous picture purportedly of the Okhotnik had emerged in 2017 as part of an official Russian Ministry of Defense briefing slide. The much lower quality image did show a flying wing design roughly similar to the unmanned aircraft in the new pictures. The caption to the 2017 image had described the aircraft as \"Okhotnik-B,\" suggesting there may be or have been multiple subvariants or configurations over the course of its development. It's most likely the earlier photo is of a subscale demonstrator.\n\nIn addition, in recent days, one of Russia's handful of Su-57s has emerged wearing unique markings showing the shape of a UCAV flying alongside the shape of Su-57 with a lightning bolt between the two. The bolt is universally used to show electronic connectivity and data sharing. A number of aerials are also new to the Su-57 in question, which would be used for data-linking between it and the Okhotnik. The manned aircraft could potentially forward that information to testers on the ground. Making the mission of this particular Su-57 even clearer, a shot of the aircraft from the bottom shows its digital paint scheme resembles the shape of a stealthy UCAV. The jet could be acting as a surrogate testbed for certain technologies that will go into the Okhotnik, as well.\n\nRussia's move to developing a UCAV that is capable of manned-unmanned teaming involving UCAVs acting as \"loyal wingmen\" to Su-57s and eventually other aircraft makes a lot of sense. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, has been actively exploring the concept which you can read about in more detail here. But for Russia, Okhotnik could help overcome known deficiencies in the Su-57 design, which you can read about in detail here, and create a team that is truly more than the sum of its parts. This is in addition to using the UCAV as an independent asset or networked with other UCAVs for strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare missions. Separately, the MiG company has also been working on their own stealthy UCAV, known as Skat, or Manta Ray, the present status of which is unclear. There are also unconfirmed reports that this project may have helped inform the development of Okhotnik. Sukhoi and MiG are both under the umbrella of Russia's state-owned United Aircraft Corporation. Whether or not this new image is of Okhotnik, or some other design, if it is indeed real it is the latest evidence that Russia remains committed to the development of a stealth UCAV. China continues to charge in the same direction, as does India, and countries in Europe are following suit, as well. Meanwhile, the United States continues to act as if this game-changing technology doesn't even exist, at least publically, even though they proved it was incredibly promising a decade and a half ago. You can read all about this history and the odd paradox it that exist because of it in this past special feature of ours. If Sukhoi intends to keep to its previously reported schedule and have Okhotnik make its first flight later this spring, we might not have to wait too much longer to see how far the Russians have moved toward making their stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle dreams a reality.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: A $9-billion deal to codevelop a next-generation fighter aircraft with Russia fell through after Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) shot it down saying it either had all the technologies such a project would bring to India or was in the process of developing these indigenously.The mega deal, which would have put India next to the US and China besides Russia with a fifth generation fighter aircraft , has been called off with a decision to purchase the jets off the shelf in the future, if the need arises.Sources who were involved in the negotiations and are knowledgeable about the decision to let it go for now said the nail in the coffin for the PAK FA project was the insistence by DRDO that it had the ability to develop all technologies needed.The fifth-generation jet project was an offer by Russia to share and codevelop a new fighter aircraft tailored for India that would see significant percentage of the research being carried out in India and a complete transfer of technology.India has already paid $295 million to Russia for the preliminary design phase of the project. An official said the termination of the deal meant this money has now gone \u2018down the drain.\u2019Sources said that at a top-level meeting on the project earlier this year, conducted by the PMO, the Air Force expressed reservations on the Russian proposal meeting all its requirements.While these were being addressed, with suggestions by top officials that improvements could be made, DRDO was asked for its opinion on whether the deal would result in the infusion of high-end technologies in India. An emphatic response by then DRDO chief, S Christopher , sealed the fate of the programme.India has now told Russia that it would not be participating in the development part of the programme, but would consider purchasing the fighter jets in the future as and when the technology matures and is proven.The deal being negotiated was to make a tailored jet for India with four flying prototypes to be delivered by 2019-20. It also included production facilities for at least 127 aircraft in India.Russia has also offered to sell India 20 of its older MiG-29 fighter jets to boost the declining fighter strength for a little over Rs 2000 crore. A decision on taking this proposal forward is however yet to be taken."

The former three countries offered to supply new or used F-16s, while Sweden\u2019s bid was for the delivery of JAS 39 Gripen fighters.\n\nThe purchase will allow Croatia to replace its outdated Soviet-designed Mikoyan MiG-21 aircraft with new fighters.

    "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."

    "text": "Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody has sold L-39NG jets to Senegal, which are configured for light attack and training.\n\nAero Vodochody on 4 April said the President of Senegal, Macky Sall, during national Independence Day celebrations, announced the purchase of the four L-39NGs.\n\nThe contract will also cover the training of pilots, including conversion, instructor and combat training, maintenance personnel training, spare parts, ground support equipment and logistic support services.\n\nSenegal\u2019s air force has few fixed wing combat aircraft, its most significant purchase being Super Tucanos in 2013. It has several Mi-35P Hind attack helicopters in service.\n\n\u201cThe L-39NG aircraft is the new future of Aero Vodochody, the company that has been producing proprietary aircraft since 1919. The L-39NG is based on successful aero dynamical concept of the current L-39, but is manufactured with the use of new technologies and contains modern systems,\u201d said Giuseppe Giordo, the president of Aero Vodochody. \u201cCurrently we also have two additional contracts in a very mature state of negotiation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn January, Aero started up the L-39NG pre-series production line. Aero is currently producing a total of four L-39NGs. The first and the fourth aircraft will be used for flight tests, the second one for static tests and the third for fatigue tests. The first flight of the new pre-series L-39NG is planned to happen at the end of 2018 with deliveries expected to start in early 2020. Full scale production is expected by 2022 with 16 units a year.\n\nThe L-39NG programme started in 2014. The aircraft is powered by a single Williams FJ44-4M engine with FADEC control and has five hardpoints for 1 200 kg of weapons (three more than previously). Other changes compared to the standard L-39 are wet wings without wingtip tanks, it has a 15 000 flight hour service life, lighter and stronger airframe and Health and Usage Monitoring System. The L-39NG uses 50% new parts and 50% parts taken from the existing L-39.\n\nAero Vodochody said that, after focussing on aerostructures, the Senegalese L-39NG sale represents the first international sale of new aircraft in 20 years.\n\nThe sale of the light attack version of the aircraft is the first of a series the company is seeking to close abroad after bringing in industry veteran Giuseppe Giordo as president in 2016 to help turn the company around.\n\nDuring the last days of the Cold War in 1988, Aero Vodochody\u2019s factory outside Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia produced a 250 of its Albatros L-39 training jets for Soviet bloc air forces.\n\nThose customers disappeared with the collapse of Communism as successive governments focused on building a market economy and steered away from arms exports, sending the industry into a tailspin. Numerous comeback attempts sputtered for Aero, which halted jet production between 2003 and 2015.\n\nBoeing bought a stake in Aero in the 1990s but sold it back to the government after failing to land new contracts. Czech-Slovak private equity group Penta bought Aero in 2006.\n\nGiordo has overseen the relaunch of the L-159 and has championed the next generation L-39 trainer. It aims to produce up to 26 aircraft annually over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nIn recent years, Aero sold its L-159 light combat aircraft to the Iraq Air Force and US aviation services company Draken International. Those aircraft were originally made for the Czech military in the early 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-series production L-39NGs will be delivered to the launch customer, Czech state-owned company LOM Praha. Besides LOM Praha, the L-39NG is also being acquired by the Breitling Jet Team and Draken International\u2019s Black Diamond Jet Team."

Several more rotorcraft bodies of the new helicopters are at their final assembly point at Arsenyev. In February, another batch of Ka-52 helicopters will be transferred to their operators,\u201d Russian helicopters said.\n\nThe first batch of Alligators scheduled for delivery in 2017 per government contract terms was transferred to the Russian Ministry of Defense ahead of schedule in December last year. In 2017, production of these helicopters will be more than doubled as some will be headed overseas, Russian Helicopters said. \u201cThe first experimental unit for a foreign customer has already been assembled and is successfully passing all tests as planned.\u201d While not specifically mentioning Egypt, the Ka-52 has no other known foreign orders except for the North African country.\n\n\u201cWe took all necessary organizational and technological steps at Progress to expand production in view of the forthcoming volume increase. Today, the plant is ready to produce world-class Ka-52 helicopters in a timely manner, for the Ministry of Defense, as well as for foreign customers,\u201d said Russian Helicopters Deputy CEO for Sales Vladislav Savelyev.\n\nRussia confirmed the sale of 46 Ka-52Ks to Egypt in December 2015. Russian Helicopters Director-General Alexander Mikheyev said deliveries to Egypt are expected to occur in 2017.\n\nThe Ka-52 Alligator is a development of the Ka-50 Black Shark, featuring two crew side-by-side in a new nose housing additional avionics. The Ka-52 is in service with the Russian Air Force, which has ordered 146 Ka-52s while Russian naval aviation will receive 32 navalised Ka-52Ks. Production began in 2008.\n\nThe helicopter is fitted with four underwing hardpoints capable of carrying 80/120 mm air-to-surface rockets, 9A4172 Vikhr-M (AT-12) laser-guided air-to-surface missiles, Igla or R-73 (AA-11 \u2018Archer\u2019) air-to-air missiles, Kh-25MP (AS-12 \u2018Kegler\u2019) anti-radiation missiles and FAB-500 bombs. Fixed armament comprises a 30 mm 2A42 gun with up to 240 rounds of ammunition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgypt will fly its Ka-52s off its Mistral class landing helicopter dock vessels \u2013 these were handed over to Egypt in June and September 2016. As they were originally destined for Russia, they were designed to accommodate the Ka-52K helicopter. Each vessel can operate 16 helicopters."

    "text": "DEBUNKING THE ISPR\u2019s ANTITHESIS OF A PRECISION STRIKE AT BALAKOT\n\nHOW THE PAK ARMY\u2019s DG ISPR TRIED TO MISLEAD EVERYONE INTO BELIEVING THAT THE IAF STRIKES HIT \u2018NOTHING\u2019\u2014 THIS OSINT ANALYSIS UNMASKS THE DUBIOUSNESS AND CHARADE OF THE FIRST VISIT BY INDEPENDENT MEDIA TO THE JeM CAMP AT BALAKOT SINCE THE DAY THE INDIAN AIR FORCE STRUCK THE TERROR CAMP WITH SPICE 2000 PRECISION BOMBS ON 26 FEBRUARY 2019 Sameer Joshi Apr 11, 2019\u00b715 min read\n\n43 days after the Indian Air Force\u2019s strike at Balakot, the Pak establishment has finally opened the gates of the Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp at Balakot to international media \u2014 innocuously masking the huge internal damage caused to the various buildings targeted with a quick rebuild job, and the trademark subterfuge of the spin doctors at the ISPR \u2014 led from the front by the wily Major General Asif Ghafoor himself, who unfortunately now carries the ignominy of having been caught lying on umpteen occasions in the last few days. Living up to his reputation, Major General Ghafoor took the visitors everywhere \u2014 except the targets that India hit; masking his visit well with the famed ISPR doctrine of \u2018delay, confuse and deny\u2019.\n\nAbout a Black Hole\n\nHumanity got its first glimpse this Wednesday, the 10th of April of the cosmic place of no return \u2014 A black hole, located far away in the Messier 87 galaxy, which is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo galaxy cluster. And it\u2019s as hot, as violent and as beautiful as science fiction imagined it to be.\n\nMuch closer to us at Jabba top, Balakot in Pakistan; Major General Asif Ghafoor, the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and chief spokesperson of Pakistan Armed Forces, gave the world a glimpse of another black hole \u2014 which 43 days after the Indian Air Forces\u2019s Mirage 2000 strike \u2014 has awe-aspiringly swallowed all signs of the internal mayhem and destruction caused by the 1000 kg Spice 2000 bunker busting munition. Since then, a hardcore terror training camp has miraculously transformed itself into a Pak Army supported surreal visage of peace and harmony, where young children and students gain the Taleem ul Quran.\n\nReputedly the properties of a black hole are mass, charge, and rotation and all other information inside the event horizon is lost. Maj Gen Ghafoor had utilised similar attributes to unleash the ISPR\u2019s agenda much before this visit to the JeM camp by media and international observers \u2014 mass: his 20\u201330,000 fake ISPR handles on social media created a huge repository of fake news, narration and related content within a short time after the IAF strikes on 26 February; charge: the content propagated a blitzkrieg of the false narration, which effectively vitiated ability of neutral observers to absorb the actual Indian perspective, effectively charging up the atmosphere with a rhetoric of falsehood, deception and a spiteful debate; rotation: having achieved a measure of disinformation, the ISPR gave a spin to the event by getting specialist geospatial opinion on the subject \u2014 which was clearly aimed to demonstrate to the world that the IAF strikes hit \u2018nothing\u2019 \u2014 the event horizon being the visit by independent media and observers to the JeM camp \u2014 aimed at fortifying Pakistan\u2019s firm stance and demolishing the Indian Air Force\u2019s claim of a successful precision strike on 26 February 2019.\n\nFar from being the Pak antithesis of a successful IAF raid, the visit reveals a massive coverup by the Pak Army to the trained eye, the video evidence of which has been provided by none other than the head of ISPR himself through his official twitter handle. A thousand lies by the ISPR will still not be able cover the truth \u2014 especially since there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\n\nDG ISPR\u2019s tweet on the visit of a closed group of invitees to to the JeM camp\n\nRevisiting the strike at Jabba Top, Balakot\n\nThe IAF Mirage-2000s hit the JeM camp at Jabba top at 0330H on 26 February 2019 with the Spice 2000 bunker busting bombs. These deep penetration bombs struck their Designated Mean Points of Impact (DMPI) as planned and destroyed the innards of their targeted building with low yield explosives, causing significant internal damage and killing all with an over pressure shock wave. The detailed analysis of this strike can be read here.\n\nThe IAF has confirmed that it has immediate post strike synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, showing clear hits on the DMPIs \u2014 thus its an open and shut case for India.\n\nOSINT data shows 3 x Spice 2000 bomb entry points on the roof of the Mujahid Hostel\n\nHow the penetrator version of the Spice 2000 cleanly enters the targeted building\n\nSince the penetrator version of the bomb doesn\u2019t usually collapse the building (refer the above image), the Pak Army was able to replace the roofs showing the entry holes of the strike munition in the days to come. The international experts missed this out because they did not have high resolution imagery, enough to detect the three holes of the bombs. The incorrect analysis and info from which was thus used by the independent experts to validate their claims, some claiming it was a near miss for India. These have been addressed with appropriate counter views.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan Army reacted well in covering up the evidence of entry of bombs on the target within the first six hours after the event. This aspect was crucial towards giving the required \u2018misdirection\u2019 to the story by the ISPR in the days to come.\n\nVisit by media and military observers on 10 April 2019\n\nForty-three days after the Indian Air Force struck Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camps in Pakistan\u2019s Balakot, the Pakistani government took representatives of some Islamabad-based international media houses and foreign diplomats to the area.\n\nLets analyse the account of a reporter working with BBC Hindi, who was part of the entourage. His part of the story is tracked in italics from an english interpretation of the article here.\n\nThe BBC Hindi correspondent mentioned after boarding a helicopter at Islamabad, said they landed at a place near Mansehra. They passed through some difficult mountainous terrain for the next one-and-a-half hours.*\n\nThe convoy of media and military heads towarsd the Jabba top,\n\nNear the camp, the entourage had to trek for 90 odd minutes to reach the top\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the camp, the Pak Army directed them not to \u201cspeak too long\u201d to local residents.* Obvious question, if nothing happened there \u2014 why was the Pak Army putting restrictions on the independent observers to interact with the locals.\n\nThe visit started with a clear cut agenda \u2014 The information blackout was to persist under the farce of a so called independent verification. The ISPR has no plans of letting things go out of control. It has already burnt its fingers in the past when in the first week of March after the strikes, Francesca Marino, an Italian journalist confirmed through her sources that the death toll in the IAF strike was between 40 and 50, which included ISI personnel. She also stated that 35 to 40 people had been injured in the strike. This has been reinforced by the statement of Maulana Ammar, the younger brother of the JEM boss Masood Azhar, that the madrassa complex at Jabba top has indeed been hit by Indian bombs.\n\nThe screen grab from an Indian TV channel shows clearly that JeM was at the helm of affairs at Balakot\n\nIndian intelligence had estimated more than 250 -300 individuals active inside the camp before the strike. Details of actual number of casualties is not clear as of now.\n\nOk, back to the BBC reporters account of the visit to Jabba top\u2014 *When the authorities were asked about the delay in arranging the tour, they cited \u201cthe unstable situation made it difficult to take people there\u201d. The officials said they believed \u201cthe time to provide a tour to the media was appropriate now\u201d.*\n\nSo why now after 43 days?\n\nPakistan was under a lot of global scrutiny post the IAF\u2019s strikes because of the info blackout it had imposed around the Jabba top JeM camp. It was waiting for the right opportunity to reveal the innards of the camps to the outside world on its terms.\n\n43 days were needed for the massive coverup operation towards\u2014 disposal the bodies and the evidence, rectifying the massive internal damage in the targeted building, getting the locals on board and plan the next move. Interestingly, a quality work force was most probably pushed in at night to get the infrastructure sorted out after the massive internal damage in the targeted building.\n\n43 days is a good time to build an alternate global narrative and push in an agenda which suits ISPR. Basically, 43 days is a long time to hide an inconvenient truth. This is classic ISPR \u2014 Delay, Confuse, Deny!!!\n\nIncidentally this was the first formal visit to the area by media \u2014 and the trip intended to fortify Pakistan\u2019s firm stance that India had failed.\n\nAnyway, continuing with the BBC reporter\u2019s account, he said *the place (the camp) was isolated and away from human habitation.* Something to ponder over here \u2014 Does the Pakistani state open its Madrassas for minors in isolated places, far from worthy habitations? Remember, it took the media team more than 90 minutes to reach the place by foot and a good hour in their vehicles before that.\n\nThe signboard of the JeM\u2019s Madrassa Ul Quran on the turning to the JeM camp/ Wion news\n\n*On their way to the madrassa, which was claimed to have been destroyed by India, the media team was shown three different places. They were told that IAF dropped the payload there, and the correspondent says only a few craters and uprooted trees could be noticed.* The explanation of this issue has been dealt in detail here.\n\nOne of the 3 craters indicated by the Pak Army to the media team as from IAF bombs which missed the target.\n\nThe close up on one of the craters clearly establishes a HE warhead explosion pattern\n\nThe long and short of it is that \u2014 IAF used the penetrator version of the Spice 2000 on this raid. The shown craters were classic tell-tale signs of high yield explosive in the order of 400\u2013500 kg, as usually found on 1000 kg HE bombs \u2014 and NOT of a penetrator bomb, which would have dug in 3\u20134 meters deep in the earth, creating a huge mudpile around it with its high momentum and low yield explosion. The image below from a Russian bunker buster in Syria highlights the same.\n\nA penetrator bomb\u2019s site will show a result like this, which is unlike that of the Balakot craters\n\nUnlike a classic high yield explosive, the penetrator version digs deep and explodes a low yield warhead\n\nSo if the IAF didn\u2019t do it, who did it?\n\nThe Pak Army\u2019s lie on the Balakot raid stands exposed! Having carried out controlled explosions within the first few hours of the strike, the Pak Army changed the narrative to show that the IAF missed its objectives on Jabba top, little knowing that the IAF had used penetrator bombs instead of conventional explosives.\n\nPost entry into the complex, *The team was then taken to the hill top where the madrassa is located. The BBC scribe said that \u201clooking at the structure, it did not look like newly-built, or they suffered any damage in the attack\u201d.* Yes the BBC reporter was correct, because the large structure was never targeted!\n\nThe entry to the biggest building in the complex is seen on the left\n\nThe entire building was still intact, and some of its parts looked quite old, and in the adjacent mosque hall, 150\u2013200 children were studying.* Yes, this statement is correct, as also seen in the DG ISPR\u2019s video. The big structure and the Madrassa were not targeted and hence are of their vintage construction.\n\nWhat is noticeable is that all the JeM propoganda material in the hall as well as other places in the camp from before has been viped clean.\n\nThere is certainly more to this than what meets the eye, especially bought out by the NTRO\u2019s detection of over 300 mobiles active in the camp before the strikes, which cannot be these innocent children and their care takers.\n\nA whiteboard was also encountered by this media team, which displayed the message that the Madrassa would be closed from 27 to 14 March.\n\nA message denotes in Urdu that the Madrassa would be closed from 27\u201314 March\n\nIt is necessary to go through the following photographs of the JeM camp, which have been taken from an Indian Intelligence dossier \u2014 giving us the real evidence of activities happening at Balakot before the IAF\u2019s strike.\n\nThe same room in an Indian Intelligence dossier, indicating the JeM propaganda material\n\nOn the left is the entrance to the camp\n\nThere is NO sign of children as was visible during the recent media visit\n\nIn a statement on Pakistan news channels Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor said,\u201cVisitors freely interacted with students, children and teachers and saw for themselves that the madrassa stood on ground untouched with only innocent local children receiving education.\n\nI have a healthy respect for the professionalism of the Pak Armed Forces, but the DG ISPR takes the threshold of deceit and crookedness to a new low! Only the ISPR could have used innocent minors to deflect the the real purpose of the camp through a well crafted campaign of subterfuge and lies built around a fictitious account of welfare and peace in the region.\n\nMaj Gen Asif Ghafoor is at the forefront of Pak Army\u2019s disinformation campaign against India\n\nWhen Major General Asif Ghafoor, the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the armed forces\u2019 media wing, was asked about journalists spotting the name of Maulana Yusuf Azhar \u2014 the brother-in-law of JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar \u2014 on the madrassa board, he did not give a direct answer. He said they were looking into the funding of the madrassa, and focusing on the courses provided there.* Major General Asif Ghafoor did not give a direct answer, because he did not have a direct answer. How could a serving Major General of the Pakistan Army justify \u2014 that the man who helped fund this very Madrassa \u2014 was a major kingpin in one of the deadliest terrorist organisations of the world, which recently had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on Indian CRPF personnel at Pulwama, J&K on 14 February, killing 40 of them in cold blood.\n\nExposing the ISPR\u2019s lie on the Media team visit\n\nBefore we expose how the DG ISR twisted facts during his visit to the JeM camp, its important to understand the geographical layout of the camp, as well as the building which was \u2018actually\u2019 targeted by the IAF.\n\nLayout of the JeM terror camp at Jabba top, Balakot\n\nThe JeM camp has the above mentioned buildings \u2014 where the Madrassa complex with three clearly shown buildings, including the largest of them, is located next to the mosque. This was NOT a target.\n\nThe IAF has confirmed to the author that the main target of the IAF\u2019s raid was the Trainee Accommodation (Mujahid hostel) located at Latitude North 34 deg, 27 min, 53 sec, and Longitude East, 73 deg, 19 min, 04 sec; at the north edge of the camp. 3 Spice 2000 bombs landed precisely within 3 m CEP at 0330H on 26 February on the roof of this building.\n\nThe DG ISPR, Major General Asif Ghafoor has blatantly fooled the world and the independent media group \u2014 by conducting their visit to the JeM camp under a bundle of, pardon me for using the word a thousandth time \u2014 lies!!!\n\nThe DG ISPR conducted the visit of the independent observers to the JeM camp and \u2014 DID NOT show them the targeted building, which in spite of a speedy rebuild if there was one, would have left innocuous signs of a major trauma like a bomb hit. To reinforce Pakistan\u2019s version of the narrative \u2014 that the IAF strikes have failed, the DG ISPR took the team only to the Madrassa buildings as is evident from the video posted on twitter. These had not been targeted by the IAF, hence would be in their original state \u2014 which Major General Asif Ghafoor pivoted around to prove to the world \u2014 that they had not been hit by the IAF. Only the ISPR can lie with such a panache right under the noses of independent observers from various other nations, intimidating and demeaning the intelligence and dignity of most of them. It is evident that No member of the team was allowed to conduct any manner of meaningful independent verification by speaking to the locals or roam around freely in the camp \u2014 especially near the targeted building. The Pak Army showed the craters of the IAF\u2019s missed bombs, which are not in sync with the penetrator bombs used by the IAF to target Jabba top on 26 February. Obviously, these were controlled explosions carried out by Pak Army to mislead the world \u2014 Another lie exposed. The DG ISPR clouded the visit by displaying minor children as part of his plot in an attempt to spin a new narrative regarding their studies and care in this remote region. About 150 students, aged 12\u201313, were present inside the seminary building and were being taught Quran, when the group reached inside the madrassa. This was the first formal visit to the area by foreign media \u2014 The aim of the trip was to fortify Pakistan\u2019s firm stance that India had failed! However no meaningful member from the Indian media was invited to be part of this entourage, diluting the very purpose of the visit. As someone who tracks the Major General\u2019s activities well, tweeted -\n\nThe ISPR\u2019s failed Antithesis of a successful strike\n\nIndian Air Force carried out precision strikes on the JeM camp at Balakot. Post that, ISPR has tried to hard sell a bunch of lies indicating that the IAF\u2019s offensive action has failed.\n\nThis antithesis involves a covert cover up of the events at Jabba top through a well executed plan. One question will haunt the Pakistanis for a good while \u2014 Why did the ISPR wait for 43 days?\n\n43 days post the strikes \u2014 the DG ISPR personally led an expedition with so called independent media and foreign observers to the Jabba top and \u2014 intentionally mislead them by asking them to examine buildings \u2014 which had NOT been targeted by the IAF.\n\nInterestingly like many occasions in the past, Major General Asif Ghafoor\u2019s lies and deception during this media visit \u2014 was exposed by his very own narrative and the video feed uploaded on twitter \u2014 which showed enough evidence on his intentions. This was corroborated by other members of the independent military teams as part of the group.\n\nIts high time that the smart alecks at ISPR need to take heed of the fact that \u2014 It isn\u2019t the original event that gets people in the most trouble \u2014 it\u2019s the attempted cover-up. And the DG ISPR has given far more \u2014 than what he has gained from the affair since the Balakot strikes, thanks to his exposed lies and rampant flip flops. Hopefully, the Chief of the Pak Army will take the matter in his hand sooner than later, toning down the unethical ride of ISPR \u2014 which is fast becoming the infamous ambassador of myriad lies and blatant deception, hell bent on creating widespread misunderstandings between two nuclear armed powers on the brink of an all out war.\n\nAs far as India is concerned, Thank God for our form of government \u2014 The media won\u2019t let there be any cover-up.\n\nIt's evident though\u2014 that there will be no Event Horizon on the Balakot affair any time soon.\n\nISPR is nowhere close to its Veni, Vidi, Vici moment on this matter!\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n***The author is an former fighter pilot with extensive experience on the Mirage 2000 and MiG 21 aircraft of the IAF.

    "text": "Turkey has started to receive the second batch of CH-47 Chinook heavy transportation helicopters from the U.S., despite the ongoing crisis with the country regarding delivery of F-35 jets.\n\nThe Presidency of the Defense Industry announced that the first of five helicopters, part of the second delivery of Chinooks, entered the inventory of the Turkish Military on Saturday.\n\nThe initial agreement with Boeing, an American multinational corporation, on the purchase of 11 CH-47 helicopters in 2011 first delivered six helicopters in 2016.\n\nThe move came amid U.S. efforts to delay delivery of F-35s to Turkey. In early August, U.S. President Donald Trump approved a defense budget law delaying delivery of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets to Turkey. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), quickly approved by Congress, prohibits F-35 sales to Turkey until the Pentagon issues a report on Turkish-American relations in 90 days.\n\nStill, the F-35 Joint Program Office announced on Aug. 16 that it would continue to execute current program plans with all partners, including Turkey, and to abide by any future policy guidelines.\n\nTurkey has been in the F-35 program since 1999, and the Turkish defense industry has taken an active role in the production of aircraft and invested $1.25 billion in the aircraft's development. Alp Aviation, AYESAS, Kale Aviation, Kale Pratt & Whitney and Turkish Aerospace Industries have been producing parts for the first F-35 fighter jet.\n\nTurkey plans to purchase 100 F-35 fighter jets in the coming years. Out of 100 aircraft, 30 have been approved. The country took delivery of its first F-35 fighter jet at a ceremony in Fort Worth, Texas, on June 21. The first F-35 aircraft delivered is also the first fifth-generation fighter jet to enter the Turkish Air Force Command inventory.\n\nEach CH-47 helicopter has two rotors and two motors, each having 4,800 horsepower. With a range that can increase to 1,100 kilometers with the help of the fuel tanks, the helicopters can fly safely even at conditions of zero visibility.\n\nThe helicopters, which can carry 10 tons, can be used in war operations and operations with humanitarian and civil aims."

    "text": "TEL AVIV: As the US tightens its terms for financing the Israeli military, one of America\u2019s closest allies is beginning to sell its weapons to the US, instead of the other way around.\n\nMPR 500 Bombs\n\nJust last week, US-based Orbital ATK and Israel\u2019s IMI Systems announced a teaming agreement to supply a version of IMI\u2019s 500-lb Multi-Purpose Rigid Bomb (MPR 500) family of munitions for the US Air Force.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this relationship will lead to future product enhancements and additional opportunities for Orbital ATK and IMI Systems to collaborate,\u201d said Pat Nolan, vice president and general manager of missile products at Orbital\u2019s Defense Systems Group.\n\nThe MPR-500 is used on several different Israeli fighter aircraft. In conjunction with GPS or laser guidance, it\u2019s designed to improve strikes in dense urban environments and in close proximity to friendly forces, while reducing collateral damage and risk to non-combatants. The new bomb is designed to penetrate multiple floors and detonate its fragmenting high-explosive warhead inside buildings, destroying hidden targets. That allows planners to target a specific floor, while leaving the rest of a building relatively safe.\n\nIMI says that the weapon maintains its structural integrity throughout its path; eliminating breakup or jittering that has often been encountered with standard GP bombs, which increases the risk of duds or collateral damage. IMI claims that MPR-500 offers over 90 percent reliability operating against such hard targets.\n\nIron Dome & Tamir\n\nA letter signed by 40 Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives urged appropriators to consider purchasing the Israeli Iron Dome rocket interceptor for American use. In Israel, Iron Dome intercepts incoming rockets, artillery, and mortar shells aimed mainly at civilian targets; since the US homeland isn\u2019t in range of such tactical weapons, an American Iron Dome would primarily protect frontline forces and forward bases.\n\nFor these missions, however, the US Army seems committed to its own Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC). However, the Army has test-fired the Iron Dome\u2019s Tamir interceptor from IPFC\u2019s Multi-Mission Launcher (MML), which is designed to fire a wide array of different interceptors. (See video above.) Raytheon has teamed with Rafael to build the Tamir, which kills incoming threats launched from ranges of up to 70 km.\n\nIron Dome has a remarkable track record: It\u2019s the world\u2019s most used missile defense system, intercepting more than 1,500 targets with a greater than 90 percent success rate since being fielded in 2011. I can say from my own experience that, during the Protective Edge operation in Gaza in 2015, when rockets were launched into Israel, it was very comforting to hear the sound of a Hamas rocket exploding overhead after being hit by Iron Dome.\n\nThe system is effective day or night and in all weather conditions, including low clouds, rain, dust storms and fog. It features a first-of-its-kind multi-mission launcher, which is designed to fire a variety of interceptor missiles, depending on the threat \u2014 similar to the American MML still in development.\n\nRafael is now completing development of the C-Dome, a naval system derived from the Iron Dome designed to protect ships from all aerial threats. C-Dome handles saturation attacks by engaging multiple incoming threat simultaneously. C-Dome components include a multi-round launcher assembly loaded with vertically-launched canistered interceptors, installed under the ship\u2019s deck.\n\nWill Rafael offer C-Dome to the U.S military? \u201cIf Raytheon makes this version a locally-made system, this option looks very realistic,\u201d a Ministry of Defense source tells Breaking Defense. Rafael refused to comment.\n\nEitan Armored Personnel Carrier\n\nSources in the Israeli Defense Ministry point to the Israeli-developed Eitan eight-wheel drive armored personnel carrier (APC) as another candidate. Israel recently approved the production of hundreds of the Eitan APCs.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said after the Eitan was approved that it would dramatically improve Israeli capabilities within a decade, equipping IDF ground forces with hundreds of armored APCs with capabilities including an Active Protection System (APS) to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.\n\nIn fact, Brig. Gen. Guy Paglin, head of the Defense Ministry\u2019s tank and APC directorate, said that the Eitan will be the world\u2019s best protected armored vehicle: \u201cIt will have excellent combat capabilities that were tested in the past year in all the combat (sectors), from north to south.\u201d\n\nThe Eitan is the first wheeled 8\u00d78 APC developed in Israel, with the prototype first publicly unveiled in 2016. The IDF plans to gradually replace its very old tracked M113 APCs with a new armored vehicle. A prototype of the Eitan was first publicly unveiled in 2016.\n\nThe Eitan will be fitted with Rafael\u2019s Trophy APS, and Israeli sources tell Breaking Defense that other weapon systems will also be mounted on the wheeled APC. Sources in the Defense Ministry say that it will make sense to transfer production to the U.S .\n\nWill this open the U.S market for a version of this advanced APC? A Ministry of Defense source, asked about this, smiled and said: \u201cProduction in the U.S of an Israeli system is a different opera.\u201d Currently the US Army is doubling down on its investment in a different 8\u00d78 APC, the US-built Stryker, itself a variant of the widely sold Swiss MOWAG Piranha. The Strykers are slated to get bigger guns, upgraded underbody armor, and US-built active protection systems. For its part, the IDF had tested the Stryker but decided that it did not meet its requirements.\n\nCould a variant of Eitan be built in the US? Already, many components of two Israeli tracked vehicles, the Merkava 4 Main Battle Tank and the Namer heavy APC, are made in the US. In fact, some 60 percent of the Namer is made in the US, including the chassis. General Dynamics is the lead US contractor, but dozens more US companies are also involved in the program. In the case of the Eitan APC, involvement by US industry is expected to be even greater than in the Namer project.\n\nSo when the amount of local currency available from US grants will limit the production of the Eitan in Israel, transferring the production to the U.S is an idea that is in the air in all relevant parties.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9eF22kVN46g?t=8s\n\nHero-30 & Hero-400EC Loitering Weapon\n\nThree years ago, Raytheon teamed with Israeli company Uvision in an attempt to get orders to supply the Israeli-developed Hero-30 loitering weapon system \u2014 essentially, a kamikaze drone \u2014 to the U.S Army, under the Army\u2019s Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile Systems (LMAMS) . The tender is aimed at the purchase of 25,000 loitering weapon systems over 15 years. If the Hero-30 is selected, Raytheon will serve as the main contractor, according to the contract.\n\nUvision also has a larger version of the loitering weapons system, the Hero 400 EC, unveiled last year. This variant has a unique cruciform aerodynamic design which, according to the Israeli company, delivers high-accuracy and reduces collateral damage.\n\nUvision says that the Hero 400 EC\u2019s electric motor enables it to loiter silently above a target, ready to instantly respond to threats. According to Noam Levitt, UVision\u2019s CEO, the system was developed to answer a growing requirement for a loitering weapons system that can remain in the air for extended periods, provide a substantial warhead effective against a wide variety of targets, and deliver missile-level pinpoint strike capabilities. Will that version also be evaluated by the U.S armed forces? Uvision refused to answer questions about this option.\n\nTrophy and Iron Fist Active Protection Systems\n\nOne system the US Army is already buying: Rafael\u2019s Trophy Active Protection System, which shoots down incoming anti-tank weapons before they impact. Trophy is the only battle-tested APS in the Western world, though Russia has used its own APS to great effect in Ukraine. The IDF has installed Trophy on its Merkava heavy tanks and now the US is buying four brigades\u2019 worth for its M1 Abrams, with Chief of Staff Mark Milley pledging to eventually equip all armored brigades.\n\nMeanwhile the US is testing a rival Israeli APS, IMI\u2019s Iron Fist, on its M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Installing APS on a Bradley is harder than on a tank, because the Bradley\u2019s electrical system has less available power \u2014 crews in Iraq often had to shut down some systems before turning others on \u2014 and the vehicle\u2019s capacity to take more weight is lower as well. But if Iron Fist passes US testing, which is not a foregone conclusion, it will probably equip the Bradleys in the same four brigades whose tanks are getting Trophy, and possibly many more units as well.\n\n\u201cThe intent is to outfit the entire heavy force, all of our vehicles, all the ground vehicles \u2014 the Bradleys, the tanks, any future combat vehicles \u2014 with active protective systems,\u201d Gen. Milley told the Senate. \u201cActive protection systems are manufactured only in\u2026three (countries) right now. (One is) Russia, which we\u2019re not going to get them from. (The others are) Israel and the United States, and the companies in the United States, they\u2019re not ready yet for full rate production.\u201d That could mean big business for Israeli firms.\n\nSydney Freedberg contributed to this article."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nThe budget allocated is far short of the money the IAF has committed to pay for purchasing aircraft. It will need a mid-year bail out.\n\nNew Delhi: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has projected that it may not be able to make tranche payments (akin to EMIs) for its past purchases in fiscal 2018-19, as adequate resources haven\u2019t been allotted by the finance ministry.\n\nThe projection underlines the crisis that an increasingly lopsided defence budget has brought to the defence services.\n\nThe IAF has been allocated Rs 35,755 crore for the next fiscal year, a sum that top officials say falls well short of the amount it has to pay for purchases made in the past few years, including for systems such as the Rafale fighter jets, Apache attack choppers and Chinook heavy lift helicopters.\n\nAll these aircraft are to be delivered by 2019-2020, but part payments need to be made every year as they go through the production cycle in France and the US, and training and associated activities commence from the Indian side.\n\nWith the allocated budget short of its committed liabilities, the IAF will need to apply for special budgetary sanctions mid-year, throwing its financial planning out of gear. Sources said that the Air Force could be short by as much as Rs 14,000 crore, but that special provisions will be made later in the year to ensure that all commitments are honoured.\n\nEmpty pockets\n\nSenior officials say that while every year the allocated budget is far short of what the services project as expenses, this is the first time in recent memory that it will fall short of the \u2018compulsory payments\u2019 that need to be made.\n\nIn 2017-18 for example, official records show that the IAF requested the finance ministry for Rs 62,049 crore under the capital head, as it had planned to make payments for the Rafale fighter jets and associated components. However, given financial constraints, the service was allotted just 54 per cent of this sum (Rs 33,570 crore).\n\nAs reported by ThePrint, the Indian defence budget is now dangerously skewed as the revenue bill has zoomed over the years. The sustained manpower-intensive nature of the services has resulted in a situation where resources available for modernisation of the forces are far outstripped by the allocations required for paying salaries and pensions to soldiers.\n\nReports of the parliamentary standing committee on defence show a steady decline in the capital budget of the defence ministry. From 2007, when the ministry spent 41 per cent of its money on capital expenses, the ratio was down to 32 per cent in 2016-17.\n\nA shrinking capital budget means that the money available to initiate new purchases has reduced \u2013 in the case of the Army, for example, the money available for new purchases in 2016-17 was Rs 2,080 crore, or just 14 per cent of its total capital share.\n\nWhat can be done to fix this?\n\nThe parliamentary standing committee on defence, headed by BJP veteran Maj. Gen. (retd) B.C. Khanduri, has been a strong advocate of creating a non-lapsable, rollover fund for modernisation of the armed forces.\n\nThis would collect all unspent amounts from the defence capital budget at the end of a financial year into a corpus that can be used for future purchases.\n\nWhile this concept was given a go ahead by the defence ministry last year, the finance ministry has resisted all moves to set it up. Sources said that the standing committee is set to make a fresh bid to set up this fund in its next reports that are to be tabled in Parliament shortly.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "The Council of Ministers on Friday approved a draft budget for 2018, which calls for significant increases in government spending. Jenni Reid\n\nGovernment proposes $6B budget for 2018\n\nThe Council of Ministers on Friday approved a national budget for next year that calls for more than $6 billion in spending, the largest increase ever proposed for the Kingdom, with big boosts for education, defence and the arts.\n\nIn an executive summary of the draft law released on Friday, the Council of Ministers proposes raising the budget by nearly $1 billion, stating that the budget increases are necessary to run the Senate and national elections next year and to improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe royal government must ensure both elections will be smooth, orderly, correct, free and fair,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn addition, the money is also needed \u201cto ensure defence, peace and social stability\u201d in order to prevent \u201cany tricks and any kinds of attempts to make the country fall into chaos and instability\u201d.\n\nThe proposal will go to the National Assembly by the end of the week \u2013 the second time in as many years that the legislative body is forced to decide the budget amid significant political turmoil.\n\nCambodia National Rescue Party President Party President Kem Sokha is currently in pretrial detention on \u201ctreason\u201d charges, while Prime Minister Hun Sen has alleged the party as a whole is involved in a plot to topple the CPP-led government.\n\nLast year, the CPP-controlled National Assembly voted in favour of a $5 billion budget for 2017 in the absence of CNRP lawmakers, who boycotted in protest of a number of politically charged legal cases against their colleagues.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, the Ministry of Education will see the single biggest funding boost, of roughly $167 million, or 24 percent. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Health are also set to receive sizeable increases of 17 and 15 percent, respectively, or $80 million and $63 million.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts would see the single largest percentage increase, more than doubling from $20 million this year to a proposed budget of $47 million.\n\nReached yesterday, CNRP lawmaker Mao Monyvann said he had not yet seen the full budget but $6 billion seemed to be \u201ctoo much\u201d. He said the focus of the budget-makers should be on increasing funding transparency and boosting education.\n\n\u201cTo stay within budget, we suggest more transparency,\u201d Monyvann said. \u201c[For example], before approving any government projects, please have public bidding.\u201d\n\nCambodia\u2019s budget process has been criticised in the past by good governance NGOs, such as International Budget Partners (IBP), for lacking detail and transparency. Since 2015, however, the process has improved, according to IBP\u2019s metrics, with year-end reports now produced for internal use and audits made available to the public, among other reforms. Nonetheless, full budget proposals are typically not made public before passage of the law.\n\nCouncil of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan said that the budget hikes were justified, pointing to needs in the education sector and for recruitment of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe need it,\u201d Siphan said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t need it, why would we increase it?\u201d\n\nSee last year's budget here.\n\nSan Chey, head of the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability Cambodia, expressed concern that the budget process is moving too quickly in an uncertain political climate, with NGOs and lawmakers lacking the opportunity for input.\n\n\u201cThe tense political situation impedes the opposition party from having the opportunity to check and evaluate 2018 national budgets,\u201d Chey said.\n\nAccording to the Council of Ministers, the budget will also fund several initiatives announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen in recent speeches \u2013 including pledges to fund salary increases for civil servants, pregnancy care for garment workers and tax breaks for people who earn less than $300 per month.\n\nThe council did not explain how much the government is budgeting for those initiatives.\n\nSiphan said more detailed questions about the budget would have to wait until the full proposal is sent to the National Assembly for debate. Instead of having the chance to give their input directly, NGOs can try to persuade assembly representatives, he said.\n\n\u201cThey could voice their opinion on what they want and what they don\u2019t agree with to the National Assembly,\u201d he said."

    "text": "Pentagon and Lockheed Martin Deliver 300th F-35 Aircraft\n\nF-35 Enterprise Ramps Up Production and Reduces Costs\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas, June 11, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- The F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] delivered the 300th production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the program's continued progress and momentum. The 300th aircraft is a U.S. Air Force F-35A, to be delivered to Hill Air Force Base, Utah.\n\n\"The F-35 weapons system is a key enabler of our National Defense Strategy and is providing our warfighters the combat proven, advanced capabilities they need to meet mission requirements,\" said Vice Admiral Mat Winter, program executive officer for the F-35 Joint Program Office. \"The 300th production aircraft delivery is a significant milestone that highlights the effective F-35 Enterprise collaboration across the JPO, U.S. services, partners and industry. Moving forward, our F-35 team remains committed to driving costs down, quality up and faster delivery timelines across our development, production and sustainment lines of effort.\"\n\nThe first 300 F-35s include 197 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variants, 75 F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variants, and 28 F-35C carrier variants (CV) and have been delivered to U.S. and international customers. More than 620 pilots and 5,600 maintainers have been trained, and the F-35 fleet has surpassed more than 140,000 cumulative flight hours.\n\n\"This milestone is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our joint government and industry team as we collaborate to deliver transformational F-35 capabilities to the men and women in uniform,\" said Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. \"We are focused on reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and ensuring the highest level of quality as we ramp to full rate production and sustainment of the operational fleet.\"\n\nIncreasing Production, Reducing Costs\n\nAs production volume increases and additional efficiencies are implemented, Lockheed Martin is on track to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, which is equal to or less than legacy 4th generation aircraft. With the incorporation of lessons learned, process efficiencies, production automation, facility and tooling upgrades, supply chain initiatives and more, the F-35 enterprise has already significantly reduced costs and improved efficiency. For example:\n\nThe price of an F-35A has come down more than 60 percent from the first contract.\n\nTouch labor has been reduced by about 75 percent over the last five years.\n\nProduction span time has decreased by about 20 percent since 2015.\n\nThe F-35 enterprise met its 2017 delivery target of 66 aircraft, representing more than a 40 percent increase from 2016. In 2018, the team is targeting 91 aircraft deliveries and is preparing to increase production volume year-over-year to hit a rate of approximately 160 aircraft in 2023.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nThe F-35 is built by thousands of men and women in America and around the world. With more than 1,500 suppliers in 46 states and Puerto Rico, the F-35 program supports more than 194,000 direct and indirect jobs in the U.S. alone. The program also includes more than 100 international suppliers, creating or sustaining thousands of international jobs.\n\nWith stealth technology, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, weapons capacity and range, the F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter aircraft ever built. More than a fighter jet, the F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data is a powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace and enables men and women in uniform to execute their mission and return home safe.\n\nFor additional information, visit www.f35.com .\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\nSOURCE Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company"

    "text": "During 2017 Russia exported some $15 billion worth of weapons around the world. This included African nations, which received an array of equipment from fighter jets to ballistic missiles \u2013 Africa accounted for 13% of Russian arms sales over the last five years.\n\nAccording to Russia\u2019s Kommersant newspaper, and confirmed at a meeting of the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation with Foreign States on 5 March, Russia in 2017 received orders for $16 billion worth of defence equipment, bringing Russia\u2019s order book to $45 billion. Most equipment went to China, India and Vietnam, which ordered helicopters, engines, and vessels.\n\nA number of African countries took delivery of military hardware from Russia last year, such as long-time customer Algeria. It received the last six of 14 Su-30MKA fighters; six more Mi-28NE attack helicopters (42 were ordered in 2013) and T-90SA tanks (out of an order for 200).\n\nAlthough not mentioned by the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation, Algeria has also recently acquired TOS-1 rocket launchers and Buk-M2E surface-to-air missiles and ordered BMPT Terminator tank support vehicles from Russia, while it is expecting delivery of Kilo class submarines.\n\nAlgeria\u2019s receipt of four Iskander-E short range ballistic missiles was confirmed. The system has a range of around 300 km with a 480 kg warhead (fragmentation, blast fragmentation or penetration warheads). Each launch vehicle carries two missiles and each missile regiment includes around thirty vehicles (launchers, loaders, command, logistics vehicles etc.). Algeria is the second export customer for the system after Armenia.\n\nEgypt is another important African customer, and in 2017 began receiving the first of 46 MiG-29M/M2 fighters that were ordered in December 2015 \u2013 15 were delivered last year. Egypt also received 19 Ka-52 attack helicopters, out of an order for 46 for the Egyptian Air Force. The country has yet to decide on ordering the navalised Ka-52K for the Egyptian Navy\u2019s Mistral class landing helicopter docks (LHDs).\n\nAlthough not mentioned by the Commission, Russia last year also began delivering S-300VM missiles to Egypt and AT-9 and AT-16 anti-tank missiles for its Ka-52s. It has expressed interest in T-90 tanks and Buyan class corvettes.\n\nOther deliveries to the continent in 2017 included a single Mi-17V-5 to Kenya (for its police); two Mi-35Ms to Nigeria (out of 12 ordered in September 2015); two Mi-35Ms to Mali (apparently two more are on order for delivery by 2019) and the first of 18 refurbished Su-30Ks to Angola (originally the order was for 12 but another six ex-Indian Air Force examples have been added).\n\nAnother contract that was confirmed was for two Pantsyr-S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) air defence systems for Equatorial Guinea. This is armed with twelve 57E6 surface-to-air guided missiles and two 2A38M30-millimetre automatic guns developed from the two-barreled 30mm GSh-30 gun.\n\nNot mentioned by the Commission was an order announced in August last year for two Mi-171Sh armed helicopters for Burkina Faso\u2019s military.\n\nAccording to Kommersant, Russia expects its 2018 order book to be roughly the same as last year, although possibly a bit lighter due to American sanctions.\n\n\u201cRussia matches high standards and confirms its status of one of the leading providers on the world weapons market,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week. \u201cThe scope of our military-technical cooperation keeps growing in geographic terms steadily. The number of partners has already exceeded one hundred countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia is the second largest arms exporter after the United States, with a 22% share of the market between 2013 and 2017, compared to the US share of 34%. Third on the list is France with a 6.7% share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian exports of major weapons decreased by 7.1% between 2008\u201312 and 2013\u201317, SIPRI said. \u201cThe fall was largely due to reductions in deliveries to some of its main recipients. Deliveries to Algeria and China, for example, continued throughout 2013\u201317 but were at lower levels than the previous five-year period. Weapons remain on order from Russia for both countries. In addition, while Russia made significant deliveries to Venezuela in 2013, deliveries dropped to nil for the period 2015\u201317.\n\n\u201cRussia has fewer arms export destinations than the USA. In 2013\u201317 Russia delivered major weapons to 47 states and to rebel forces in Ukraine. A total of 58% of Russia\u2019s arms exports went to its top three recipients in 2013\u201317: India, China and Vietnam accounted for 35, 12 and 10%, respectively. At the regional level, Asia and Oceania accounted for 66% of Russian arms exports in 2013\u201317, Africa for 13%, the Middle East for 11%, Europe for 6.2% and the Americas for 4.2%,\u201d SIPRI said."

He asked the session to make a record of the project, which it did.With the president\u2019s approval, the fund can be appropriated without approval from Parliament.Fencing was built along 204 km of Myanmar\u2019s 295-km border with Bangladesh in three phases between 2009 and 2015.\u201cIn phase four, an 11.5-mile [18.5-km] fence was put up along the border during the 2016-17 fiscal year. Another 3.2-mile Y-shaped fence topped with barbed wire coils is being built during the 2017-18 fiscal year. Fencing will have been put up along 14.7 miles of border when that work is completed,\u201d Maj-Gen Aung Soe said.The 20 billion kyats from the president\u2019s emergency fund will be used to build a Y-shaped fences topped with barbed wire coils along an additional 18.5 km this fiscal year along with other related infrastructure including a 12.2-meter-wide patrol route along the fence, 161 reinforced concrete conduits and eight buildings including three warehouses.\u201cThe old fences are not strong enough and people can cross over them or remove them. However, we don\u2019t yet know about [the quality of] the new fences. We want better fences so that people from the other side cannot enter illegally. If the fence cannot prevent people on the other side of the border from entering illegally, it will be a waste of money to build a fence. It is the responsibility of the ministries to spend the funding effectively,\u201d said lawmaker U Pe Than, of Rakhine State\u2019s Myebon Township.U Pe Than, a central executive committee member of the Arakan National Party, said the project would be adequately funded but stressed that the ministries had to spend the money effectively because the fence was key to preventing illegal immigration and the threat from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.The Upper House also made a record of another 1 billion kyats from the president\u2019s emergency fund that the Border Affairs Ministry will use to upgrade two gravel roads connecting Ngakhuya to Zetipyin and the Kyikanpyin junction to the Kyaukpyinseik camp in Rakhine State\u2019s Hla Phoe Khaung Village. The two roads are a combined 18.5 km in length.Border Affairs Deputy Minister Major General Than Htut told the session that the road upgrades would contribute not only to the border area\u2019s security but also to transportation, health, social affairs and the education of local people.The Implementation Committee for Recommendations of the Rakhine State Advisory Commission led by Kofi Annan had instructed authorities to upgrade the roads.Defense Deputy Minister Major General Myint New said his ministry would also spend 5 billion kyats from the emergency fund on renovating 882 buildings belonging to the military\u2019s Western Command that were damaged by Cyclone Mora.\u201cThe damage caused by the natural disaster was inspected by proper teams and 882 out of 1,009 buildings hit by the cyclone will be repaired in the first phase during the 2017-18 fiscal year,\u201d he said.\u201cThe president\u2019s emergency fund was known as the reserve fund in the past,\u201d explained U Khin Cho of the Lower House Public Accounts Committee. \u201cIf the president approves, the fund can be spent without seeking the approval of Parliament. However, it is necessary to inform Parliament of the spending.\u201d[/B]"

But we will work it out and all countries will be happy.\"\n\nThe fact Canada has no intention of raising defence spending to two per cent was laid out in the Liberal government's defence policy last year. It forecast hitting 1.4 percent of GDP by 2024.\n\nSeveral times on Tuesday, Trudeau outlined the spending his government plans, including the expected purchase of 88 new fighters for the air force and 15 frigates for the navy.\n\nTrudeau shakes hands with Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis following a bilateral meeting in Riga on Tuesday. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nHe described the NATO target as \"easy shorthand\" and a \"limited tool\" and said Canada is always focused on having the capacity to respond when called upon.\n\nThe argument is not dissimilar to one the former Conservative government made when it faced pressure to ramp up defence spending prior to 2015.\n\nTrudeau received some political backing from Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, whose country meets the benchmark and has openly said it is prepared to spend more.\n\nHe said the percentage doesn't matter and it's all about capability.\n\nKucinskis seemed happy to have Canada's commitment to continue to lead one of the three NATO battle groups in the Baltics.\n\n\"Today all of us are a little bit Canadian,\" he told troops at Adazi. \"And we see and we feel that all of the Canadians have become a little bit Latvian.\"\n\nIn addition to announcing the extension, Trudeau revealed that the army will deploy an extra 85 soldiers, many of them logisticians and engineers to help run the battle group.\n\nThe additional commitment will play well at NATO, which is in the process of organizing a division headquarters to co-ordinate the operations in the Baltics.\n\nGen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top military commander, said the additional troops and the extension are welcome."

    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Japan\u2019s homegrown defense industry continues to secure significant amounts of contracts from the U.S. government, but concerns linger over the high level of spending on big-ticket items acquired via the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, and the outlook for Japan\u2019s push into the global arms market remains cloudy.\n\nFigures released by the Japanese Ministry of Defense show that over Japan\u2019s previous fiscal year, which ran from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, the top 10 Japanese defense contractors were awarded contracts worth $7.5 billion, with nine of these making it into Defense News Top 100 list of defense contractors. Two \u2014 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries \u2014 were in the top half of the list.\n\nAmong ongoing programs in which Japanese companies are participating are new wheeled, self-propelled artillery; armored fighting vehicles; and infantry fighting vehicles for the country\u2019s Ground Self-Defense Force, while its Maritime Self-Defense Force is due to receive more ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers, multipurpose destroyers and submarines.\n\nHowever, with concerns over China\u2019s burgeoning military might and the continued threat of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, there is unease that Japan\u2019s increasing reliance on the FMS program for big-ticket defense articles, such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ballistic missile defense-related systems, will reduce the share of the defense budget available for homegrown companies.\n\nAccording to Defense Ministry figures, Japan\u2019s spending on FMS purchases has climbed more than tenfold from $390 million in fiscal 2011 to a record high of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2016, although that figure is expected to drop slightly to $3.6 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the ministry.\n\nThe increasing spending on FMS has put pressure on Japan\u2019s policy of building up its domestic defense industry to attain a level of autonomy in meeting its defense needs. The policy has been in place since the 1970s, and yet FMS acquisitions typically have minimal local industry participation.\n\nThis policy of autonomy has seen Japanese industry build all of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\u2019s ships in service today, and until recently the country was able to build its own fighter aircraft, although that run ended when production of the Mitsubishi F-2, which is a heavily modified and enlarged Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon, ended in 2011.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

He said the best approach for Japan is for domestic industry to \u201cbe better integrated into any foreign purchase programs\u201d and to accept cross-national cooperation in the development of certain systems, in effect being selective in the amount of industrial autonomy Japanese companies retain.\n\nOne of the hurdles affecting Japan\u2019s drive toward industrial autonomy is the cost of acquisition and sustainment of indigenous products, which is higher due to Japan\u2019s small, niche defense market and its unique requirements. For example, Bloomberg reported that the country\u2019s Finance Ministry had recommended abandoning production of the Mitsubishi C-2 airlifter in favor of buying the Lockheed C-130J Hercules, which costs half of its Japanese counterpart and is better able to operate from semi-developed airfields, although it carries less cargo and operates at slower speeds.\n\nStill, the Japanese government is keen to support its industrial base. For example, Mitsui and Japan Marine United Corporation managing to secure contracts to build part of eight multipurpose destroyers, despite both companies losing the overall contract to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\n\nThe government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also relaxed laws regarding Japanese defense exports, making it easier for Japanese companies to sell defense articles overseas. However, some restrictions remain over which countries Japanese companies can sell to, and Japan has yet to conclude a successful defense export sale since the laws were relaxed in 2014."

U.S. SOCOM uses the SCAR-H, or \"heavy\" version, which fires 7.62 mm ammunition cartridges -- other versions can fire 5.56 mm cartridge.\n\nFor the .50 caliber ammunition, the U.S. Army uses the M2 Browning Machine Gun, which has been in regular service since 1933 and the Barrett manufactured M107 semi-automatic long-range sniper rifle -- the M107 has a maximum range distance of 4,400 yards or what equates to 2.5 miles.\n\nWork on the contract will occur in Oxford, Miss., and is expected to be complete by August 2019.\n\nThe total amount of the contract will be obligated to Olin Corp. at time of award from Army fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement funds, the Department of Defense said in a press release."

The milestone was achieved after the final flight test of the system, which evaluated compliance of the aircraft to civilian and military airworthiness requirements as well as system requirements verification.\n\n\u201cWorking in unison with our customer, we provided an innovative system that fulfils their dynamic requirements,\u201d said Dr. Rob Smith, vice president of C4ISR Systems for Lockheed Martin. \u201cWe worked with Finnish industry to maximize industry participation to ensure that the system can be maintained in-country.\u201d\n\nLockheed Martin\u2019s team modified an Airbus CASA C-295 cargo aircraft to accommodate a containerized surveillance system that rolls on and off the aircraft. A key attribute of this system is an open, modular architecture that enables future upgrades to be easily added. This approach ensures an up-to-date system throughout the life cycle using an innovative technology road mapping process. In addition to the reconfigured aircraft, Lockheed Martin provided the Finnish Defence Forces with ground stations and communications terminals to support the airborne system.\n\nPalletized systems that can be rolled on and off aircraft are offered by Lockheed Martin for a multitude of aircraft configurations. Lockheed Martin tailors airborne and ground system configurations uniquely to match customer specific sensor requirements and airframe needs. The roll-on/roll-off mission suite is ideal for customers who need an aircraft that can perform multiple operational missions, such as airlift and reconnaissance.\n\nFor more information on Lockheed Martin, visit: Lockheed Martin C4ISR Systems .\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services."

    "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 An escalating diplomatic crisis between NATO allies Turkey and the United States may risk suspending a $1.5 billion deal between Turkey and Pakistan for the sale of 30 Turkish-made T129 ATAK helicopter gunships.\n\nThe T129 is being produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries under license from the Italian-British company AgustaWestland.\n\n\u201cThe problem is related with the U.S.-made parts for which TAI will need U.S. export licenses in order to materialize the deal,\u201d a Turkish aerospace official said.\n\nThe T129, based on its predecessor A129 Mangusta, is a twin-engine multirole attack helicopter. The T129 is powered by two LHTEC T800-4A turboshaft engines. Each engine can produce 1,014 kilowatts of output power. The T800-4A is an export version of the CTS800 engine. LHTEC is a joint venture between the American firm Honeywell and the British company Rolls-Royce.\n\n\u201cApparently we shall need U.S. export licenses to go ahead with the T129 deal,\u201d a senior procurement official said. \u201cThis is not a technological or financial matter but is purely political at the moment.\u201d\n\nGo face to face with the TAI T129 ATAK helicopter at the Dubai Airshow 2017.\n\nWashington has sanctioned two Turkish ministers, and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium exports to his country. Turkey retaliated by sanctioning two U.S. secretaries, but the row has already sparked a financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has lost 81.5 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the year to Aug. 12.\n\nThe row significantly deepened after a Turkish court refused to release a U.S. pastor who had been in jail since 2016 on charges of terrorism and attempted to topple Turkey\u2019s elected government. Pastor Andrew Craig Brunson was later released from jail to house arrest, but U.S. officials are demanding his immediate release and return to his homeland.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe two NATO allies also have been at odds over U.S. support for Kurdish militants fighting the Islamic State group in northern Syria, as well as Turkey\u2019s refusal to follow U.S. sanctions on Iran, and Ankara\u2019s decision to deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense systems on Turkish soil.\n\n\u201cThis is a commercial deal (with Pakistan) with a country that has friendly relations with America. For Washington what matters should be the recipient of the systems, not who produces it and if relations are bumpy with the producer country,\u201d a Turkish defense official said. \u201cWhy should the Americans punish Pakistan for their disagreements with Turkey?\u201d\n\nA TAI official said a U.S. embargo on the chopper deal was unlikely because it would also hurt a U.S. company as well as two British companies and one Italian. \u201cThese are not enemy producers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are on the ally side. And we (TAI) are not being sanctioned by the U.S. or any other ally country.\u201d\n\nA U.S. diplomat in Ankara refused to comment.\n\nTurkey and Pakistan signed a deal July 13 for 30 T129 ATAK helicopter gunships. Pakistani officials say their own AH-1F Cobra gunships lack the capability to perform adequately over the higher altitudes of the Hindu Kush mountain range separating Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2016, Pakistani officials thoroughly tested the T129 and endorsed the deal.\n\nLHTEC\u2019s T129 engine also powers the 12 AH\u22121Z Viper attack helicopters ordered from the U.S. These are yet to be delivered, and such a timescale remains unclear in view of present U.S.-Pakistani bilateral relations.\n\nTo finance one of the country\u2019s largest defense and aerospace export contracts, Turkey offered Pakistan a $1.5 billion credit line in 2017, but the deal\u2019s payment terms are unknown.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is not always predictable. \u2026 He may wish to punish Turkey by sabotaging such a critical export contract at a time when the Turkish economy is badly ailing. At the same time he may also wish to give a message to the Pakistanis,\u201d according to a European defense attache in Ankara."

Currently the Bundeswehr is receiving portable launchers of the missile. New Puma IFV\u2019s are going to be fitted with the Spike-LR missiles no sooner than in 2018.\n\nAccording to the information obtained by Defence24.pl from the spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defence, the Bundeswehr has acquired a \u201ccertain number\u201d of the MELLS anti-tank missiles (local derivative of the Spike-LR system). The purchases are being still realized. Ultimately, MELLS system is going to replace the Milan ATGW system which is classified as a second generation missile.\n\nAt the moment, the Bundeswehr is receiving MELLS launchers in their portable variant. This type of weaponry is also going to be integrated with the Puma IFV, vehicle which has recently been introduced into service in the German Army. Implementation of this system on the German IFV is planned to happen no sooner than in 2018.\n\nMELLS system uses the Spike-LR Dual missiles which feature a guidance system based on fiber-optics and visible- and thermal-spectrum cameras (similarly as the missiles used by the Polish Army). The missile is capable of destroying armoured targets, including main battle tanks, at distances of up to 4000 meters.\n\nThe contract covering the delivery of the first batch of the Spike missiles for the Bundeswehr has been signed back in 2009 by the Eurospike GmbH joint venture company, with involvement of Diehl BGT Defence (40%), Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (40%) and Rafael. Integration with the Puma IFV is delayed, comparing the current status of the acquisition process with the initial plans.\n\nMilan Missile Launcher on the Marder IFV; Image Credit: Heer/Dana Kazda.\n\nSpike missiles are going to replace the cable-guided Milan 2 ATGW, characterized with a range of 2 kilometres. The Milan missile is capable of penetrating up to 700 mm of armour. Use of this type of missiles requires the operator to observe the target continuously, after firing. The said missiles are also not capable of striking targets that are located behind the obstacles. Milan missiles constitute \u2013 among other weapons \u2013 armament of the Marder IFV\u2019s. The Marder vehicles are going to be replaced by the new Puma IFV. Currently, Milan missiles are also utilized by the German elements of the NATO \u201cSpearhead\u201d unit. This weapon system is also being delivered for the forces of the Iraqi Kurdistan, who are fighting against the IS.\n\nSpike missiles, on the other hand, are widely utilized by the NATO armed forces, including the Polish Army. Poland uses the Spike-LR Dual derivative which is similar to the missile delivered for the Germans. Polish missiles are license manufactured by the ZM Mesko plant. Currently, the Polish Army uses the portable launchers system. Spike missiles are also going to be integrated with the unmanned turrets for the Rosomak APC. In the future they may be used by the prospective Borsuk IFV, based on a track-chassis. Back in January, col. Jacek So\u0144ta, spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Defence, informed Defence24.com that Poland is also willing to integrate the Rosomaks using the Hitfist Turrets, with the Spike system.\n\nREAD MORE: Spike Missiles For Rosomak IFV."

    "text": "The Algerian Navy will soon receive a fifth Kilo class submarine from Russia, as the vessel was completed in St Petersburg earlier this month.\n\nAccording to Menadefense, the Kilo class submarine Akram Pasha and the tug El Moussanid (703) left Oran, Algeria, along with the tug El Moussanid (703) for St Petersburg, where they were spotted on 12 April. It is believed they will be escorting the new submarine on its homeward voyage to Algeria.\n\nAnother Kilo class submarine will apparently join the Algerian Navy fleet in mid-2018 as part of a 2013 order for two new Project 636 Varshavyanka (Kilo class) vessels. It is almost complete and will soon begin sea trials.\n\nThe new submarines will add to four already in Algeria\u2019s fleet \u2013 in June 2006 Rosoboronexport signed a contract with the Algerian Navy for the construction of two Project 636 Improved Kilo class submarines under a roughly US$400-600 million contract. Construction of the first submarine started in 2006 and the second began in 2007. They were handed over to the Algerian Navy in March and September 2010 where they joined two Project 877EKM Kilo diesel electric submarines, which Algeria received in 1987-1988. The latter two were upgraded by Russian shipyards.\n\nThe Project 636 Varshavyanka (Kilo) class is mainly intended for anti-shipping and anti-submarine operations in relatively shallow waters. The tear-drop hulled submarine is 72.6m long, 9.9m wide and can dive to 300 meters. The design has a displacement of 3 076 tons. Underwater, it reportedly has a speed of up to 25 knots. The complement is 52 and the submarine has an endurance of 45 days.\n\nThe boat is fitted with six 533 mm torpedo tubes and carries up to 18 homing or wire-guided torpedoes, or 24 AM-1 mines. The type can also be fitted with four Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nThe outer hull is covered with sound damping tiles and its machinery as well as design is regarded as very quiet. Designed by the Rubin Central Maritime Design Bureau of St Petersburg, the submarine entered service in 1982. The type was originally built at the Komsomolsk shipyard and lately by the Admiralty Shipyard in St Petersburg. It is in service with the navies of Russia, China, Vietnam, Iran, India and Poland, among others. Some 50 have been built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria has apparently also ordered two additional Kilo 877EKM vessels, for delivery in 2020-2022."

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration, working to increase exports of U.S.-made weapons, has asked the U.S. Congress to review the sale of more than 120,000 precision-guided munitions to allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sources said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol building is seen in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2018. REUTERS/ Leah Millis\n\nPresident Donald Trump has thrown his political weight behind the arms export push to help job growth at home. Last year, his administration approved the sale of about $7 billion of the precision-guided weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat deal raised concerns from some members of Congress over American weapons being used in the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen and the deaths of thousands of civilians there since March 2015.\n\nThe value of the transactions under review now could not immediately be determined.\n\nRaytheon Co is the largest maker of the PGMs in the United States. A company official declined comment.\n\nAdministration and congressional sources confirmed that the informal 40-day review period to sell the munitions to the two countries was under way.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees have been briefed, and lawmakers have asked the administration for more information, which one congressional aide said had not yet been provided.\n\nCommittee spokespeople declined comment.\n\nSaudi and UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress.\n\nThe issue is likely to come up this week when Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, testifies before the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs panels for the first time since the Senate confirmed the former CIA director in his new position last month.\n\nTrump views weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States and has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in January 2017.\n\nHe has at times taken a personal role in pushing through foreign sales of U.S. arms, underscoring his determination to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, despite concerns from human rights and arms control advocates.\n\nKey members of Congress, including the leaders of the two committees, are allowed to informally review major foreign arms sales, and at times they have objected to sales and held them up for months.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of Foreign Relations, blocked major sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf nations for much of last year over a dispute with Qatar, lifting his \u201chold\u201d only early this year.\n\nHowever, if a president wants a sale to go through despite lawmakers\u2019 objections, it can only be stopped if Congress passes legislation blocking the sale. No such measure has ever passed Congress."

    "text": "In a bid to substantially enhance India\u2019s so-called stand-off weapon capabilities, the Trump administration in the United States has agreed to supply long endurance high-altitude surveillance armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are capable of hunting and destroying targets across seas and over land borders.\n\nIndian and US diplomatic officials confirmed to Hindustan Times that the Pentagon\u2019s decision to supply Predator-B drones to Indian military has been conveyed through official channels and that it is now up to the Narendra Modi government to take the final call based on the overall cost of India\u2019s drone programme. The matter was taken up during official level meetings attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale and defence secretary in Washington last month, they added.\n\nManufactured by General Atomics, Predator-B has both land and naval versions and can be armed with air-to-land missiles, anti-ship missiles and laser guided bombs.\n\nStand-off capabilities refer to the ability to strike without fear of the defensive capabilities of the target.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon had cleared the sale of 22 Guardian naval surveillance drones to India, New Delhi was insistent that given the costs involved, it was in favour of acquiring an armed drone which operates over both land and sea. \u201cPurchase of the Guardian drone through government to government route did not make sense as even if the unarmed drone identifies a hostile target over Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea, it will have to request for Boeing P- 8I Neptune (aircraft) to destroy the target. The time lag and effort is not worth the while. The Indian need is an armed drone which not only locates but hunts down the target,\u201d said a senior Indian government official who asked not to be identified.\n\nThe other Indian worry is about encryption keys to weaponised drone. Essentially, Indian national security planners are worried whether the US will also have control of the armed drones and could theoretically jam them . e US defence manufacturers have dismissed this concern by saying that India will have all the encryption keys for the armed drone.\n\nThis question, and the issue of the sale of the drones will come up before the technical team of Office of Secretary of Defence (OSD) policy arrives in the Capital on May 3-4, 2018 to discuss the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) with Defence Ministry officials. India needs to sign COMCASA and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for operating highly advanced US defence platforms requiring secured communication and spatial equipment.\n\nThe Indian and US officials said the sale of armed drones could also come up during the two-plus-two dialogue between external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman with newly-appointed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis in Washington later this month.\n\nWhile Indian national security planners are pleased over the US nod to armed drones, the cost, logistics and maintenance of the UAVs is prohibitive due to separate command and control centres and requirement of round the clock combat vigil."

Based on a T-72 tank chassis with desert camouflage, the Golan-1000 is a self-propelled rocket system that, according to Sputnik International, carries 500mm rounds. The vehicle carries three launchers for the rockets, which are fired from a remote control.\n\n\n\nThe Golan-1000 visually resembles the TOS-1, a multiple rocket launcher based on the T-72 that Russia has supplied to some pro-government forces in Syria. (source: Twitter )\n\nFurther details on the system are not forthcoming, though Sputnik referred to the system as being operated by the Syrian military's 4th Armored Division, which has played a major role in the country's ongoing civil war.\n\nIt is not clear what the system's range is or how many have been produced; it is similarly uncertain if all systems in existence belong to the Syrian military or if some are operated by allied militia groups. The Syrian military is said to have used the Golan-1000 as part of a military offensive against militants in Hajar al-Aswad, an urban area south of Damascus held by an Islamic State cell. The system's name is a reference to the Golan Heights."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nThis week, Indian media outlets reported that India and Indonesia are looking to deepen their defense ties following Indian Defense Secretary G. Mohan Kumar\u2019s visit to Jakarta in mid-January.\n\nIndian newspapers cited anonymous defense sources as saying that various moves were agreed to during Kumar\u2019s trip, including expanding military exercises, boosting defense industry collaboration, and deepening maritime cooperation, which includes submarine training for Indonesia.\n\nDespite the usual sensationalism that accompanied the reports, the drive to expand India-Indonesia defense relations is far from new. Defense ties have been a focus as the two large democracies have been advancing their overall ties, which were upgraded to a strategic partnership back in 2005. That brought modest gains in some functional areas, be it disaster management or maritime security or counterterrorism.\n\nMore recently, the attempts to upgrade defense ties have gained even more momentum. Following Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s trip to India last December, both sides committed to strengthening the architecture of their defense relationship by holding regular sessions of their defense ministers dialogue and the joint defense cooperation committee. They also said they would look to upgrade the 2001 Agreement on Cooperative Activities in the Fields of Defense to a more substantive bilateral defense cooperation agreement, indicating that inroads would be made in certain areas.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nIt is little surprise, then, that we are seeing more noise around what the contours of a deeper defense relationship would look like. All the general areas that have been reported \u2013 exercises, training and exchanges, and defense industry cooperation \u2013 are ones that countries would logically consider when expanding any military relationship.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nSome of them also follow in the pattern of what India already has with Indonesia. Maritime security has been a key focus for the leaders of both countries in addition to its clear strategic logic for the two Indian Ocean littoral neighbors, so close observers of the relationship had already expected that to gain steam.\n\nSimilarly, expanding exercises would not be a heavy lift since there are already a range of drills the two sides have, including the army exercise Garuda Shakti which has now undergone four iterations, or, on the navy side, the India-Indonesia Bilateral Maritime Exercise, first held in October 2015.\n\nIn other areas, talking about boosting defense cooperation is also quite apart from acting on it. Take defense industry collaboration, for example. There have already been conversations around potential opportunities, be it technology transfers, purchases of certain maritime equipment, or expanding commercial agreements between shipbuilders or cooperation in military aerospace programs. But it has proven to be a much heavier lift in practice thus far. Seasoned observers know that this gap between rhetoric and reality is true not just of India-Indonesia defense ties, but the relationship more generally as well as ASEAN-India relations as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, some of the comparisons we have seen made between New Delhi\u2019s ties with Indonesia and other Southeast Asian states like Singapore or Vietnam are a bit too much of a stretch. The defense relationship between India and Singapore is much more mature than those with most other ASEAN states, so the complexity of the exercises puts them at a different level, relatively speaking. As for Vietnam, the training aspect of the defense relationship is much further along than it is for Indonesia, despite the fact that there was a deal struck between the two sides back in 2013 for training and support for the Indonesian Air Force\u2019s Sukhoi fighter jets and pilots.\n\nSo while we are likely to see some gains in the India-Indonesia defense relationship in the coming years, one should also keep things in perspective whenever one hears talk of a \u201cdeepening.\u201d"

The only genuine candidates against Sisi in [the] election have withdrawn due to intimidation from the regime,\u201d the article said.\n\n\u201cWashington expects Cairo to return the favor for US aid by providing fly-over rights for US aircrafts, expedited access through the Suez canal for the US Navy, counterterrorism cooperation, and maintenance of the peace treaty with Israel. Putting these purported security benefits aside, the underlying issue is that Egypt is not playing the role of staunch ally worthy of over a billion dollars per year in military equipment and training,\u201d the article said.\n\nAdib, however, explained that Egypt is receiving this aid as a part of the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty (Camp David accords) with the auspices of the the United States. The US dedicates a large proportion of economic and military aid for both Egypt and Israel, Israel receives $3 billion annually, while Egypt receives $2.1 billion, made up of $815 million in economic aid and $1.3 billion in military aid.\n\n\u201cThe aid value which is $1 billion is not a big deal in Egypt, as the government adds the same value to subsidize the bread system,\u201d stated Adib.\n\nHe stressed that Egypt can stand strong on its feet without any US aid, and since the time of the regime of former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, nobody has ever twisted Egypt\u2019s arm: \u201cIt is not acceptable that every time something happens in Egypt that may not please the US politicians and institutions, they write articles threatening to uphold their aid,\u201d he said.\n\nAdib said that Egypt does not critically need the aid, as it\u2019s better to pour US investments into the country with bigger funds.\n\n\u201cIf you want to cut the aid, we don\u2019t have a problem with it, but as long it was a part of Camp David accords, the whole agreement will be amended,\u201d Adib said."

Bell was in September 2016 awarded a $34.5 million contract for the five helicopters for Uganda with work due to have been completed by 29 December 2017. Meanwhile, Kenya received eight Huey IIs between December 2016 and July 2017.\n\nThe UH-1H Huey II is powered by a 1 800 shp Honeywell T53-L-703 engine (replacing the original Lycoming), leading to an increase in hover performance in hot conditions and increasing the maximum gross weight to 4 763 kg. Along with the Bell Huey II kit installation, Bell Helicopter refurbishes the Bell UH-1H basic airframe to OEM standards (zero timing the airframe), provides a complete rewire, updates the avionics (including an optional glass cockpit) and offers a comprehensive selection of mission specific kits and customization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther features include rollover bulkheads, rupture-resistant fuel cells, wire strike protection and jettisonable crew doors. The Huey II has a useful load of 2 200 kg, endurance of 2.6 hours and max cruise speed of 196 km/h at maximum gross weight."

It will be supplied by the Gorky Zelenodolsk Shipyard, according to Shepherd Media. The contract is worth $180 million.\n\nRussian defence minister Sergey Shoigu said one of the reasons for Algeria acquiring the Project 22160 was its performance off the Syrian coast.\n\nThe 94 metre long Project 22160 vessels displace 1 300 tons and have a range of 6 000 miles at 30 knots with an endurance of 60 days. Crew is some 80 sailors.\n\nSensors include the Pozitiv-ME1 3D search radar, Pal-N navigation radar and Pallada and Vinyetka-EM sonars and weapons Kalibr-NK cruise missiles as well as a 76.2 mm K-176MA gun or 57 mm AK-220M gun. Apparently, the Algerian version will be armed with Klub-K missiles and Igla surface-to-air missiles. Two rigid-hulled inflatable boats can be carried on each side of the vessel and a helicopter hangar can accommodate a medium sized rotorcraft.\n\nMissions include maritime patrol, exclusive economic zone protection, anti-piracy, counter-terrorism, search and rescue, environmental monitoring and special operations support amongst others.\n\nSix Project 22160 vessels are under construction for Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The first vessel was laid down in February 2014 and was launched in August 2017 \u2013 it is undergoing sea trials and these included firing Kalibr-NK missiles at targets in Syria from the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria is receiving two new Project 636 Kilo class submarines from Russia, with the first about to be delivered and the second nearing sea trials. Algeria has apparently also ordered two additional Kilo 877EKM vessels, for delivery in 2020-2022."

    "text": "The Egyptian military has begun to receive S-300VM/Antey-2500 surface-to-air missile systems, with photos emerging of the missiles and vehicles being unloaded in Alexandria.\n\nA photo posted on Russian social media website vk.com showed several missile canisters and vehicles being unloaded from the military quay at the Egyptian port of Alexandria on 6 June.\n\nNews of the Egyptian contract emerged in 2015, when it was reported that Egypt had ordered the S-300VM/Antey-2500 under a roughly $1 billion contract.\n\nThe S-300VM uses two different missiles (9M82 and smaller 9M83) to shoot down targets ranging from cruise missiles and aircraft to ballistic missiles. It can engage four targets out to 200 km and altitudes of up to 25 000 metres. The S-300VM is the export version of the S-300 system.\n\nAs a result of the US suspension of some of its $1.3 billion in annual military aid following the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi by the military in July 2013, Egypt has looked to Russia to meet some of its military needs and has agreed to a massive $3.5 billion arms deal, announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2014 exhibition in Pretoria. State-owned company Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov told RIA Novosti that under the deal Russia would supply small arms, air defence equipment and artillery.\n\nRussia is supplying 46 Ka-52K attack helicopters to Egypt and 50 MiG-29M fighter jets, as well as 1000 AT-9 and 100 AT-16 anti-tank missiles for the Ka-52Ks. Russia also donated a Project-1241/Tarantual fast attack craft to Egypt \u2013 this is armed with Moskit/SS-N-22 anti-ship missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Russian equipment delivered in the last five years includes 14 Mi-8MT/Mi-17 helicopters and the EgyptSat-2 reconnaissance satellite."

    "text": "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) \u2014 The proposed 2019 budget for the Department of National Defense (DND) is \u20b1251 billion, \u20b149 billion higher than their current budget.\n\n\u20b1183 billion was allocated to personnel services \u2014 to increase the compensation for civilian and military personnel, as well as to provide for a pension increase for retirees.\n\n\"'Yun pong increase namin malaki, ito po 'yung dagdag sa second tranche ng ating increases for personal services. Kaya po malaki,\" DND Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said during House Appropriations Committee deliberations Wednesday.\n\n[Translation: Our increase is huge. This is the addition to the second tranche of increases for personal services, and that's why it's huge]\n\nThis \u20b147 billion hike is in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's directive in January to increase the salaries of military and police personnel, one of his campaign promises in 2016.\n\nThe hike comes despite a cut in the budget of other government agencies, such as the Department of Education. Its proposed funds were cut by \u20b151 billion, from over \u20b1580 billion in 2018 to \u20b1528 billion in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) seeks a 30 percent increase in their 2019 budget, with the bulk of it going to the Philippine National Police.\n\n'Martial law is working'\n\nLawmakers and defense officials also discussed martial law in Mindanao.\n\n\"Martial law is working in Mindanao. Although there are some pockets of trouble there like the groups of Maute, BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters) and Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Sulu. It is working in other fronts,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed getting good feedback from Mindanao citizens.\n\n\"In fact we get feedback kung pwede raw tuluy-tuloy na [it should not stop],\" he added.\n\nLorenzana had earlier said he is open to further extending military rule in Mindanao, beyond the two extensions Congress granted in 2017.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief-of-Staff Carlito Galvez wants continuous vigilance in the region, as the ISIS-inspired Maute group responsible for the five-month Marawi City crisis is still actively recruiting members.\n\n\"Nakita po namin talaga na ang ating greatest threat would be the ISIS-Maute group. Considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS talagang evident,\" Galvez said.\n\n[Translation: We saw that our greatest threat is the ISIS-Maute group, considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS, it's evident.]\n\nThe AFP Chief also said they can defeat the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) rebels in Mindanao as reflected in the number of surrendering insurgents.\n\n\"We are estimating that in two or three years time, we will defeat the CPP near in the near future,\" he added.\n\nGalvez also affirmed Lorenzana, saying Martial law helps in improving the state of security in the Mindanao.\n\nHe said from January this year, the military was able to neutralize 800 communist rebels, and confiscate 5, 504 high-powered firearms from a number of anti-terrorism operations.\n\nHe added, about 200 members of local terrorist groups have also surrendered"

They will be equipped with Indian-built radar, sonar, communication suites and anti-ship BrahMos missile systems, an Indian Navy official said. The ships are expected to be delivered by the end of 2022, the official added.\n\nIndia and Russia signed an agreement in October 2016 for the purchase and construction of four additional upgraded Kravak III-class stealth frigates, under which two frigates will be directly supplied by Russia and two others built at state-owned Goa Shipyard Limited in India though a technology transfer.\n\nA separate contract will be signed next year for the construction of two similar stealth frigates in India.\n\nThe 4,000-ton Krivak III vessels will also accommodate two multirole helicopters and will be used for anti-submarine and airborne early warning missions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Subsequently, Airbus will promote the aircraft to North American operators.\"During its tour, the C295 will demonstrate its advanced ISR capabilities as well as the platform's versatility and suitability for potential operators, especially in the Asian region,\" Airbus said. The company is also promoting the aircraft to meet regional requirements to enhance surveillance, search and rescue, transport, medical evacuation, and humanitarian missions.Airbus said the aircraft on display in Thailand is a model of the platform recently delivered to the Brazilian Air Force to meet its search and rescue and maritime patrol requirements.Airbus said it sees opportunities to supply the aircraft to the RTN, which is expected in the coming years to replace its ageing fleets of Dornier 228 and Fokker F27 Friendship patrol craft, which were acquired from the 1980s onwards.In addition, Airbus said it is seeking to expand sales of the C295 military transport aircraft to the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) took delivery in June 2016 of a single C295W transport aircraft, although it is understood that the service requires three additional platforms."

Armenia has increased it military budget for 2018 by 34 billion drams when compared to 2017, to 1.5% of the projected GDP or 246 billion drams, Atom Margaryan, the head of the Center for Innovative and Institutional Research, told journalists on Friday.\n\n\n\nHe said the increase in defense spending is inevitable for Armenia because of the unsettled Karabakh conflict and the need to constantly modernize the country's defense system.\n\n\n\n\"The increase in defense spending is prompted by the constant need to modernize and purchase new types of weapons. The public at large looks at it with understanding,\" Margaryan said, adding, however, that the increasing defense spending is becoming a heavy burden for the budget.\n\n\n\n\"However, this is the price we have to pay for our security and a peaceful sky over our heads,\" Margaryan said.\n\n\n\nArmenian defense minister Vigen Sargsyan said earlier that Armenia would increase its defense spending by 17% (24 billion drams or $50 million) in 2018.\n\n\n\nThe 2018 budget calls for 1 trillion and 307 billion drams in revenue and 1 trillion and 464.2 billion drams in spending.

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 France unveiled Thursday a draft of its 2019-2025 military budget plan, setting \u20ac295 billion (U.S. $361 billion) on spending, which included better barracks, larger orders of Army armored vehicles, and studies on next-generation nuclear submarines and airborne nuclear missiles.\n\nThat spending plan compares to \u20ac190 billion in the present 2014-2018 budget law. The Armed Forces Ministry sees the budget law as a \u201crenewal,\u201d as the government seeks to \u201cregenerate\u201d the services. A first phase consists of \u20ac198 billion in the present five-year government term, with defense spending rising \u20ac1.7 billion each year to hit \u20ac44 billion in 2023. That compares to the 2018 budget of \u20ac34.2 billion.\n\nThat expenditure is covered by the government spending cap, which seeks to rein in the French deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, as requested by the European Commission. France has pledged to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2025, a target set by NATO for member states.\n\nFrance would reach NATO budget target under top military officer's plan The funding proposed by Army Gen. Pierre de Villiers would help France reach NATO's budget target of 2 percent of GDP by 2022.\n\nThe second phase for 2024 and 2025 assumes an annual \u20ac3 billion increase, with much depending on the macro-economic performance. A government review will be held in 2021 to decide what to commit in the following budgets. A general election will be held in 2023, so the next administration will decide how closely it follows the budget law.\n\n\u201cThere is much pragmatism,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Lureau of consultancy EuroFLconsult and former head of the French defense procurement office. The budget reflected the Army\u2019s leading role in the Barkhane mission in Africa and the need for an overhaul of aircraft maintenance.\n\n\u201cService is very expensive,\u201d he added.\n\nThe budget law drew criticism from Fran\u00e7ois Cornut-Gentille, a member of parliament on the finance committee of the lower house National Assembly.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThe main effort is pushed back after the five-year term, whether it is budgetary outlay, increase in personnel or delivery of equipment,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTwo further setbacks were the Armed Forces Ministry carrying the full cost of overseas deployment and the lack of spending adjustment for inflation.\n\nThe Army and nuclear deterrent were seen as major beneficiaries of the budget.\n\nSpending on buildings and infrastructure for the services will rise 14 percent, seeking to remedy the poor conditions of the bases and family housing. Some 6,000 personnel will be recruited, reversing a previous policy of cutting the size of services. Some 750 staff will be recruited to support arms exports.\n\nThe Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement procurement office had already been authorized to recruit 80 staff for 2017-18 to support export deals, following a request that stemmed from the sharp rise in foreign arm sales.\n\nOn equipment orders, the Army\u2019s Scorpion modernization program will see a faster delivery, with half the fleet of Jaguar troop carriers, Griffon combat vehicles and Light VBMR vehicles delivered by 2025.\n\n\u201cThat is very good news,\u201d a defense executive said. \u201cThere was a sanctuary for Scorpion.\u201d\n\nOther notable investments:\n\nThe Navy will receive the first four Barracuda nuclear-powered attack submarines, last three Fremm multimission frigates and first two FTI intermediate frigates.\n\nThere will be studies on arming the air defense version of the Fremm with the Aster Block 1 NT missile.\n\n\n\nThe Air Force will receive six armed Reaper drones, the first European medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV, 28 Rafale fighter jets and 55 upgraded Mirage 2000D fighters.\n\n\n\nAcquisition of the A330 MRTT tanker transport aircraft will be increased to 15 from 12, with the first 12 delivered by 2023 and the remaining three shipped by 2025.\n\n\n\nAn annual \u20ac1.8 billion will be spent on concept studies on future weapons, including fighter jet, heavy tank and replacement to the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier.\n\n\n\nThe annual budget for feasibility studies will rise to \u20ac1 billion from \u20ac730 million.\n\n\n\nA total \u20ac112.5 billion will be spent on equipment in 2019-23, of which \u20ac25 billion earmarked for studies on the next-generation nuclear submarine and airborne nuclear missile. Orders for the H160 for the joint light helicopter were pushed back to 2022, with delivery in 2028 in the next multi-year budget law.\n\nFor intelligence gathering, there will be orders for six light ISR aircraft, and Musis and Ceres satellites to gather visual and electronic intelligence. The government will seek a 36 percent increase in the number of programs run in cooperation with European allies.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the U.K. will be considered a European partner once Britain leaves the European Union, a second defense executive said."

    "text": "Author: Abhijit Singh, Observer Research Foundation\n\nAt a recent press conference in New Delhi, India\u2019s Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman surprised reporters by stating that she saw \u2018no tension between the navies of India and China in the Indian Ocean\u2019. In response to a question about a perceived \u2018tussle\u2019 for supremacy in the Indian Ocean, Sitharaman downplayed the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) threat in India\u2019s near-seas, choosing curiously not to elaborate on the matter.\n\nNot everyone in India\u2019s security circles would agree with the Minister\u2019s assessment. Over the past few years, China\u2019s rapidly expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean has created anxiety in India\u2019s strategic community, where many believe China\u2019s naval activism has shrunk New Delhi\u2019s space for operational manoeuvre. Not only has China made inroads into India\u2019s traditional sphere of influence in maritime South Asia; Beijing has also leveraged its naval anti-piracy deployments for geopolitical gains by promoting partnerships with regional states and advancing a \u2018benevolent China\u2019 narrative.\n\nMore importantly, Beijing has raised its strategic stakes in the Indian Ocean. It is odd that China\u2019s anti-piracy contingents now comprise guided-missile frigates, advanced destroyers and special operations forces \u2014contingents suited more for high-impact \u2018presence operations\u2019 than anti-piracy missions. Since the inauguration of China\u2019s first overseas military facility in Djibouti, the PLAN\u2019s bid for strategic access in the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical littorals has been amply evident.\n\nFor New Delhi, the bigger challenge has come from Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean. In recent years, Chinese anti-piracy contingents have invariably been accompanied by a PLAN submarine. In the name of counter-piracy operations, Chinese submarines have gathered critical information about the Indian Ocean\u2019s operating environment and have spent an inordinately long time scouring the South Asian seas. The PLAN has been assisted in its endeavours by the Pakistan Navy, raising further concerns in India about an evolving China\u2013Pakistan axis in the Indian Ocean. China\u2019s reported deployment of a submarine in July 2017, at the height of the month-long stand-off between the Indian Army and the People\u2019s Liberation Army in the Doklam plateau, so upset New Delhi that India\u2019s naval leadership felt compelled to order permanent surveillance of the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical sea lanes and choke points by \u2018mission-ready\u2019 warships.\n\nIn its attempts to maintain a favourable balance of naval power in the Indian Ocean, New Delhi has drawn close to Washington and Tokyo. The trilateral India\u2013US\u2013Japan Malabar exercises have grown in scope and complexity with the addition of more combat drills, but New Delhi has been strangely reluctant to expand the tent to accommodate the Royal Australian Navy. It is possible India might consider entering into other trilateral arrangements (possibly with France and Australia) before assenting to a large naval coalition in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTo New Delhi\u2019s credit, it has stepped up its game in the Western Indian Ocean \u2014 the focal point of China\u2019s investment and infrastructure initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region. After signing logistical pacts with Oman and France, India has strengthened maritime ties with Mauritius, Seychelles, Mozambique and Madagascar. A visit by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to East African island states in April 2018 demonstrated New Delhi\u2019s resolve to rise to the challenge posed by China in the Western Indian Ocean littoral.\n\nMeanwhile, there are indications that Beijing may have been less than straightforward about its Belt and Road Initiative. The developmental blueprint is inherently \u2018dual-use\u2019 in character: Chinese-constructed commercial facilities are often structurally upgradable for military use (as witnessed in October 2014 when a PLAN submarine docked at a Chinese-constructed facility in Colombo), and the terms of agreement for port operations are almost always skewed in favour of Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nNew Delhi knows China is being smart with its influence projection in the Indian Ocean. Beijing has ensured that its warships do not threaten Indian interests in the Indian Ocean. PLAN ships have not challenged India\u2019s sovereignty in its territorial waters and have maintained a safe distance from the Andaman and Nicobar islands. China has limited its ventures to its Belt and Road Initiative partner states, who are eager to benefit from Beijing\u2019s economic and military assistance.\n\nYet there is no escaping the sense in New Delhi of a \u2018slow choke\u2019 of Indian equities in the Indian Ocean. In order to manage the India\u2013China rivalry at sea, some analysts have proposed an \u2018incidents at sea\u2019 agreement with objectives similar to the US\u2013USSR \u2018INCSEA\u2019 pact of 1972. While such an arrangement could indeed de-escalate a crisis arising from an accidental encounter at sea, it is not entirely clear how it would help in clarifying suspicions about strategic intent. The Indian Navy would be happy to sign up to a \u2018code of conduct\u2019 if it were to also apply in the Western Pacific, where there is an equal possibility of an India\u2013China skirmish. But that, presumably, will not be acceptable to China.\n\nAs things stand, the Indian Navy is intent on emphasising its pre-eminent status in the Indian Ocean. Even so, the task of constantly patrolling the South Asian seas is imposing a heavy burden on naval frontline assets. The sheer magnitude of the task has led Admiral Sunil Lanba, head of the Indian Navy, to observe that even though Indian warships were monitoring the pattern and periodicity of extra-regional deployments, it is clear the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy is here to stay in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is possible the Admiral was acknowledging the putative India\u2013China \u2018reset\u2019 in bilateral relations and the attendant need for cooperative engagement with the PLAN. Or maybe he was subtly cautioning his subordinates that they needed to do more to counter the China threat in India\u2019s strategic backyard.\n\nAbhijit Singh is Senior Fellow and Head of the Maritime Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi."

The annual must-pass bill covers military hardware, personnel and a wide swath of hot-button national security issues.\n\nIn a minor win for opponents of the new weapon, the energy secretary would not be able to reprogram money to begin a nuclear weapons program or begin a new phase of a nuclear weapons program.\n\nLow-yield nuclear weapons per 2004 law need special authorization from Congress, but the new legislation would make them equivalent to other nuclear weapons, with the same authorization requirements. That\u2019s a win for W76-2 advocates.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest move in a mostly partisan battle that saw the Senate Appropriations Committee approve a Pentagon spending bill with language to order more study before the weapon can be developed. The fate of the larger bill was unclear as of Tuesday.\n\nCongressional Republicans and the Pentagon are advocating for the systems to deter Russia from using its own arsenal of low-yield nuclear weapons. Still, many Democrats and nonproliferation advocates see it as lowering the threshold for a nuclear war.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nMore broadly, the compromise conference report includes a sense of Congress that expresses support for the administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review \u2014 and meets the president\u2019s budget with $142.2 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s nuclear weapons activities and defense nuclear nonproliferation program, according to a House Republican summary.\n\nThe bill would also increase authorized funding to accelerate two key Air Force nuclear modernization programs: the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and the Long Range Standoff cruise missile.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this story partially misstated the legislation\u2019s impact on congressional oversight of a low-yield nuclear weapon."

    "text": "The Nigerian Navy will soon receive two new FPB 110 patrol boats from France\u2019s Ocea, which has completed sea trials of the vessels and will load them onto a freighter for Nigeria.\n\nThe vessels are expected to depart Saint-Nazaire, France, later this month, according to Mer et Marine.\n\nIn February 2017 it emerged that Nigeria had ordered two FPB 110 Mk II coastal patrol vessels. They are 35 metres long and have a maximum speed of 30 knots. They will be fitted with two 12.7 mm machineguns and a 20 mm cannon and a 4.7 metre long Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The weapons will be added in Nigeria. Other equipment includes two Furuno radars and a Vigy Observer electro-optical system.\n\nNigeria\u2019s FPB 110s are based on the models produced for Kuwait, but are driven by propellers and not water jets. They are apparently also more comfortable for the crew, with improved accommodation. The two vessels, Nguru and Ekulu, can accommodate 17 people, including a dozen crew members.\n\nThe boats are powered by two MTU 16V2000 diesel engines giving a top speed of 30 knots and a range of 900 miles with 3-5 day endurance.\n\nOnce delivered, they will be used to improve maritime security off Nigeria, with an emphasis on piracy and maritime crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcea has delivered a number of other vessels to Nigeria, including three 24 metre long FPB 72s in 2012 and a 32 metre FPB 98 Mk II in 2013. Five FPB 72s have been ordered, with two, the Gongola and Calabar, delivered to Nigeria in January this year after the Shiroro and Ose arrived in 2017. The final FPB 72 will be delivered along with the two FPB 110s."

Ted Aljibe, AFP\n\nMANILA - The United States handed over six surveillance drones to its ally the Philippines on Tuesday, as part of efforts to boost its ability to tackle a growing threat from Islamist militants and to respond to natural disasters.\n\nThe six Boeing Insitu ScanEagle drones, which have two cameras and can operate for up to 24 hours on a single run, were financed through a $13.7 million grant from Washington's foreign military assistance program.\n\nIt follows the transfer of two single-engine surveillance planes last year.\n\nThe Philippines plans to deploy the drones for surveillance against militants and pirates, and for surveying the aftermath of disasters like typhoons, mudslides and earthquakes.\n\n\"This acquisition of ScanEagle is one way to modernize the military to deter those who want to wage war against our country,\" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at a ceremony at a Manila air force base, attended by the U.S. ambassador.\n\n\"This collaboration is also an indication of the Philippines and the United States' goodwill, deep friendship and genuine commitment to peace.\"\n\nThe United States is the most important military partner of the Philippines, with a decades-old treaty alliance and numerous pacts that enable rotational deployment of U.S. troops and annual joint exercises.\n\nHowever, ties have been tested by President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility towards the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military provided technical support and surveillance vital in helping the Philippines end a five-month occupation of Marawi City by pro-Islamic State rebels last year."

    "text": "Japan\u2019s government has approved a record defence budget, with money earmarked for costly missile defence systems and, controversially, weapons that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korea.\n\n\n\nThe 5.19tn yen ($46bn) budget, up 1.3% from last year, is the largest ever and marks the six straight annual rise in defence spending under Japan\u2019s conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe, who ended a decade of defence cuts soon after becoming prime minister in late 2012, has described the threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d.\n\nThe regime has launched two missiles over northern Japan this year, and several others have landed inside its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. In September, North Korea threatened to \u201csink Japan into the sea\u201d with a nuclear bomb after Tokyo and Washington spearheaded a new round of UN security council sanctions against the regime.\n\nDefence officials say Japan needs to drastically and quickly upgrade its missile defence in response to Pyongyang\u2019s rapid development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said this month: \u201cAt a time when North Korea is beefing up its ballistic missile capability, we need to strengthen our capability fundamentally.\u201d\n\nThe new budget, which has to be approved by parliament, came days after Japan said it would buy land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence systems from the US to improve its ability to locate and destroy incoming North Korean missiles.\n\nAbout 730m yen ($6.4m) was set aside to prepare for the introduction of the systems, which will be operational by 2023 and are expected to cost at least 200bn yen.\n\nAmid pressure from hawkish members of Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), Japan will also acquire cruise missiles that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korean military sites.\n\nThe budget includes more than 2bn yen for a Norwegian-built cruise missile with a range of 500km that can be fired from F-35 stealth fighter jets. Japan also plans to buy US-made cruise missiles with a range of 900km.\n\nIn addition to the land-based Aegis radar stations, Japan will invest in a new, longer-range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, and upgrades to Patriot missile batteries \u2013 the last line of defence against incoming warheads.\n\nThe heavy spending on US military hardware comes after Donald Trump vowed to boost arms sales by pressuring Japan and South Korea to play a bigger role in their own defence. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan,\u201d Trump said during a visit to Asia last month.\n\nCritics say possession of a first-strike capability violates Japan\u2019s constitution, which bans the use of force to settle international disputes and has restricted the country\u2019s military to a purely defensive role since the end of the second world war.\n\nOnodera and other senior LDP officials say Japan would target North Korean missile sites only if it believed an attack was imminent \u2013 a move they insist would not violate the country\u2019s \u201cpacifist\u201d principles.\n\nBut Yukio Edano, whose Constitutional Democratic party of Japan fought October\u2019s general election vowing to defend Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, said the acquisition of cruise missiles would be a \u201cfairly big point of dispute\u201d when MPs debate the budget next month.\n\nAkira Kato, a professor of international politics and regional security at JF Oberlin University in Tokyo, said the Abe administration was exploiting the North Korean crisis to bolster Japan\u2019s defences. \u201cJapan is expected to continue strengthening its defence power for the time being,\u201d Kato told Agence France-Presse.\n\nWhile the budget\u2019s focus was on North Korea, it included more than 55bn yen for the construction of military facilities on two outlying islands to boost the ability to respond to Chinese activity in the East China Sea.\n\nThe islands are not far from the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands \u2013 uninhabited outcrops that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, whose vessels regularly enter Japanese waters near the territories."

Relevant country can do more things conducive to strengthening the mechanism of international arms control and safeguarding international and regional peace and stability.\"\n\nXinhua\n\nChina said on Tuesday it hopes that relevant country can do more things conducive to strengthening the mechanism of international arms control and safeguarding international and regional peace and stability.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the comments after US President Donald Trump announced on April 26 that the United States was withdrawing from the Arms Trade Treaty, which regulates international trade in conventional arms and seeks to prevent and eradicate illicit trade and diversion of conventional arms by establishing international standards governing arms transfers.\n\n\"We hope that relevant country can do more things conducive to strengthening the mechanism of international arms control and safeguarding international and regional peace and stability,\" Geng said at a daily press briefing.\n\nCalling ATT an important multilateral treaty in the field of conventional arms control, Geng said that China supports the international community taking necessary measures in setting standards for international trade of arms and cracking down on illegal transfer and trafficking of arms.\n\nChina supports the purpose and goals of the ATT, and has been attending relevant conferences as an observer, Geng said, adding China has been considering joining the treaty."

    "text": "Denel Dynamics has received another order for its Seeker 400 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) after completing deliveries to the South African National Defence Force. It has also received a small contract for Seeker 200 platforms from a Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe Middle Eastern contract, worth R182 million, was announced at the Dubai air show in November 2017, but it was not at the time specified which models had been ordered. According to Sello Ntsihlele, head of business development at Denel Dynamics, the order was for a small number of Seeker 200s to replenish an existing fleet.\n\nDenel Dynamics has received another order for its larger Seeker 400 UAV, from a customer who cannot yet be disclosed. Ntsihlele told defenceWeb the contract was \u201csubstantial\u201d.\n\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was the launch customer for the Seeker 400, and took delivery of its first aircraft in late 2015. Ntsihlele said Denel Dynamics was in the process of handing the system over to the SANDF and this would probably conclude by year-end. The company was awarded an interim military type certificate for the Seeker 400 system and additional efforts are underway towards a full military type certification.\n\nInternationally, Ntsihlele said there is huge interest in the Seeker 400, especially the armed version, which can be fitted with lightweight Impi and Impi-S missiles or the unpowered GPS-guided P2. The 14 kg P2 was delivered for a client in the Middle East and has been qualified on the Seeker 200.\n\nThe Seeker 400 is somewhat unusual in that it can carry two sensor payloads (weighing a combined 100 kg) at the same time, such as an optronic sensor turret like the Argos II and a synthetic aperture radar or electronic intelligence package. In this configuration it is known as the Enhanced Seeker 400 and will be shown in this configuration at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) exhibition at AFB Waterkloof from September 19 to 23. Up until now the Seeker 400 has been fitted with a single sensor payload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seeker 400 can be used for a wide range of military and civilian missions, including maritime surveillance and disaster reconnaissance. It has up to 16 hours endurance at altitudes up to 18 000 feet. At typical operating altitudes of between 4 500 and 9 000 feet, it is not visible from the ground by the human eye and is effectively inaudible. The UAV\u2019s line-of-sight range is 250 km from its ground station, but this can be doubled by using a forward ground station with deployed forces."

    "text": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At first glance from above it looks like any clean and neatly planned small town, complete with sports grounds, neat roads and large civic buildings.\n\nBut the town is on Subi reef in the Spratlys archipelago of the hotly contested South China Sea and, regional security experts believe, could soon be home to China\u2019s first troops based in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.\n\nPrivate sector data analysis reviewed by Reuters shows Subi, some 1,200 km (750 miles) from China\u2019s coast, is now home to nearly 400 individual buildings \u2013 far more than other Chinese islands.\n\nSubi could be the future location of hundreds of People\u2019s Liberation Army marines, as well as a possible administrative hub as China cements its claim with a civilian presence, security analysts and diplomatic sources say.\n\nThe data from Earthrise Media, a non-profit group supporting independent media with imagery research, was based on surveys of high-resolution images obtained by DigitalGlobe satellites, dating back to when China started dredging reefs in early 2014.\n\nThe images show neat rows of basketball courts, parade grounds and a wide variety of buildings, some flanked by radar equipment.\n\nEarthrise founder Dan Hammer said his team\u2019s count included only free-standing, permanent and recognizable structures.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at these pictures I see a standard PLA base on the mainland \u2013 it is incredible, right down to the basketball courts,\u201d Singapore-based security analyst Collin Koh said after reviewing the data and images.\n\n\u201cAny deployment of troops will be a huge step, however \u2013 and then they will need to secure and sustain them, so the military presence will have to only grow from where it is now.\u201d\n\nSenior Western diplomats describe the placement of troops or jet fighters on the islands as a looming test of international efforts to curb China\u2019s determination to dominate the vital trade waterway.\n\nSubi is the largest of China\u2019s seven man-made outposts in the Spratlys. The so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d of Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs all share similar infrastructure \u2013 including emplacements for missiles, 3km runways, extensive storage facilities and a range of installations that can track satellites, foreign military activity and communications.\n\nMischief and Fiery Cross each house almost 190 individual buildings and structures, according to the Earthrise analysis. The previously unpublished data details the building count on more than 60 South China Sea features, including those occupied by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines.\n\nWhile the data shows well developed infrastructure on some on islands such as Vietnam's Spratly Island, the Philippines' Thitu Island and Taiwan's Itu Aba, the scale and development by Beijing dwarfs its rivals. (For a multimedia package on the data, click tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne)\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nThe number of buildings on Subi makes it similar in size to Woody Island in the Paracels, a Beijing-controlled group much closer to China also claimed by Vietnam.\n\nWoody is the base and surveillance post which foreign military attaches say is the headquarters of the military division across the South China Sea, reporting to the PLA\u2019s southern theater command.\n\nKoh and other analysts said the facilities on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross could each hold a regiment - between 1,500 to 2,400 troops.\n\nChina\u2019s precise intentions remain unclear and Chinese experts say much will depend on whether Beijing feels threatened by regional security trends, particularly U.S. activity such as its so-called \u201cfreedom of navigation patrols\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s defense ministry did not respond to Reuters questions about the build-up on Subi or what the facilities could be used for.\n\nBeijing has consistently said the facilities on its reclaimed islands are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with their freedom of navigation patrols.\n\nDing Duo, a researcher at the Chinese government-backed National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Beijing needs a military presence in the Spratlys to protect its civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs for how big that presence is depends on the threat assessment China has going forward for the Nansha Islands,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the Spratlys.\n\n\u201cThe Nansha region faces severe military pressure, especially since Trump took office and increased freedom of navigation patrols. So China has raised its threat assessment.\u201d\n\nLOOMING TEST\n\nThe White House said this month it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization after CNBC reported anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems had been installed on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross. [nL1N1SA1VE]\n\nThis weekend, China revealed bombers had conducted take-off and landing training on some of its islands and reefs in preparation for what it called \u201cthe battle for the South China Sea\u201d. [nL3N1SR08Q]\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nSome U.S. analysts noted PLA photographs appeared to show a bomber landing on Woody Island in the Paracels, and the Chinese military has yet to confirm planes actually landed on its Spratlys holdings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to join a major naval drill because of Beijing\u2019s continued militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. [nL2N1SU1KU]\n\nAdmiral Philip Davidson, the nominee to be the next commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific, said last month the bases were now complete and lacked only deployed forces.\n\n\u201cAny forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\u201d Davidson told a congressional panel.\n\nSo far, repeated U.S. naval patrols close to Chinese features and growing international naval deployments through the region have had little obvious impact on Beijing\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cThere is a real sense among Western nations that a new strategy is needed, but there is little sign anything meaningful coalescing,\u201d said one senior Western diplomat familiar with discussions across several countries. \u201cThe deployment of jet fighters \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will sorely test that lack of a cohesive response.\u201d\n\nAlready large Chinese amphibious landing vessels and other ships have used the full-scale naval wharves at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief \u2013 pointing to what foreign naval officers describe as virtually a permanent presence throughout hotly contested waters.\n\nChinese forces are using their island holdings to police of what Chinese naval officers tell other navies is a \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d \u2013 an ambiguous term that both Asian and Western military officials say holds no basis in international law.\n\nPeople briefed on recent Western intelligence reports describe an intensifying pattern of radio challenges to foreign military ships and aircraft delivered from Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on Fiery Cross.\n\nAustralian officials recently publicized a \u201crobust but polite\u201d Chinese challenge to three of its naval ships plying the South China Sea en route to Vietnam.\n\nSources say such exchanges between Chinese and foreign militaries are far more frequent than is widely known.\n\n\u201cThey have become the rule rather than the exception across significant areas of the South China Sea,\u201d one person familiar with recent Western security reports told Reuters.\n\nShips and aircraft from India, France, Japan, New Zealand and rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have also been similarly warned, according to regional military officials and analysts.\n\nWith the claimed \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d having no basis in international law or military practice, foreign naval officials routinely stress they are in international waters and continue on their way.\n\nZhang Baohui, a Chinese security expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, said Beijing was likely to be cautious about any offensive moves, such as the stationing of combat aircraft.\n\n\u201cNow the islands are complete, I think we will see a degree of caution in Beijing\u2019s next moves,\u201d he said. \u201cSustaining that presence so far from the Chinese coast is a massive undertaking, and I think the deployment of troops and jet fighters would really cross a threshold for China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials insist they are leaving little to chance, warning the bases are already helping China project military power into areas once dominated by its neighbors.\n\n\u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d Davidson said in his testimony last month."

    "text": "BRUSSELS \u2015 The European Union has agreed to bolster the ailing European defense industry by allocating \u20ac500 million (U.S. $585.19 million) in 2019 and 2020 to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme.\n\nThe EDIDP is a new program aimed at the development, for instance, of drones for military use or a European cyber defense mechanism. Funding is expected to increase to \u20ac1 billion per year from 2021.\n\nIt means increased pan-EU cooperation in major weapons systems such as aircraft, battle tanks and navy ships should now be possible.\n\nBoom or bust? German industry sizes up Euro-defense potential A whitepaper aims to clean up major misunderstandings surrounding the nascent PESCO process, chiefly the assumption that the construct represents a pot of money for which companies can apply.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the \u201ccore objective\u201d of the funding was to make Europe\u2019s defense industry more competitive and innovative. The program will act as an \u201cenabler for cooperation, incentivising potential collaborative development programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt aims to encourage cooperation in developing the technologies and equipment needed to address common defense and security challenges,\u201d added the spokesman.\n\nWhat remains unclear at this stage, however, is the role and future involvement of the U.K. in EU-funded defense programs after it exits the EU, due to happen at the end of March 2019.\n\nQuestions remain particularly about the impact a British exit will have on the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and, indeed, on the desirable future agreements between the U.K. and the EU in this area.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith a turnover of \u20ac97.3 billion in 2014, 500,000 people directly employed and 1.2 million indirect jobs, the European defence industry is a major industrial sector. But the European defense market has been shrinking, with NATO saying spending on defense by its 26 European members slipped to about $250 billion in 2014 from $275 billion in 2010.\n\nThe new \u20ac500 million funding, announced Wednesday, is partly designed to the give the sector an economic shot in the arm.\n\nThe deal will now be presented to EU ambassadors for their endorsement on May 29, after which it will be submitted to the European Parliament for a vote and then to the EU member states for final adoption.\n\nIt is expected that the program will finance the first capability projects in 2019.\n\nTo foster the pan-EU development of defense systems, the requirement is that a minimum of three companies from three EU countries participate.\n\nFor prototypes, up to 20 percent of the cost could be covered by the program while for other actions such as design or testing, it can go up to 100 percent.\n\nFor the period 2021-2027 the EU also plans to allocate \u20ac13 billion for the European Defence Fund, a relatively new initiative which has already started to fund pan-European research projects.\n\nThe new funding announcement was welcomed by El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, EU commissioner for the internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises, who said the program \u201cis part of our wider efforts to establish a credible Defence Union which protects its citizens. With this agreement, we are building EU\u2019s strategic autonomy and boosting the competitiveness of the EU defense industry.\u201d\n\nFurther comment came from Krasimir Karakachanov, Deputy Prime Minister for Public Order and Security, Minister for Defence of Bulgaria, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, who added, \u201cThis agreement will allow the European Union to fund for the first time a programme on defence capabilities. This new step in our security and defence cooperation reflects the importance in today\u2019s world of doing more as Europeans for our own security.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, a senior French centre right Member of the European Parliament and rapporteur on the issue in Parliament, said, \u201cWe have taken a first and very important step to increase cooperation in the defence industry and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU defence industry.\n\n\u201cThe all-European defense technological and industrial base, in particular our SMEs and mid-caps, will benefit from this program in order to strengthen our strategic autonomy. Excellence and innovation will be the main drivers.\u201d\n\nA source at the European Defence Agency, based in Brussels, said, \u201cmaintenance of a strong and competitive DTIB in Europe is a fundamental underpinning of the European security and defense policy. A robust EDTIB is a prerequisite to the EDA achieving its mission: improving the EU\u2019s defense capabilities."

    "text": "The Minister of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan Yavar Jamalov held a press conference, on December 17, to discuss the outcomes of 2017 for the country\u2019s defense industry sector. The minister pointed out that this past year, two additional military-production factories were built in Azerbaijan. Thus, the total number of defense-manufacturing facilities in the country is now 58 (Trend, December 17, 2017). Moreover, these new factories were fully equipped with modern machinery developed by leading Western defense contractors. The Ministry of Defense Industry plans to launch two more new factories, which will be able to produce four kinds of modern artillery shells, mortars, and armor for military vehicles. Moreover, new military labs will be developed to produce blasting powder, trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexogen (RDX) chemical compounds (Azerbaijan-news.az, December 17, 2017).\n\nSince its establishment, the Ministry of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan has sought to eliminate the country\u2019s military dependence on foreign suppliers and to further develop its mass-production capabilities in the defense sector. Due to the unresolved conflict with its arch-rival Armenia over the Karabakh region, Azerbaijan has significantly raised military expenditures since the beginning of the 2000s (Tradingeconomics.com, accessed January 8). However, anemic energy-export revenues in recent years had forced the government to cut back its defense budget. So the current recovery in the global oil and natural gas price have allowed Baku to somewhat increase its annual military budget for 2018, in particular to boost the domestic defense industry.\n\nThe draft military budget for 2018, released by the Ministry of Finance on October 9, outlines plans to increase the defense budget to 2.73 billion manat ($1.6 billion), representing a 3.7 percent increase over 2017\u2019s allocation of 2.64 billion manat ($1.56 billion). The 2018 allocation includes 1.36 billion manat ($800 million) in funding for the Armed Forces, 0.1 billion ($60 million) for national security and 1.258 billion ($740 million) in other defense expenditures (Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly, October 24, 2017).\n\nAzerbaijan considers the financial boost to the defense industry especially vital, particularly in the aftermath of the tense situation along the Line of Contact (LoC) in the Karabakh region, following the four-day war in April of 2016 (see EDM, April 6, 2016; May 5, 2016; May 11, 2016). Azerbaijan\u2019s active usage of domestically produced weaponry during the April conflict further prompted Baku to increase local production and more heavily rely on it. Thus, Yavar Jamalov confirmed that Azerbaijan has launched preliminary tests of domestic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) capable of striking human targets and enemy\u2019s military equipment. The Ministry is currently concentrating its efforts on developing the Zarba-1K, a local derivative of the Israeli-produced Aeronautics Orbiter 1K. \u201cMoreover, negotiations on the creation of electropulse [sic] weapons are being conducted with a number of countries,\u201d he said (CBC, December 18, 2017). The production of various unmanned drones, armor for vehicles, machine guns, and sniper rifles is mostly being carried out by Azerbaijan\u2019s \u201cAlov,\u201d \u201cAgregat\u201d and \u201cAZAD\u201d military factories.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense Industry is readying to complete and present 17 new, next-generation domestically produced weapons, some of which will be developed jointly with the Azerbaijani National Aerospace Agency. The priority in 2018 will be given to the production of the new \u201cTufan\u201d (Storm) armored military vehicle\u2014the first fully domestically produced vehicle, featuring a stabilized remote-controlled weapons system (RWS), and equipped with a 12.7-millimeter NVS machine gun, a 40-millimeter QP-25 grenade-launcher, a 107-millimeter Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and a domestically produced long-range missile system (Milli.az, December 17, 2017). Mass production of the Tufan will start in 2018. The vehicle will come in four varieties: medical evacuation, air-defense/ anti-armor, anti-riot and a basic armored personnel carrier (APC). Azerbaijan is also developing a version that will be available for export.\n\nAs the military budget gradually grows this year, the national defense industry is expected to undergo further expansion in 2018, which means that the country\u2019s military exports will likely also grow. According to Defense Industry Minister Jamalov, Azerbaijan currently exports weapons to more than ten foreign countries. In 2016, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense Industry increased the volume of defense-industry production by 1.6 times, compared to 2015, while the product assortment rose by 1.8 times (Qafqazinfo.az, December 17, 2017). In this regard, Azerbaijan strives to increase military exports, while decreasing imports of weaponry from other countries. While much of Azerbaijan\u2019s military production must be attributed to joint ventures\u2014especially with Israeli (see EDM, September 25, 2017), Turkish (see EDM, October 26, 2017) and South-African companies\u201431 domestic production sites currently produce entirely homegrown technology (Trend, July 11, 2017).\n\nIn light of ongoing violence and tensions with Armenia over Karabakh, and repeated failure to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Azerbaijan is prioritizing efforts to boost its defense industry in 2018. And as its domestic military manufacturers continue to be ever more innovative and self-sufficient, Baku will seek to carve out an increasingly larger share of the global arms market."

    "text": "ROME \u2014 The U.S. government\u2019s nuclear warhead agency is scheduled to receive $15.1 billion in the Trump administration\u2019s fiscal 2019 budget request, a 17.5 percent increase over the previous year\u2019s request as the administration seeks to refresh and improve America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous arm of the Department of Energy, has oversight on nuclear warhead development, production and security. This is the second year the NNSA was slated for a budget increase, although the FY18 request \u2014 $13.9 billion, an increase of 7.8 percent over the FY17 omnibus level \u2014 has yet to be enacted.\n\nThe Nuclear Posture Review, released Feb. 2, called for the development of two new nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as heavy investment in infrastructure to support the nuclear arsenal. But just how NNSA would do in the new budget, which has sometimes struggled with funding in comparison to the broader defense budget, was unclear.\n\nOf the NNSA\u2019s budget, just more than $11 billion are dedicated to weapons activity. The agency is currently doing a massive refresh on its warhead programs, which involves refurbishing and redesigning five warhead variants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government Accountability Office has warned that NNSA is underfunded for its needs.\n\nThe funding will be welcomed by proponents of the NNSA, particularly after comments from the previous administrator, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank Klotz, that his agency was \u201cat capacity.\u201d\n\nNotably, the NNSA could be in line for another plus-up in the FY20 budget. Speaking during the NPR rollout, Steve Erhart, acting undersecretary for nuclear security and NNSA administrator, said to expect \u201cmore fidelity in the budget request in the following year, FY20.\u201d"

Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen/via REUTERS\n\nU.S. export control laws can be used to limit European weapons sales if even small components come from U.S. suppliers. That legislation was in place prior to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but the industry has grown increasingly worried that his administration is acting to halt exports that might have been permitted in the past.\n\nWashington has this year blocked the sale to Egypt of French-made SCALP cruise missiles, which contain a U.S. part.\n\nWithout giving specific examples, Defence Minister Florence Parly said France needed to \u201cgradually wean ourselves off our reliance on a certain number of American parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had trade difficulties linked to the prospects for exports. And we know that these difficulties are linked to strategic questions and often to problems of commercial rivalry,\u201d she told a small group of journalists.\n\nShe was quizzed on the subject in July by parliament\u2019s defense committee.\n\nAsked at that time by one lawmaker about the blocked SCALP sale, Parly said: \u201cWe are at the mercy of the Americans.\u201d\n\nParly said Washington\u2019s actions underlined the need to minimize dependence on U.S. parts in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) project - Europe\u2019s next-generation combat jet which France and Germany are taking the lead in developing.\n\nFrance\u2019s Dassault Aviation and European planemaker Airbus have signed a deal to work together on the jet, which is expected to be at the center of a broader weapons system capable of commanding a squadron of drones.\n\nFrance\u2019s air force uses Reaper drones, built by U.S. firm General Atomics, in its counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militants. Parly said France had needed U.S. congressional approval to arm the drones.\n\n\u201cIs that satisfactory? No. But we don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she said."

    "text": "WASHINGTON: The Polish government is working to renegotiate an arms deal approved by the State Department last year for the U.S.-made HIMARS long-range rocket artillery system after experiencing some sticker shock when seeing the final price tag.\n\nThe $250 million package for the rocket launcher along with guided warheads and other tactical missiles was seen as a way for Poland and NATO to push back against the Russian military buildup in neighboring Kaliningrad, which gives Moscow the ability to track and knock down Polish aircraft over Polish airspace. The HIMARS, Polish officials told me, would give them the ability to hit targets at a longer range if their aircraft were unable to fly.\n\nBut almost six months on, the deal remains a work in progress even as the Trump administration has kicked off a new initiative to eliminate red tape, speed up timelines, and cut costs for sales of U.S. military equipment to allies overseas.\n\nMaj. Gen. Cezary Wi\u015bniewski \u2014 a former F-16 pilot now serving as Poland\u2019s Defense Attache to the United States \u2014 told me during a recent conversation at the Polish consulate here, his government very much wants to move forward with the HIMARS deal, but can\u2019t at the current price. The Polish government and HIMARS-maker Lockheed Martin continue to hash out possibilities for making the deal happen, but neither side would, for the moment, give much insight on how to bring costs down.\n\nWi\u015bniewski said that the mobile rocket artillery system remains a priority due to the continued Russian buildup in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea that allows Russian radars and S-400 missile systems to reach deep inside Polish territory, essentially taking away any home field advantage Polish pilots might have in the event of a conflict.\n\nCrucially, the deal also supports a Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) between Lockheed and PGZ, Poland\u2019s state-run defense group, which is the prime contractor in Poland.\n\nA spokesperson for Lockheed told me that the company \u201cis fully committed\u201d to working the deal, and \u201chas remained engaged and flexible with PGZ, ready to finalize a [missile defense] offering that will provide commonality and interoperability with U.S. forces and NATO partners.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Warsaw wants out of the deal are offsets, which would allow PGZ to build components in Poland.\n\nJust last month, as part of inking the largest arms deal in Polish history \u2014 a $4.75 billion contract for Patriot air defense systems and other associated equipment \u2014 Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman agreed to offsets worth about $280 million.\n\nNegotiations over Phase II of that Patriot program began on April 16, and include talks about buying a 360 degree radar, and additional offsets.\n\n\u201cWe would like to procure the same 360 degree radar that is under development by the U.S. Army,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said. \u201cIt has not been selected by the Army, yet so we are waiting. We would like to use the same system so the integration and sustainment costs would be lower.\u201d\n\nBut the Polish government is also looking to shift more work to its own defense industry. \u201cWe expect the Phase II would provide us more technology transfer than Phase I,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for more technology transfer for our industry.\u201d\n\nOne key element of the current negotiations is Raytheon\u2019s low-cost SkyCeptor interceptor missile, which would be used in a nascent short-range interceptor program called Narew, which Warsaw wants to build locally, according to Wi\u015bniewski.\n\nThe general described a gap in the budding Polish air defense ecosystem between shoulder-fired MANPADS and the Patriot, a gap that will be filled by Narew, which his government considers crucial in bulking up its borders with Kaliningrad and providing the NATO alliance with more ground punch.\n\n\u201cIt helps us to deter,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysis haven\u2019t been surprised by the Polish interest in more air defenses, and its willingness to spend a lot of money to acquire the. \u201cI think this is a natural case of Poland looking to balance Russian military modernization and leverage their sizable defense budget to adjust for a new generation of capabilities deployed in Kaliningrad,\u201d said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA. \u201cOf course there is also the political aspect to defense procurement, seeking to leverage defense spending as another instrument to further build ties with the United States,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe original HIMARS announcement in November was part of a wave of big buys \u2014 including September\u2019s $1.25 billion agreement to sell the HIMARS and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Romania, who also agreed on a deal for seven Patriot Configuration 3 units in November \u2014 that signaled to Moscow that the alliance was was meeting Russian buildups in Kaliningrad and Crimea.\n\nAny HIMARS deal with Poland would be significant for NATO, as other than Romania, the only foreign buyers have been Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, while Qatar has received authorization to buy the system.\n\nThe government in Bucharest announced during in the summer of 2017 that it planned to buy HIMARS, along with 36 F-16 fighter jets by 2022, part of a long-term pan to lay out $11.6 billion on military procurements between 2017 through 202"

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The budget unveiled Monday by the Trump administration will see a drastic 70 percent\u201369.6 percent\u2013cut in aid to Armenia over the fiscal year 2017 budget, which allocated $22.4 million in assistance to Armenia. Trump\u2019s budget is calling for a $6.8 million aid package to Armenia.\n\n\u201cWe are troubled by President Trump\u2019s ill-advised and misguided proposal to sharply cut aid to Armenia. His budget recommendation underscores the need to work with Congressional appropriators to reverse these reductions, while redoubling our efforts to empower Armenia\u2019s aid-to-trade transition,\u201d said Aram Hamparian, Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of America.\n\n\u201cBuilding on 2015\u2019s Trade and Investment Framework Agreement and leveraging the five hundred million dollars in new U.S. investments in Armenia, we need to put in place a badly-needed Double Tax Treaty, launch direct Los Angeles to Yerevan flights, secure an MCC Science and Technology education grant for Armenian schools, and undertake other targeted commercial initiatives to strengthen the U.S.-Armenia bilateral economic relationship,\u201d added Hamparian.\n\nUnder the Administration\u2019s budget, aid to Armenia would be reduced by 70 percent, dropping from $22.4 million in FY17 to $6.8 million proposed for FY18. The Trump budget also reduces assistance to Azerbaijan by 90 percent as compared with FY16 to $1 million.\n\nThe Trump budget request for Armenia envisions $4 million in Economic Support and Development Fund, $1.5 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and $700,000 for Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Programs. Military parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan is maintained in the proposed budget with each receiving $600,000 for International Military Education and Training and cuts Foreign Military Financing to both countries. In the FY17 budget $1 million was allocated for FMF.\n\nIn early April, the Congressional Armenian Caucus called on key U.S. House appropriators to prioritize Fiscal Year 2018 foreign aid policies \u201cstrengthening Armenia\u2019s independence, promoting peace in Nagorno Karabakh, and supporting Armenia as a regional safe haven for at-risk Middle East refugees.\n\nAmong the specific priorities advanced by the Caucus were:\n\n\u2014 U.S. support for Armenia as a regional safe haven for Middle East refugees, in the form of a $40 million appropriation to support transitional programs, including short-term housing/rental assistance and social and economic integration initiatives.\n\n\u2014 A renewed focus on aid to Artsakh, with an appropriation of at least $8 million for de-mining, rehabilitation programs (such as the Lady Cox Rehabilitation Center), and water supply systems.\n\n\u2014 A focused effort to check Azerbaijani aggression, through the appropriation of at least $20 million to support implementation of the Royce-Engel peace proposals, the suspension of U.S. military aid to Baku, and the strengthening of Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.\n\n\u2014 An appropriation of at least $40 million in economic aid to Armenia, and no less than $11 million in military aid, with a focus on advancing U.S.-Armenia defense cooperation goals, promoting NATO interoperability, and supporting increased Armenia\u2019s participation in global peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn March, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Congressional Armenian Caucus Co-Chair Frank Pallone (D-NJ) delivered powerful testimony before key House foreign aid appropriators, calling for the expansion of U.S. assistance to Artsakh and Armenia, and the implementation of measures to check escalating Azerbaijani aggression.\n\nANCA\u2019s Hamparian also noted that the organization will continue working with congressional leaders to ensure that a portion of the Trump\u2019s proposed $2.75 billion allocated to Migration and Refugee Assistance would go to Armenia, which has accepted a large number of refugees from Syria over the course of the past several years."

Government sources who favor the deal are stressing the argument that Germany's friendship with Israel should guide the decision-making process, and this consideration carries weight in the Bundestag.\n\nUnder the program, the UAVs will be stationed in Israel under the management of the military wing of Airbus, at least in the first stage. The UAVs are initially designated for intelligence missions, such as aerial photography and surveillance of enemy forces. At a later stage, they are also likely to be used to attack ground targets, including targeted killings.\n\nThe UAVs are due to become available to the German army starting at the end of 2019."

    "text": "Following our detailed analysis of the H225/AS332L2 fleet movements yesterday there is one other key contract for H225s which we can now provide more details to.\n\nIn late May, the French Government announced that Airbus signed a \u20ac555 million ($643M) deal with Ukraine for 55 helicopters. The Ukraine Government have said that this covers 24 H125s, 10 H145s and 21 H225s [all other aviation press reports have wrongly claimed the split between H125 and H145s had not been revealed]. Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov has detailed that the 21 H225s are split further into 3 SAR models and 18 for transport roles.\n\nTo fund the purchase of these 55 helicopters, Ukraine will be borrowing all \u20ac555 million at 4.25% per annum from the State Treasury of France and a consortium of French banks. The deal includes setting up a maintenance base in Ukraine and training of both pilots and engineers.\n\nHowever, it is that figure of 21 H225s which raises our interest further.\n\nFurther investigation has found that some/most/all 21 H225s for Ukraine are ex-offshore H225s currently owned by leasing companies. Once source narrows that down to the 21 being \u201cowned by French banks\u201d and it is unlikely to be a coincidence that Parilease \u2013 the leasing arm of French bank BNP Paribas \u2013 has a fleet of precisely 21 H225s parked up, and three of these were in SAR specification for North Sea work off Norway. All 21 are currently on the Isle of Man aircraft register and are reportedly stored in France. The fleet were hand-backs or repossessions from the Chapter 11 process of operator CHC.\n\nIn October 2016, the helicopter trading company Avinco announced that they had struck a deal \u201cto recover, manage and remarket a fleet of EC225s previously operated by CHC following the operator\u2019s filing for Chapter 11\u201d, and that the fleet consisted of 18 in offshore configuration and 3 with SAR equipment. HeliHub.com revealed that the leasing company could only be Parilease.\n\nWhile we agree that there is some conjecture here and no 100% proof yet, it seems beyond the chance of possibility that the Ukraine H225 fleet purchases are all ex CHC offshore repossessions or hand-backs.\n\nJeremy Parkin \u2013 HeliHub.com\n\nRelated Posts"

That is slightly later than the three months of tests the Air Force had previously planned for the first C-130J.\n\nThe service can now fly the first two C-130Js to carry freight and passengers to foreign theaters. The first C-130J flew May 21 to support the French air base in Jordan.\n\nFrance welcomes the first C-130J Super Hercules airlifter Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly on Monday underscored a political close tie between France and the U.S. as she welcomed the first Super Hercules airlifter to join the French Air Force transport fleet.\n\nThe first C-130J was received Dec. 22 and was formally welcomed by Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly in January in a high-profile ceremony.\n\nAn additional two C-130Js are due for delivery next year, bringing to the French forces a long sought-after capability for aerial refueling of helicopters."

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 The German government has presented an ambitious plan for beefing up the country\u2019s armed forces over the next 10-plus years.\n\nThe strategy comes in the form of a new \u201ccapability profile,\u201d described by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as a \u201cgrand, comprehensive modernization concept.\u201d At its intermediate point, by 2024, it proposes Germany\u2019s annual defense budget at 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, or about \u20ac60 billion (U.S. $69 billion).\n\nThat would amount to a sizable increase for a country currently hovering around a GDP of \u20ac40 billion. But it would still fall short of the NATO-wide objective of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense.\n\nIn von der Leyen\u2019s telling, the new strategy would lift the armed forces from years of budget cutbacks and deprivation toward a set of capabilities deep enough to defend the homeland and simultaneously partake in out-of-area missions.\n\nIn the telling of critics, the strategy amounts to little more than wishful thinking because it assumes defense spending way above what is currently on the table.\n\nThe Social Democrats, which hold the reigns of the Finance Ministry in the current coalition government, previously rejected the type of stark budget boosts that the Defence Ministry believes is needed to plug longstanding shortfalls.\n\nGerman defense budget angers critics \u2014 including the defense minister Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Cabinet has approved a draft federal budget considered so insufficient for the armed forces by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that she submitted a formal note of protest along with her vote.\n\nAccording to a summary of the classified document released by the Defence Ministry, there are two priorities in the envisioned spending spree: soldier equipment and bringing the Bundeswehr up to speed in cyber capabilities.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nGermany\u2019s role in 2023 as a framework nation for the NATO Very High Readiness Joint Task Force will mark the first milestone in the government\u2019s plan, which goes out to 2031. Berlin is expected to provide a modernized \u201cbrigade-equivalent\u201d force package including air and naval components.\n\nIn accordance with another strategy document released last month, an updated concept of operations for the Bundeswehr, the new capability framework is built around the idea that there will be parity between the fundamental missions of defending Germany's territory and conducting overseas missions.\n\nWhile seeming trivial at first, that proclamation will have far-reaching, practical consequences on spending. Over the past years, defense leaders have routinely accepted shortfalls in home-station training to ensure troops in combat zones have the best possible equipment. Formally elevating the importance of homeland defense in the armed forces' planning means pumping new money into an area that officials say has been chronically underfunded.\n\nThe coming months will show how lawmakers, and especially those of the Social Democratic Party, will react to the proposal. Fritz Felgentreu, one of the party\u2019s leading voices on defense matters, told the Tagesschau website that the new strategy reads like a \u201cwell-thought-out wish list.\u201d He said he wants to see a \u201cconcrete analysis\u201d of exactly where additional money is needed."

    "text": "Zambia appears to be the previously undisclosed customer for two Alenia C-27J Spartan transport aircraft that were ordered in 2015. It is also expecting other aircraft this year.\n\nAccording to the Lusaka Times, Deputy Commander of the Zambia Air Force David Muma said the two C-27Js will be delivered in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nHe was speaking on 15 December at an annual ball at Livingstone Air Base. He said other acquisitions were on the way and thanked the government for modernising the Zambia Air Force through the acquisition of aircraft, air defence equipment and construction of support infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe recently received 450 unmanned aerial vehicles or drones which are currently based at ZAF Mumbwa air force base. The acquisition of the drones will enhance our surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and in the first quarter of 2018, two Spartan aircraft will be delivered and this will increase the flying capacity of air transport support command,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said ZAF was in the process of establishing a school of excellence which was to include the delivery of 15 aircraft for training purposes.\n\nIn September 2015 Finmeccanica-Alenia Aermacchi announced that an undisclosed African air force had ordered two C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, to become the third African customer after Chad and Morocco. The two aircraft were originally scheduled to be delivered from 2017.\n\nThe Spartan was developed from the G.222/C-27A, using the engines and systems of the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules to provide 30% lower operating costs than the G.222 and 35% greater range. It first flew on September 24, 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Spartan offers the ability to carry up to 60 troops in high density configuration and a maximum of 46 paratroopers. In the medical role 36 stretchers and six attendants can be carried. Normal payload is 9 000 kg for the C-27J, although maximum payload is more than 10 tons."

Transport aircraft include several SA330L Pumas, several Alouette IIIs, three SA 365 Dauphin helicopters and a single An-12 transport.\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Ivory Coast has only received a few items of military equipment since 2011, including a Predator patrol craft from China, three RPB 33 patrol boats from France and four AT-105 Saxon armoured patrol vehicles for use in United Nations operations in Mali.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the Ivory Coast\u2019s air force was largely destroyed by French troops in November 2004, following a deadly attack on French soldiers. Apparently seven aircraft were destroyed, leaving only eight military aircraft in operation. Further conflict and the second civil war in 2011 took their toll on the air arm, with few operational aircraft in the country\u2019s inventory."

    "text": "The Air Force just massed an amazing array of fire power. It just might have been in the wrong place.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2018, two U.S. Air Force wings in Utah launched thirty-five F-35 stealth fighters in a short span of time.\n\nThe air force lauded the display as evidence of America's overwhelming military might. At least one critic dismissed it as a publicity stunt.\n\nIn fact, there's one region where mass-takeoffs are an important military procedure: the Korean Peninsula. Ironically, that's the one region where the Trump administration is deliberately limiting the flying branch's authority to organize large-scale warplane-launches.\n\nThe November group-takeoff, which the air force calls an \"elephant walk,\" involved F-35As from the 388th and 419th Fighter Wings at Hill Air Force Base. The active-duty 388th and reserve 419th train air force F-35 pilots.\n\nThe 388th's 34th Fighter Squadron, whose F-35s have the latest Block 3F software, also has a front-line role. In late 2017, it became the first air force F-35 unit to deploy overseas, to Japan.\n\nAt the time of the elephant walk\u2014the first for the F-35\u2014the Utah wings possessed around forty F-35s. The wings are on track to receive a combined seventy-two F-35s by 2019.\n\nThe Hill stealth fighters took off one at a time in roughly 30-second intervals. In just a few minutes, the wings launched as many F-35 sorties as they normally do in a full day of routine training.\n\n\"Exercising with multiple squadrons of F-35s can demonstrate our ability to defeat potential adversaries wherever they may arise,\" Maj. Caleb Guthmann, the 34th Fighter Squadron's assistant director of operations, said in a statement.\n\nBut Valerie Insinna, a reporter for Defense News, echoed a more cynical sentiment when, on Twitter, she described the elephant walk as \"cool\" but \"very choreographed.\"\n\n\u201cCall me when they fix all the ALIS problems and then we'll talk,\u201d Insinna added, referring to the F-35's buggy Autonomic Logistics Information System, a computer network for the type's maintainers.\n\nIn a March 2018 congressional hearing, Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the air force's deputy chief of staff for plans, programs and requirements, said it cost around $50,000 to fly one F-35 for an hour. That's roughly twice what an F-16 costs for an hour in the air.\n\nIn fact, elephant walks significantly contribute to the readiness of American and allied squadrons in South Korea and nearby countries.\n\nIn the event of war with North Korea, U.S. and allied forces plan to quickly target the roughly 13,000 artillery pieces that Pyongyang has massed along the Korean demilitarized zone. In the early hours of a war, that artillery likely would bombard Seoul, which lies just 25 miles south of the DMZ.\n\n\"A serious, credible threat to 25 million [Republic of Korea] citizens and approximately 150,000 U.S. citizens living in the [Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area] is also posed from its long-range artillery,\" U.S. Army general Vincent Brooks, head of U.S. Forces Korea, told a U.S. Senate committee in March 2018.\n\nThe air force maintains three F-16 squadrons and an A-10 squadron in South Korea and two F-15 squadrons in Japan. Additional squadrons, almost certainly including F-35 units, would join them during a crisis. An air campaign targeting North Korea would require 2,000 sorties per day, U.S. military officials told Air Force magazine.\n\nBy comparison, the allied air war over Iraq and Kuwait in January 1991 averaged 1,200 strike sorties per day, according to statistics compiled by David Deptula, a former air force general who is now an analyst for the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Virginia. The U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria averaged just fifteen strikes per day, according to Deptula.\n\nThe roughly 100 U.S. F-16s and A-10s in South Korea and Japan\u2014and any F-35s that deployed in time for the first day of fighting\u2014likely would be the first to hit North Korean artillery. And they'd have to launch fast to save lives in Seoul.\n\nThere is a reason that the 7th Air Force in South Korea and Japan has organized more elephant walks than most air force commands have done. \"The threat here on the peninsula is very real, and countering that threat needs to be in the forefront of our minds,\" Col. William D. Betts, then-commander of the 51st Fighter Wing in South Korea, said in 2017.\n\nBut the Korea elephant walk is an endangered species. The 7th Air Force has conducted most of its mass-takeoffs, which require intensive planning and maintenance efforts, under the auspices of the annual Vigilante Ace exercise.\n\nIn 2018 the Trump administration suspended Vigilant Ace as a concession to North Korea, hoping that Pyongyang in turn would suspend its nuclear-weapons program. North Korea has continued to develop its nukes.\n\nThe air force organized elephant walks in South Korea in 2016 and 2017 but not in 2018. The suspension of large-scale exercises with South Korea hasn\u2019t created \"immediate\" concerns about combat-readiness, Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. Charles Brown said in November 2018. But it could cause \"difficulties\" if it continues.\n\nThere's nothing preventing air force squadrons that aren't in South Korea, including Hill's F-35 units, from practicing mass takeoffs. These same squadrons might deploy to the Korean Peninsula during wartime, in which case their elephant walks would amount to more than an expensive public relations exercise.\n\nThey'd be preparation for the kind of sudden, overwhelming violence a new Korean war would require.\n\nDavid Axe edits War Is Boring.

    "text": "Botswana purchased \u20ac304.2 million worth of military hardware from France in 2016, including MICA-VL and Mistral missiles.\n\nThis is according to the French Ministry for the Armed Forces 2017 report to Parliament on arms exports, published in July. Most of the money is believed to be from a contract with European missile manufacturer MBDA for MICA-VL and Mistral missiles. It has been reported that Botswana has been interested in these missiles for a time, and Botswana Defence Force (BDF) commander Lt Gen Galebotswe accompanied by Lt Col Mokgadi and Lt Col Motlaleng were in France in December 2015 for a demonstration of the missile systems.\n\nThe MICA-VL is a short range, ground based air defence system deploying the MICA fire-and-forget missile, capable of being fitted with either a heat-seeking homing head or with an active radar seeker head. Interception range is up to 20 km.\n\nThe Mistral man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) is a short range weapon using a fire-and-forget heat-seeking missile with a range of up to 6 km. It is normally operated by a gunner and a crew commander. However, if the mission is carried out in a simple tactical environment, it can be operated by one single soldier. Mistral entered series production in 1989 and over 16 000 missiles have been ordered by more than 27 countries.\n\nAs noted by ADIT \u2013 The Bulletin, the Mistral/MICA agreement is not the first defence deal between Botswana and France, as the BDF is a user of ACMAT (Ateliers de Construction M\u00e9canique de L\u2019Atlantique) vehicles. However, last year\u2019s contracts dwarf orders in previous years of \u20ac12 million in 2014 and just \u20ac0.1 million in 2015.\n\nAccording to the report, France delivered 14 missile launchers to Botswana in 2016. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Arms Transfer Database notes that Botswana bought 100 Strela-3/SA-14 surface-to-air missiles from the Ukraine in 2012.\n\nGaborone is believed to be negotiating with Sweden for between eight and 12 Gripen fighter jets to replace its CF-5 fighters, for an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. Other procurements include a $179 million deal for 45 Piranha 3 armoured vehicles from Swiss company GDELS-Mowag.\n\nBotswana is an important market for France. Paris granted 15 defence export licences in 2016, as compared to five the year before. The law enforcement sector is also an important market \u2013 Airbus Helicopters sold three AS350 B3e (now known as the H125) Ecureuil helicopters to the Police Air Support Branch in January 2015, which joined three already acquired in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in July this year it emerged that Botswana has purchased 500 second hand Land Rover 110 Defenders for P161 million (12.5 million pounds) from UK-based Witham Specialist Vehicles. Land Rover Jaguar ended the production of the Defender range and its spare parts in 2015. The BDF and the Botswana Police Services Special Support Group (SSG) still have large fleets of the Defender 110 which are used for troop transportation and operational support roles."

    "text": "According to romania-Insider website, US defense group Raytheon will deliver its latest Configuration 3+ of the Patriot air defense missile system to Romania, the one currently used by the US Army, according to Mike Ellison, country manager of Raytheon Romania, local News.ro reported.\n\n\n\nM901 launcher unit of Patriot air defense missile system at Paris Air Show in June 2009\n\nThe systems have new hardware and software components, added in 2017. The most modern/current variant of Patriot is called Patriot Configuration 3+, not PAC-3. PAC-3 is one of the missiles used by Configuration 3+, but as Patriot is an entire system, not just a missile, the Config 3+ enhancements involve a whole suite of upgrades and capabilities. One of them is enabling the system to take advantage of the PAC-3 MSE capabilities, but there are many other things, such as a better user interface and increased reliability, that Config 3+ has.\n\nMike Ellison, country manager of Raytheon Romania, said that Romanian specialists will contribute in the future to optimizing and modernizing this system. Some components of the Patriot systems, namely parts of the radar, may be produced in Romania, by local company Aerostar Bacau, Raytheon announced earlier this year. According to Ellison, the partnership between Romania and Raytheon has an important role in strengthening NATO\u2019s Eastern flank as Europe faces the biggest challenges since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Romania has already paid the first Patriot system, which has a cost of USD 910.1 million. The total cost of this program is USD 4.64 billion, VAT included.\n\nThe MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high performance radar systems. The Patriot system is modular and highly mobile. A battery-sized element can be emplaced in less than 1 hour. The latest version is the PAC-3. Due to miniaturization, a single canister can hold four PAC-3 missiles (as opposed to one PAC-2 missile per canister). The PAC-3 missile is also more maneuverable than previous variants, due to 180 tiny pulse solid propellant rocket motors mounted in the forebody of the missile (called Attitude Control Motors, or ACMs) which serve to fine align the missile trajectory with its target to achieve hit-to-kill capability. The PAC-3 can hit ballistic missile up to 20km."

    "text": "Covering politicians who constantly say stupid things while hoping that they will say a sensible thing in the future is a symptom of journalism in the age of extreme populism.\n\nInstead of treating every madcap utterance with surprise, it is time to make peace with the fact that, when speaking of science, Union \u2018science\u2019 minister Harsh Vardhan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi simply lack the competence to speak knowledgeably. They are not going to say sensible stuff in the future. It is time to stop covering each proclamation that \u201cthe Vedas said it all\u201d with a clarification that they did not. Everyone who has ever been willing to be persuaded otherwise has already been persuaded otherwise; the facts, as they say, are right there.\n\nJournalism has reason to value objectivity above all else but objectivity is not \u2018balance\u2019 in some mechanical sense; it is the capacity to evaluate a bit of information such that the evaluator can eliminate cognitive and intellectual biases from the evaluation. Not surprisingly, those who would end up on the wrong end of a truly objective evaluation are the ones who demand \u2018evenhandedness\u2019 and scream the loudest about bias when a report is not empathetic. Hence the popular perception that if a story quotes someone saying A is wrong, it must also include the voices of those who think A is right.\n\nYet even this demand for false balance goes out the window the moment a minister comes along to publicly proclaim that people flew airplanes 3,000 years ago and grafted elephant heads onto human bodies. There is no point in collecting quotations from those who believe the minister is right when objective methods of evaluation have established that the minister is wrong. This is not journalism\u2019s loss of objectivity because misconstrued objectivity was never journalism\u2019s purpose.\n\nIndeed, pretensions of objectivity would be downright unethical while reporting on a science minister\u2019s pseudoscientific claims on a stage meant for scientists, and the audience\u2019s quiet tolerance of his words.\n\nAny other country with aspirations akin to India\u2019s on the science front might have shunned a man as unhinged in his opinions of science as Harsh Vardhan, but he is protected in India by a culture that exalts, and sometimes makes excuses for, political and bureaucratic patronage. In a political culture fixated on hero worship, journalism should question his right \u2013 and those who afford him that right \u2013 to insult our intelligence and debase the endeavours of highly qualified men and women his ministry is responsible for supporting.\n\nThe man seems unstoppable \u2013 and it no longer seems fair for us to expect him to stop. At the 105th Indian Science Congress that kicked off in Imphal on Friday, Harsh Vardhan went on stage to say that Stephen Hawking had acknowledged that the Vedas might have \u201coffered a better theory\u201d than the mass-energy equivalence in Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity (the latter probably better known as the equation E = mc2).\n\nWhat Vardhan has said has no meaning. The Vedas could have offered a better theory for what exactly? E = mc2 is not a theory \u2013 it is a \u2018problem\u2019 that requires solving in contexts where the relationship between the variables as specified in the equation applies. More generally, E = mc2 is not the kind of solution Vardhan is hoping it could have been because it wasn\u2019t exclusively developed to resolve a germane problem. On the contrary, it was developed first, based on which humans invented challenges that the equation could help surmount.\n\nIt is also funny that Vardhan\u2019s celebration of the Vedas as an instrument with which to claim historic primacy and superiority directly contradicts the manner in which the minister sought to use a scientist from the very West that he and his parivar deride as a crutch for his nonsensical claim.\n\nFinally, Hawking himself has never acknowledged that \u201cthe Vedas are better\u201d (Update, March 18: a member of the Stephen Hawking Foundation\u2019s governance panel has attested to this). The source of Vardhan\u2019s claims has been tracked to a Facebook page run by a user whose display name is Stephen Hawking, with a note that provides no sources for its contents. Additionally, in claiming what he did, Vardhan has also insulted the memory of Hawking, a staunch atheist and rationalist wholly antithetical to the idea of mixing religion and politics.\n\nWhat doing science means\n\nHarsh Vardhan\u2019s recklessly utilitarian conception of science \u2013 in which the only question he wants us to ask is \u201cWhat good is this to me?\u201d \u2013 has no space for science\u2019s non-functional value.\n\nHe and his government believe that when 0.8% of the country\u2019s GDP is being channeled into R&D, it is possible to ensure all of it is further channeled only into translational and/or technologisable outcomes by tweaking scholarship policies, tugging on higher-education infrastructure development and by announcements of intent. It is likely that the government is not stopping to think about whether science itself can work that way.\n\nIt can\u2019t. It will stall, splutter, choke on itself and blow up \u2013 particularly in a growth-minded country like India.\n\nIf Einstein had to be wondering about relativity just so he could make the world a better place, he might not have bothered with the question in the first place. But today, the mass-energy equivalence informs everything from nuclear power to manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nIt is also important that Einstein had to be selfish, self-absorbed, even privileged to some extent. No good can come of vilifying these attributes when it is clear to everyone that, with one\u2019s heart in the right place, enormous \u201cvalue\u201d can be created. But no, Vardhan and the administration to which he belongs have only displayed a lack of trust in the morality of India\u2019s scientists. Instead of letting science be what each scientist wants to achieve with its rules and apparatuses, with stringent quality control, accountability and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 an equitable vision for scientific research in the country, the government has been attempting to homogenise everyone\u2019s vision of science in the image of its own. And if you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\n\nThis is not going to end well. The moment is already upon us when reacting from strength of insight instead of from fear of criticism \u2013 to adapt Jay Rosen\u2019s criticism of the Times \u2013 is no longer an option. If not, we might as well all go to hell. Or whatever the Vedic equivalent of it is."

IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly quoted Mohamed Emad el-Kabbany, MSPV\u2019s assistant manager for sales and business development, as saying that Egypt is receiving between 2 000 and 3 000 Panthera T6s for its police and army.\n\nHe added that Egyptian company Eagles Defence International Systems (EDIS) is the company\u2019s Egyptian agent \u2013 in 2014 it was reported that EDIS was producing the Panthera T6, as well as the larger S10 and K10CMD.\n\nThe Panthera T6 was first seen in May 2014 during an Egyptian military parade and subsequently seen in the Sinai Peninsula. At least some have been fitted with electronic warfare equipment for use in the Sinai.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its Arms Transfers Database, lists 50 Panthera T6s being ordered from the UAE in 2013, with deliveries from 2014-2015.\n\nAccordign to MSPV, the Panthera T6 is powered by a 4 litre V6 petrol engine driving all four wheels through a five speed manual transmission. It seats two plus six, although other seating arrangements are available. Features include air conditioning, a remote controlled roof mounted search light and camera, optional gun ports and hatches.\n\nThe Panthera T6 is based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 79-series chassis. An optional mount on the roof can accommodate a machinegun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibya has apparently taken delivery of Panthera T6s donated by the United Arab Emirates. They were delivered in April 2016. The Panthera T6 was seen several times in March 2015 in use by the Libyan National Army. In September last year Indian security forces introduced the vehicle into service, particularly for security in Jammu and Kashmir."

    "text": "Angola is the customer for four Super Dvora Mk 3 patrol boats ordered from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in 2015.\n\nAt the time the deal was announced, IAI only said the vessels were going to an undisclosed African country and that they would be delivered in 2016.\n\nAccording to Angola\u2019s official government gazette published on 1 March this year, budget information has revealed that the country is spending $4.3 million on equipment for its Dvora vessels, including radars.\n\nThe Super Dvora Mk 3 is currently in service with several navies worldwide. The type has an overall length of 27 meters, a top speed in excess of 40 knots, and displaces approximately 50 tonnes. It has a range of over 1 000 nautical miles at 10 knots. The type can be armed with 20, 23, 25 or 30 mm cannons, 7.62 or 12.7 mm machineguns and 40 mm grenade launchers. These can be mounted on automatic turrets or manually aimed. Missiles can also be fitted. Accommodation provides for 12 crewmembers.\n\nThe Super Dvora MK 3 can be propelled by articulating surface drives (ASD) or waterjets. The ASD system enables operation in extremely shallow water at minimal drafts of 1.2 metres. The ASD system is also highly manoeuvrable, steering the craft with thrust vectoring.\n\nAngola\u2019s most recent budget also makes provision for the acquisition of six transport helicopters for $52 million and budgets $9.5 million for maritime patrol vessels. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Arms Transfers database, in 2016 Angola ordered several patrol vessels from France as part of a 495 million euro deal, but not much is known about this deal.\n\nIn 2016 Angola ordered two fast patrol craft from Whitehead Sistemi Subacquei for around 7 million euros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngola has already taken delivery of a number of helicopters over the last decade, including four A109K and two AW139 helicopters from AgustaWestland (Leonardo Helicopters) for use by the Navy; eight Mi-171Sh armed transport helicopters from Russia and 12 second hand and upgraded Mi-24P/Mi-35P attack helicopters from Russia.\n\n"

    "text": "Canada's multi-billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia includes a substantial number of \"heavy assault\" armoured vehicles and a maintenance deal that would see the Ontario-based manufacturer embed teams at multiple locations throughout the kingdom.\n\nCBC News has obtained documents that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 lay out the major elements of the original agreement signed in early 2014 and approved by the previous Conservative government.\n\nThe $15 billion agreement was given the further blessing of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in the spring of 2016 when it began issuing permits for the export of the combat vehicles.\n\nMuch of the heated public debate about the arms sale has taken place in a vacuum because specific details of General Dynamics Land Systems Canada's (GDLS) contract were sealed under a confidentiality agreement demanded by the Saudi government.\n\nBoth the Liberals and Conservatives have used the absence of details to downplay the destructive firepower of the vehicles being sold.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper once described them as \"trucks.\" Before the last election, Trudeau called them \"jeeps.\"\n\nCBC News has obtained internal records that show the deal struck in February 2014 involved 928 of the most modern light armoured vehicles, known as the LAV 6.\n\nOf those, almost 40 per cent \u2014 354 \u2014 are standard troop carriers.\n\nThe order also includes 119 LAV 6 vehicles of the \"heavy assault\" type, with powerful 105 millimetre canons affixed to their turrets, which were still under development at the time the documents were written.\n\nAnother 119 are configured as \"anti-tank\" vehicles and a further 119 are designated as \"direct fire\" support, with a two-man turret and 30 millimetre chain gun.\n\nThe remaining vehicles include ambulances, mobile command posts, VIP transports and recovery vehicles equipped with cranes.\n\nSaudis want details kept quiet\n\nThere has been talk in the defence industry that some details of the order have been modified over the last four years, and that it's possible fewer vehicles may be sold.\n\nThe company was asked to comment on the documents and the current status of the deal.\n\n\"General Dynamics declines to comment due to contractual and confidentiality reasons,\" said Doug Wilson-Hodge, manager of corporate affairs at General Dynamics Land Systems.\n\nDelivery of the first vehicles was slated to begin in early 2017, according to internal Global Affairs Canada emails obtained by CBC News under access to information legislation.\n\nThese are combat-ready vehicles ... certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were. - Cesar Jaramillo, Project Ploughshares\n\nThe government agency that brokered the deal \u2014 the Canadian Commercial Corporation \u2014 also refused to discuss the documents.\n\n\"All details of the contract remain commercially confidential,\" said an unsigned email from the agency.\n\n\"Further, the documents you mention below are not internal to CCC nor the Government of Canada, therefore, we decline to comment.\"\n\nInternal government emails, obtained in 2015 by The Globe and Mail, show the Saudis stipulated that releasing the details of the deal would amount to \"breaking the terms of the contract.\"\n\nStephen Harper personally reassured the late Saudi King Abdullah, in writing, that Ottawa would hold up its end of the bargain, the newspaper reported.\n\nDeal includes 14-year support program\n\nDefence experts and human rights advocates, particularly those who have fought the deal, said the documents represent the first clear snapshot the Canadian public has seen of what the government is allowing to be exported.\n\n\"These documents raise very important questions and I think our understanding of what was announced in 2014 has to change, needs to change,\" said Cesar Jaramillo, the executive director of Project Ploughshares.\n\n\"This shows us that these are combat-ready vehicles and certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were.\"\n\nA Southern People's Resistance militant loyal to Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi mans an anti-aircraft machine gun the militia seized from the army in al-Habilin, in Yemen's southern province of Lahej, March 22, 2015. There are concerns among human rights groups that the Saudis could use Canadian-made armoured vehicles against Houthi fighters in Yemen. (Nabeel Quaiti/Reuters)\n\nThe records obtained by CBC News show the contract between London, Ont.-based GDLS and the Saudis goes much deeper than just than just selling the vehicles.\n\nIt also involves a 14-year support program that covers ammunition, crew \"training in Canada/Europe\" and \"embedded\" maintenance, with a fleet management team in 13 workshops.\n\nThe reference to Europe has to do with training Saudi crews on the gun system, slated to take place in France.\n\nThe service agreement in Saudi Arabia would be delivered through a subsidiary of the Canadian manufacturer located in Riyadh, said the documents obtained by CBC News.\n\nThe support deal is significant on a couple of different levels, said Dave Perry, an expert in defence procurement at the Canadian Institute of Global Affairs.\n\nFor starters, it partly explains the enormous price tag. Most of the value in defence deals today is not in the hardware, but in the long-term maintenance and support services being provided, said Perry.\n\nIt could give Canada \"a fairly significant amount of leverage\" going forward, he added, pointing out that the support deal could be used to apply diplomatic pressure in the event Canada has new concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"If we are simply selling them a piece of equipment and walking away, you don't really have much recourse afterwards to do anything, if they do something that you don't want,\" he said.\n\nRe-examining arms exports\n\nLast summer, images surfaced online that showed Canadian-made armoured vehicles, manufactured by another company, being used by the Saudi state in its long-running conflict against the Shiite population in Qatif, a restive portion of eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of the video clips also showed a light armoured vehicle, apparently manufactured by GDLS, operating in the region of Awamiyah.\n\nThe Liberal government launched an investigation, which ended with \"no conclusive evidence that Canadian made vehicles were used in human rights violations.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland supported the findings, but told a House of Commons committee a few weeks ago that the review caused her to re-examine the arms export system.\n\nAt the same time, the Liberal government introduced amendments to Bill C-47, which allows Canada to join the global arms trade treaty. The changes would, when passed, give the federal cabinet broader powers to deny export permits if there is the \"substantial risk\" of human rights violations.\n\nReleasing the report\n\nFreeland has shown no appetite to revisit the Saudi deal.\n\n\"Let's be clear, from this day forward, I want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard on the export of controlled goods from Canada,\" Freeland said. \"On a matter of principle, Canada will honour, to the greatest extent possible, pre-existing contracts. We can all understand and appreciate the fundamental importance of being able to trust Canada.\"\n\nOfficials in Freeland's office would not answer questions directly related to the leaked documents on Monday. Instead, a spokesman pointed to the ongoing debate over over Bill C-47.\n\n\"We are committed to a new and higher standard for arms exports,\" Adam Austin said in an email.\n\nJaramillo said it would be in the public's interest for the Liberals to release a copy of their recent investigation and to explain how they came to the conclusion that no abuse took place in eastern Saudi Arabia involving Canadian vehicles.\n\nReleasing that investigation report, he said, shouldn't have any effect on the current sale.\n\n\"Before they invoke commercial confidentiality, to shield the Canadian public from this important information, I just want to point out that I don't see how an independent government investigation into human rights violations would interfere at all with the commercial confidentiality of GDLS,\" he said."

It is fitted with a 30 mm CRN-91 cannon, 12.7 mm heavy machineguns and 7.62 mm machineguns. It has a top speed of 37 knots and endurance of seven days. It is powered by three MTU-F 16V4000 M90 diesel engines that drive three KAMEWA Type-71SII waterjets.\n\nCGS Valiant is the second of two fast patrol vessels ordered from GSL, with CGS Victory having been handed over to the Mauritius National Coast Guard (NCG) in September 2016. The India Import-Export Bank helped fund the $41 million order.\n\nMauritius in December last year commissioned into service CGS Victory as well as two Chetak helicopters from India for its Police Helicopter Squadron. The two refurbished helicopters were donated by the Indian government in line with India\u2019s commitment to augment the capacities of the Mauritius Police Force, including in the critical area of search and rescue.\n\nIn March last year the island nation strengthened its maritime capabilities with the commissioning of ten 14.5 metre Fast Interceptor Boats (FIBs) from GSL. The bulk of the FIBs will be used to conduct day and night patrols and periodic Special Forces Operations (SFOs) in shallow waters. Each boat has a top speed of 35 knots with a cruising speed of 20 knots, along with an endurance of over 200 km. The boats were ordered along with machineguns, ammunition and body armour for the crews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mauritius National Coast Guard on 14 July last year inducted a third Do 228 aircraft into service to patrol the nation\u2019s coastline."

    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's foundation, the company's largest shareholder, pledged to work with unions and management to appoint a successor to its chairman Ulrich Lehner.\n\nThyssenkrupp has been gradually dismantling its complex submarines-to-elevators business and last month merged its European steel assets with those of rival Tata, further retreating from a core business.\n\nShareholders are pushing for a radical overhaul, urging the Essen, Germany-based conglomerate to consider selling its elevators business and materials services division, which distributes non-ferrous metals, alloys and stainless steel.\n\nMajor restructuring moves have been opposed by workers and Thyssenkrupp's management. The company employs 158,000 in businesses ranging from food packaging to naval vessels and industrial services.\n\nBelow are stakeholders with the power to influence Thyssenkrupp's fate:\n\nALFRIED KRUPP VON BOHLEN AND HALBACH FOUNDATION\n\nThe foundation is Thyssenkrupp's biggest shareholder with a 21 percent stake. It has 11 members and is headed by Ursula Gather, rector of the University of Dortmund, who also sits on the Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board.\n\nThe foundation is tasked with preserving the \"unity\" of Thyssenkrupp and uses proceeds from Thyssenkrupp's dividend payments to further good causes in science and education.\n\nThe foundation was set up after former chief executive Berthold Beitz persuaded the last member of the Krupp family, Arndt von Bohlen, to put the family shareholding into a foundation tasked with promoting the common good.\n\nCritics say that the unity of the conglomerate has long been compromised with the sale of VDM Group, Steel Americas and the merger of European steel assets with Tata.\n\nThe foundation on Tuesday reiterated it will work with labour representatives and the company's management to develop a long-term strategy for the conglomerate.\n\nGerman newspaper Handelsblatt reported at the weekend that Gather had held talks with the largest shareholder of Kone on a potential merger of the two companies' elevator businesses.\n\nThe first conversations took place as early as two years ago but the idea was rebuffed by Hiesinger, who wanted to hold on to Thyssenkrupp's most profitable division, Handelsblatt reported.\n\nCEVIAN\n\nSwedish activist investor Cevian holds an 18 percent stake in Thyssenkrupp.\n\nLars Foerberg, founding partner of Cevian Capital, on Tuesday said: \"All great and enduring companies renew themselves, taking advantage of their strengths while adapting to new challenges and opportunities. As a large and long-term owner of Thyssenkrupp, Cevian Capital looks forward to supporting the company in achieving these objectives for the benefit of all Thyssenkrupp stakeholders.\"\n\nHe had renewed his call for deeper restructuring efforts a day after Thyssen struck its steel deal with Tata.\n\n\"There is now an urgent need and opportunity to address the significant and persistent underperformance of the industrial businesses,\" he said on July 1, adding that Thyssenkrupp could be valued at the equivalent of 50 euros ($58.5) per share.\n\nWORKERS\n\nUnions hold half the seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and any deal depends on their support, which Thyssenkrupp has so far won through major concessions regarding job guarantees and a pledge not to close factories. Together with representatives from the Krupp foundation, they have the power to block major strategic moves.\n\nWilhelm Segerath, head of the Thyssenkrupp works council and a senior official in the IG Metall industrial trade union, on Monday said he regretted the departure of Lehner but understood his move.\n\nELLIOTT\n\nThe U.S. activist investor has said it sees \"significant scope for operational improvement\" at Thyssenkrupp.\n\nElliott has a stake of below 3 percent according to its latest filing. It declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nCHAIRMAN ULRICH LEHNER\n\nThyssenkrupp's chairman resigned late on Monday, with his departure effective at the end of the month. Lehner signalled that there had been a clash with not just activist shareholders, but also with the Krupp foundation.\n\n\"The confidence of the major shareholders and a joint understanding within the Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of Thyssenkrupp were the basis for my work and a pre-requisite for my promise to Berthold Beitz to successfully further develop the company in the interest of customers, employees and shareholders. This is now no longer given,\" Lehner said in a statement late on Monday.\n\n\"I take this step consciously to enable a fundamental discussion with our shareholders on the future of Thyssenkrupp. My decision may contribute to creating the necessary awareness with all concerned parties that a break-up of the company and the related loss of many jobs is not an option - neither in the interest of the founder, nor in the interest of the country.\"\n\nLehner's remarks echoed a similar statement from former Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger on July 5, when he resigned, saying a \"joint understanding of board and supervisory board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company\".\n\n($1 = 0.8551 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff in Duesseldorf, Arno Schuetze and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; editing by Louise Heavens/Keith Weir)"

    "text": "LONDON \u2014 Britain needs to raise defense spending by over \u00a38 billion a year, or U.S. $10.59 billion, to not undermine the military relationship with the U.S. says a report by the parliamentary defence committee.\n\nThe report, which looks at the U.K.\u2019s defense relations with the U.S. and NATO, recommends Britain increases the percentage of gross domestic product being allocated to the military first to 2.5 percent and eventually 3 percent if the country is to maintain the military relationship with the U.S. and keep its leading role in NATO.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. armed forces and the Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the U.S. However, that will continue to be true only while the U.K. military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the U.S. military and to relieve U.S. burdens. For this to be the case the U.K. armed forces must be funded appropriately,\u201d said the report released June 26.\n\nThe lawmakers urged a significant rise in a defense budget which currently just manages to squeeze above the 2 percent of gross domestic product demanded by NATO for defense spending.\n\nExcluded from cooperative plans in Europe, UK sets groundwork for future fighters Left out in the cold by a joint Franco-German plan to develop a new fighter, British officials have been working for months on a combat air strategy to sustain Britain\u2019s capabilities beyond the Eurofighter Typhoon, and they are determined to figure out a way forward this summer.\n\n\u201cWe calculate that raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP would result in a forecast spend of \u00a350 billion per annum and raising it to 3% of GDP would take this to \u00a360 billion per annum,\u201d said the lawmakers.\n\nThe defense budget this year is set at \u00a337 billion with small real term increases expected annually up to 2022.\n\nA rise to 3 percent would see defence spending return to a level \u2014 in GDP percentage terms \u2014 that has not been seen since 1995.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe release of the document comes at a bad time for anyone advocating increases in defense spending here.\n\nLast week Chancellor Philip Hammond, an ex-defense secretary, revealed plans to spend an additional \u00a320 billion a year on health care and made it clear that there was little or nothing left to bolster the finances of other departments, including defense.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson has been battling for months to secure additional funding to fill a black hole that the National Audit Office, the government\u2019s financial watchdog, has previously estimated could be anything between \u00a34.8 billion and \u00a320 billion in equipment spending alone over the next decade.\n\nThe exact amount depends to some degree on how much the military can save in efficiency improvements and reprioritizing and cutting capabilities and programs.\n\nThe headline outcomes of a Minstry of Defence review into the future size and shape of British forces, officially called the Modernising Defence Programme, could come at the NATO summit scheduled for Brussels starting July 11.\n\nMedia reports Sunday on the defense funding battle highlighted the seemingly growing rift between Williamson and senior government figures over the issue.\n\nThe reports followed strong denials from Prime Minister Theresa May last week that the government here was considering a watering down of Britain\u2019s \u2018tier-one\u2019 status as a military power after the Financial Times reported that May asked Williamson to justify continuance of that position.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, right, speaks to a group of soldiers of the NATO Battle Group at the Tapa military base in Estonia on Sept. 29, 2017. She was guaranteeing Britain's security commitment to the other 27 European Union leaders. (Marko Mumm/AP)\n\nThe U.S, Britain, China, Russia and France are the only nations with a tier one status \u2014 which basically means they are able to fight nuclear, conventional and other conflicts around the world.\n\nThe committee said military-to-military engagement between the U.K. and the U.S. was one of the linchpins of the bilateral relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe report said the U.K. benefits greatly from the width and depth of the U.K.-U.S. defense and security relationship, but such a relationship requires a degree of interoperability that can be sustained only through investment in U.K. armed forces.\n\nThe importance of the military relationship between the U.S. and Europe\u2019s leading military power also extends into NATO.\n\nLawmakers said the relationship is vital to the functioning of NATO while the U.K.\u2019s leading contribution to the alliance helps to sustain the relationship between London and Washington.\n\nJulian Lewis, the Defence Committee chairman, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cDefence spending is an area where a strong message needs to be sent to our allies and adversaries alike. The Government has consistently talked about increasing the U.K.\u2019s commitment to NATO after our departure from the European Union. An increased commitment, in the face of new and intensified threats, means that further investment is essential,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nThe warning in the report over the risks to the military relationship between London and Washington follows a similar warning in February by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis that Britain had to retain a credible military if the relationship between the two nations was to endure and strengthen.\n\nWilliamson said that in financial terms alone the U.K. benefits to the tune of \u00a33 billion a year from the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship.\n\nJohn Spellar MP, the Defence Committee\u2019s senior Labour Party member and former armed forces minister said the inquiry has \u201cunderlined the importance of the U.K.-U.S. relationship in the area of defense and security and emphasizes the benefit which the U.K. receives as a result.\u201d"

    "text": "The government must lift the ban on media access and ensure that the repatriation of refugees is acceptable to the international community.\n\nBy SITHU AUNG MYINT | FRONTIERWHEN THE National League for Democracy government took office in March 2016, there was intense interest in its plans for developing the economy.State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi decided that economic development depended on ending decades of civil war and made the pursuit of peace the government\u2019s top priority, a cause to which she has devoted much time and energy.The NLD government\u2019s efforts to attract foreign investment, which included legislative reforms, received a boost when the United States lifted all remaining economic sanctions against Myanmar in September 2016. The next month, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army launched the first of a coordinated series of attacks on security posts in northern Rakhine State.They were followed by another series of attacks last August, which led to a massive military counter-insurgency operation that triggered the exodus of more than 688,000 Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh. Many Myanmar initially believed that conflict and violence in a remote corner of the country was unlikely to have a negative impact on economic development, but it is now clear they were wrong. This week I\u2019d like to discuss the adverse effects of the Rakhine crisis on the economy.In a shock decision on February 1, Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose, the Myanmar affiliate of a New York-based law firm, announced that it was closing its Yangon office at the end of the month. In 2013, it became the first American law firm to open for business in Myanmar amid the high expectations for economic growth fuelled by foreign investment after the country began its transition to democracy in 2011.HRMR\u2019s lead director, Mr Eric Rose, was quoted as saying there were three main reasons that influenced the decision to close shop in Myanmar. In lengthy interviews withand, he cited government inaction on the economy, the Rakhine crisis, and remaining US financial sanctions together with the suspension of the European Union-Myanmar investment protection agreement.It is clear that economic development has been adversely affected by the situation in Rakhine. Rose said the Rakhine crisis, particularly the flight of more than 750,000 refugees, had created a reputational risk that deterred Western companies from investing in Myanmar. The risk was \u201cin particular due to the lack of a coherent response from the Myanmar government\u201d to the situation in Rakhine, he toldThe Rakhine crisis is not only a border problem, a religious and ethnic problem, a human rights problem and a sovereignty problem, but a problem that is directly related to economic development. That it was a factor in the decision to close the Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose office after five years is an indication of the importance of solving the Rakhine problem.What needs to be done to address the problem that has attracted intense domestic and international interest?Media coverage of the violence in northern Rakhine after the August attacks last year has had a negative effect on Myanmar\u2019s international image. It has included accounts of atrocities against Muslims and the burning of their homes to drive them out of the country.Initially, the government and the Tatmadaw denied allegations of human rights abuses during the counter-insurgency operation. Then news emerged of the massacre at Inn Din village in Maungdaw Township on September 2 last year. An exhaustive account of the Inn Din massacre published byon February 8 included interviews with Buddhist villagers who admitted torching Muslim homes, burying bodies and killing Muslims.The report also included the accounts by security personnel of their role in an operation to drive Muslims from the village.said it was the first time soldiers and paramilitary police were implicated by testimony from other security personnel.A week before the Reuters investigation was published,reported that there were at least five mass graves containing the bodies of Muslims at Gu Dar Pyin village in Buthidaung Township. The report said that before victims were thrown into mass graves, acid was poured on their faces to prevent them from being identified.On February 2, the government denied the report, saying a clash at the village on August 27 last year had resulted in the deaths of 19 \u201cterrorists\u201d who had been \u201ccarefully buried\u201d by the security forces. The Rakhine State government threatened to suewhich said it stood by its reporting.On media coverage, there is only one way forward. The ban on media access to northern Rakhine must be lifted so that the international community may learn the truth about what happened during the counter-insurgency operation launched after the August 25 attacks.The Annan commission on Rakhine recommended \u201cfull and regular\u201d media access, saying that the ban was counterproductive. Media access has also been urged by former Thai foreign minister, Mr Surakiart Sathirathai, who heads a board appointed by the government to advise the committee formed to implement the Annan commission recommendations.Another important issue is the repatriation and resettlement of refugees, which must be accomplished successfully, no matter how many difficulties need to be overcome. Muslims should be resettled where they had lived before they fled Myanmar and be able to live without fear.The repatriation process must be conducted in a way that is acceptable to the international community. Otherwise, the Rakhine problem will continue to hinder economic development in Myanmar.who are they ?"

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\n\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped.\n\n\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\n\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\n\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\n\nNATO SUMMIT\n\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\n\u201cCertain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\u201d Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\n\u201cBecause Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\n\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\n\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\n\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\n\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey\u2019s November target date for operations.\n\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\n\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \u201cto delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\u201d"

    "text": "The recent release of the latest Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report on t\ufeffhe worldwide trade in weapon systems has observers in Moscow asking unhappy questions. Their chief concern is that gains made in 2012-2017 by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in different regions are ultimately at the expense of sales that might otherwise have been made by Russian suppliers.\n\nThe issue was addressed in the last week of March by the editors of the Russian-language Nezavisimoye Voyennoe Obozreniye (NVO), one of the nation\u2019s most authoritative defense periodicals. The PRC\u2019s previous market share has been small, the editors write, and the nation has been more along the lines of a large-scale importer of weapons\u2014particularly those from Russian manufacturers.\n\nWhat has become the cause for worry, says the publication, is that \u201cin a short historical period of time, Beijing has made a sharp turn upwards and has broken into the ranks of the top five leading exporters\u2014turning the process of military-technical cooperation with foreign nations into an effective instrument of political and economic influence.\u201d\n\nThe PRC, the report notes, has made considerable investments in its defense industrial base. The increase in the number of arms exports has been accompanied by a commensurate improvement in the overall qualitative and technological ranking of the PRC\u2019s weapon systems. This telegraphs the \u201cserious objectives of the military and political leadership of the PRC to transform the country into a world-class power in all respects.\u201d\n\nThe PRC has had its traditional customers over the years, some of which were left to the Chinese, as they were nations that Russia found it inconvenient to cultivate as clients. The most prevalent of them is Pakistan. Sales by Moscow to Islamabad would undoubtedly damage relations with India, one of the longest-running and most profitable relationships for sale of Russian military hardware.\n\nHowever, what has driven the PRC\u2019s success in foreign sales is not Pakistan, but rather markets where Beijing is positioned to displace Russia as the main source of weaponry. Two developments mentioned in the NVO commentary were the recent sale of air defense systems to Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, and the announced intention in 2013 by Turkey to purchase an export version of the PRC\u2019s CASIC HQ-9, which is designated FD-2000 in the export configuration. The PRC is also blamed for \u201cblocking efforts by Russia to make significant inroads into selling military hardware to Indonesia.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the Turks to purchase a Chinese-made air defense system has been a sore point with Russian industry because the HQ-9 is a reverse-engineered copy of the Russian-made Almaz-Antei S-300. Furthermore, the follow-on model to the S-300 from Almaz-Antei, the S-400 system, was one of the other competing options presented to the Turks in the tender. Ultimately, the Turkish decision was overturned and they did not carry through with the procurement, buying the S-400 instead, but more than one Russian commentator has singled out this particular incident as a harbinger of future events.\n\nRussian defense industry analysts who spoke to AIN point out that Moscow may well be incapable of escaping this future, as Russia continues to sell some of its most advanced weaponry to the PRC. These are, most notably, the Sukhoi Su-35 Super-Flanker and the same S-400 air defense system that has been offered to other potential export customers.\n\n\u201cThe lure of making money has consistently overridden national security concerns and just plain common sense when it comes to selling our defense technology to the PRC,\u201d said one aerospace industry specialist in Moscow. \u201cNo one learned their lesson apparently when the Chinese spent the 1990s copying the Su-27. They then reneged on the 1996 contract to build 200 Su-27s under license\u2014as well as their obligation to pay the license fee per aircraft to the OEM\u2014after having built slightly more than half of the 200 Su-27s they had signed for. There is now every reason to believe that history will repeat itself with the Su-35.\u201d\n\nOthers point to the PRC\u2019s aircraft carrier program, almost all of which is based on Soviet/\ufeffRussian or Ukrainian-developed design know-how. The PLAN\u2019s sole operational carrier, the Type 001 CV-16 Liaoning, was originally built in the USSR as the Varyag, the sister ship to the Russian Navy\u2019s only carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, later purchased by Beijing from the now-independent nation of Ukraine, was refitted in the PLAN\u2019s Dalian shipyards and then was copied to became the basis for the Type 001A CV-17 Shandong, a near copy of the Ukrainian original.\n\nThe Liaoning also operates the Shenyang J-15 carrier-capable fighter, itself a copy of the Sukhoi Su-33 that is flown off Kuznetsov. Another example in a consistent pattern of either cloning Russian hardware one-to-one or making close-copies that are then embellished with \u201cChinese characteristics.\"\n\n\u201cChinese weapon systems are going to continue to improve,\u201d said the aerospace specialist. \u201cThose who are worried about their chances of pushing Russia out of one arms market after another are not worrying for nothing.\u201d"

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 The French Armed Forces Minister called July 23 for industry to play a greater role in servicing heavily used military vehicles, with companies called to support 40 percent of the mixed fleet by the middle of the next decade.\n\nSpeaking at Bruz, a base for vehicle support in western France, Minister Florence Parly said the service goal compares to the present 15 percent, with a target of 2025.\n\nThe minister announced a \u201ctransformation plan\u201d for vehicle support based on an official report by defense procurement official Vincent Imbert and Army Gen. Bernard Guillet.\n\n\"The improvement of our maintenance process and availability of our equipment is one of my priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nThat call for greater support reflects problems in servicing a highly mixed fleet, including new-generation armored vehicles to be delivered in the Scorpion program, modern VBCI infantry fighting vehicles and Caesar truck-mounted artillery, and an aging park of VAB troop carriers and VBL scout cars.\n\nThe plan seeks to boost the availability of vehicles by restructuring the industrial and technological base for service, boost a sense of responsibility of the personnel using the vehicles, and reshaping links between the armed forces and industry, the ministry said in a briefing note. There are also plans to increase local support in the deployed theaters and adopt new technology in monitoring and predicting breakdowns.\n\nThere is a high availability of more than 90 percent for vehicles in overseas operations, but those vehicles return to France in poor condition, with only 65 percent of the various fleets available for use once back on national territory, the ministry said. That availability varies greatly depending on the type of vehicle.\n\nThat means there is a lack of vehicles for training troops for deployment. Some 3,500 vehicles are broken down and there is a lack of capability to reduce that number. The British and German forces face similar problems, with lower availability and lack of an organization to improve the situation, the ministry said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe modernization plan calls for closer ties between government maintenance organizations, the armed forces and manufacturers including Arquus, Nexter, Safran and Thales, as well as specialist NSE and small- and medium-sized enterprises, the ministry said. Those actors should use more efficient tools and methods, and cut out duplication and waste of resources and time.\n\nA French military modernization program is getting a makeover Scorpion is seen as more than just bringing in new vehicles and equipment, as the French Army is rewriting the concept of operations to adapt to new technology.\n\nThe official report pointed up a \u201clack of sense of responsibility\u201d of the users as the vehicles are held in pools rather than assigned specifically, a contrast to an attachment of Air Force and Navy personnel who are closely tied to their aircraft and ships.\n\nCompanies showed a weak link with service support in the land sector, also in contrast to ties seen between industry and the naval and aeronautical sectors, the report said.\n\nThere should be greater use of new technology, adopting 3D printing and the use of health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) to predict breakdowns, the report said. Development under the Scorpion program offered industry an opportunity not to be missed to incorporate such technology.\n\nThe report called for equipment which was beyond repair to be handed over to industry to repair and resell, with the money to be shared between the government and industry.\n\n\"This reform requires a mobilization and a greater responsibility of industry in their performance and their capacity to honor the client\u2019s needs, whose objective is both to be effective on the ground and to guarantee the safety of soldiers,\u201d Parly said.\n\nSome 13,000 personnel are employed on vehicle service, with 11,000 in the armed forces. The balance is split between two government organizations \u2014 SMITer and SIMMT. The latter awards service contracts to companies.\n\nSome \u20ac1 billion (US $1.2 billion) has been earmarked for land vehicle service in the 2019-2015 defense budget law."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials are planning to increase military spending for fiscal 2020 by using temporary war funding accounts to get around federal budget caps, a controversial move that could undermine negotiations with lawmakers.\n\nIn an essay for Real Clear Politics on Monday, acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought wrote that the move is needed because \u201cDemocrats insist on demanding more social spending in exchange for continuing to fund defense spending,\u201d while President Donald Trump has called for cuts.\n\n\u201cExpanding the use of (overseas contingency) funds remains the administration\u2019s only fiscally responsible option in meeting national security needs while avoiding yet another increase to the spending caps,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe acknowledged that the move is likely to make fiscal conservatives \u201cuncomfortable\u201d but called it necessary given political opposition to Trump\u2019s past fiscal plans.\n\nTrump changes his mind again on military spending, now wants a big boost next year The president is expected this week to announce plans for $750 billion in fiscal 2020 military spending, a huge jump from previous targets.\n\nThe move comes as several lawmakers and budget analysts have pushed for reductions in the temporary war funding accounts, designed to cover only the ongoing operations overseas.\n\nCritics say that because the accounts aren\u2019t affected by congressionally mandated spending caps, they have become a hiding place for a host of desired program resets and expansions by the Pentagon.\n\nThe size of the war accounts has shrunk in recent years, from more than $100 billion in fiscal 2017 to less than $69 billion this fiscal year. Vought did not specify how large the president\u2019s request for fiscal 2020 will be, but Politico reported the fund could top $174 billion.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIn the last few months, Trump has discussed a 5 percent cut for all federal agencies next fiscal year, as well as a $750 billion defense budget, an increase of more than 4 percent. The president and conservative defense lawmakers have argued the money is needed to rebuild military might after more than 17 years of war.\n\nBut congressional Democrats have already panned the military proposal as too high and said that adequate appropriations for the Departments of State and Homeland Security are as critical to national security as Pentagon spending. They have promised to make funding parity a key point of upcoming budget negotiations.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., blasted the war funding reports as \u201ca gimmick to prop up defense spending\u201d by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a blatant attempt to make a mockery of the federal budget process, obscure the true cost of military operations, and severely shortchange other investments vital to our national and economic security,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nIn the last two fiscal years, lawmakers reached a compromise on defense and non-defense spending levels to avoid spending caps put in place in 2011. But those caps return again next fiscal year and limit defense spending to $576 billion and nondefense spending to $542 billion.\n\nVought said raising the cap for defense spending is necessary but lifting it for the other programs \u201cwould be a bad deal for taxpayers.\u201d He called the national debt a looming crisis for the country.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Congress to join the president in his commitment to cutting spending, reducing bloated deficits, and getting our national debt under control,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s future generations are depending on them.\u201d"

    "text": "Saab has been awarded a follow-on contract from India\u2019s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for IDAS-2 self-protection systems for the Dhruv advanced light helicopters it is building for the Indian Army.\n\nSaab on 8 August said the order is worth around SEK350 million ($39 million) and includes the IDAS-2 (Integrated Defensive Aids Suite). Production will take place at Saab\u2019s facility in Centurion, South Africa, with deliveries to begin during 2019.\n\n\u201cThis follow-on order confirms our successful partnership with HAL and further establishes Saab as a local partner to the Indian industry,\u201d said Anders Carp, head of Saab business area Surveillance.\n\nSaab has been awarded several follow-on IDAS contracts for India in the past, after receiving initial serial production orders in December 2008 worth $24 million. For instance, it received contracts worth $33 million in September 2013 and $78 million in March 2015.\n\nIDAS warns against radar, laser and infrared (IR) guided threats and automatically deploys appropriate countermeasures. IDAS has been designed for both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Saab also produces protection systems for both land and naval applications.\n\n\u201cThe system has a long and successful history with proven capability on many airborne platforms. This order strengthens our position as a supplier of high-tech systems to the Indian Armed forces,\u201d said Trevor Raman, head of Saab Grintek Defence.\n\nSaab says IDAS has been chosen for many different airborne platforms, including the Saab 2000, AW109, Super Lynx 300, Boeing CH-47 Chinook, Denel Rooivalk and Oryx, Eurocopter Cougar, Puma & Super Puma, NH Industries NH90, C-130 and L100 Hercules, and Sukhoi Su-30MKM.\n\nIn June last year Saab Grintek Defence said it will produce the IDAS for H225M Caracal multirole utility helicopters under a new contract from Airbus Helicopters. Deliveries are scheduled for 2020.\n\nSaab is looking at installing IDAS aboard other helicopters made by HAL, such as its Light Combat Helicopter, and expects more IDAS sales from India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAL has been building the Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) since 2002 and in December 2017 it had almost completed the initial order of 159 aircraft for the Army and Air Force. In September 2017 it was given another contract for 41 Dhruvs worth $952 million \u2013 40 for the Army and one for the Navy. That followed a March 2017 order for 32 Dhruvs for the Navy and Coast Guard. Production of the improved Dhruv Mk III is underway as well as the armed Rudra version for the Air Force and Army."

    "text": "Algeria evaluating Chinese CH-4 UAV\n\nDenel Seeker 400 takes to the skies\n\nWritten by defenceWeb, Tuesday, 11 March 2014Algerian is evaluating the Chinese CH-4 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is reportedly very interested in acquiring the type, which can be armed with guided weapons.The CH-4, developed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA), has been undergoing testing with the Algerian military for some months, according to Air Forces Daily. One is reported to have crashed during testing at the Algerian Air Force\u2019s base at Tindouf several months ago while a second one crashed on Sunday at the Ain Oussera Air Base. The UAV came down 100 metres short of the runway whilst preparing to land.In spite of the crashes, Algeria is apparently still very interested in acquiring the CH-4 (Cai Hong 4 or Rainbow 4), which appears to have been inspired by the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. The UAV, with a takeoff weight of 1.3 tons and a payload of 350 kg, has a wingspan of 18 metres and a length of 8.5 metres. Top speed is 235 km/h and operational altitude is 3000-3500 metres, according to officially released data, while combat radius is 2000 km and endurance is 36 hours.CAAA technical staff claim the CH-4 has four hard points capable of carrying two AR-1 laser-guided missiles and two FT-5 small guided bombs.The CH-4 was first seen at the Zuhai airshow in 2012 and in the absence of Chinese military interest it seems the aircraft is aimed at the export market.Algeria has reportedly also been in discussions with China over the purchase of Xianglong unmanned aerial vehicles. Echorouk quoted an unnamed Algerian defence ministry colonel as saying that the UAV was successfully tested in Tamanrasset, southern Algeria, last year.The Xianglong (Soar Dragon) is a jet-powered High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft designed by the Guizhou Aircraft Corporation of China, initially for use by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force. The Xianglong has a length of 14 metres, a height of 5 metres and a wingspan of 25 metres. It has a top speed of 750 km/h, endurance of up to 10 hours, and a maximum range of 7 000 km.Tactical Weekly earlier this year reported that the Algerian Defence Ministry is said to have decided to go ahead with a programme to buy 90 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including attack UAVs.Last year, Algeria expressed interest in the Adcom Systems Yabhon United 40 Block 5 UAV from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to meet its Medium-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) requirement. According to Algerian daily El Watan, Algeria is negotiating with Russia to purchase 30 E95 unmanned aerial vehicles/target drones from Russia.Algeria is looking for aerial reconnaissance platforms to track down various Maghreb-based terrorist groups, drug and arms traffickers and militants who have taken advantage of post-war chaos in Mali and Libya to destabilise the Sahel-Maghreb region.Algeria currently flies Denel Seeker II UAVs and is believed to have ordered one new Seeker 400 system with three aircraft. The Seeker 400 is currently undergoing flight testing.The North African country has previously expressed interest in General Atomics Predator/Reaper UAVs. It also has six King Air 350ER surveillance aircraft fitted with Gabbiano T-200 radars, Wescam Mx15i infrared cameras and other features for maritime and ground surveillance.Since war clouds started gathering over northern Mali in November 2012, the Algerian army has deployed more than 12 000 personnel to secure the borders with Mali, Libya and Niger.Algeria has increased its defence budget for 2014 and is actively seeking new tankers, transports, helicopters and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. Last year Algeria evaluated the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport and Airbus A330 MRTT tanker with an eye to replacing ageing Il-78 Midas tankers and acquiring a new transport aircraft. Algeria asked the two respective companies to conduct demonstrations, indicating the seriousness of these potential contracts.Algeria is growing its defence spending by 6% through 2017, according to some estimates, as it modernises and re-equips to meet the challenge of insecurity and terrorism in the region.....Written by Guy Martin, Wednesday, 26 February 2014Denel\u2019s new Seeker 400 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) completed its first round of flight tests earlier this month at the Alkantpan test range in the Northern Cape, after a three year development process.The test flights were successful and will be followed by another round of testing in March ahead of production starting around the second half of this year.\u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Denel and again confirms our global leadership position in the design and manufacturing of UAVs,\u201d said Tsepo Monaheng, the CEO of Denel Dynamics.The Seeker 400 was originally due to fly a couple of years ago but was delayed due to contracting and certification issues, according to manufacturer Denel Dynamics. Denel\u2019s annual report for the 2012/13 financial year also identified \u201ccomplexities with the key subsystems\u201d as another reason for \u201csignificant variation in the programme schedule, including a delay of the maiden flight test.\u201dThe Seeker 400 was displayed in mock-up form at the 2010 Africa Aerospace and Defence exhibition. It has an endurance of 16 hours, a ceiling of 18 000 feet and a cruising speed is 150 km/h. Denel Dynamics says it is inaudible at altitudes higher than 1 000 metres above the ground and invisible to someone on the ground when flying at typical operating altitudes of between 4 500 and 9 000 feet.The Seeker 400 can carry 100 kg and this can include two payloads at the same time, including electro-optical/infrared and radar as well as a laser rangefinder and illuminator for target designation. Denel says an electronic surveillance payload is available for the detection and location of radar emitters. Future upgrades will include satellite communications, and sense-and-avoid capability in order to obtain civil aviation certification.Currently, the Seeker 400 has a range of 250 km, because it uses only line-of-sight communications, but it could be upgraded to use satellite communications, which would allow it to operate at much greater ranges. With the use of the existing tactical ground station (TGS), the range may be extended to 750 km.Denel Dynamics is executing a production contract for the UAV\u2019s launch customer (which previously operated the Seeker I) and has also attracted strong interest from other potential clients, with most demand expected to come from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South America. Denel is promoting the Seeker 400 to Seeker II customers, as the new UAV can be flown with Seeker II control stations.Monaheng said the Seeker 400 is a highlight in South Africa\u2019s development of local UAVs, which started in the mid-1980s. Its forerunner, the Seeker II, has been deployed in operational service by international clients, including in Afghanistan. The Seeker was also the first UAV in the world cleared for operations in controlled airspace when it was deployed to monitor potential hotspots during South Africa\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994.The Seeker II has undergone further developments by Denel Dynamics, and has since rebranded as the Seeker 200, and offered to clients who require a medium endurance and dual payload capability offered by the latest version."

    "text": "TOKYO -- Japan is considering selling air defense radar technology to the Philippines in what would be its first export of defense equipment since ending a nearly 50-year ban in 2014.\n\nTokyo is sounding out the Philippines about buying an upgraded model of the Mitsubishi Electric-made FPS-3 air defense radar system, which Japan's Air Self-Defense Force has used since 1991 in missile defense and monitoring airspace incursions. Tokyo has already begun offering technical information on the system to Manila.\n\nJapan's thinking goes that upgrading the less-than-cutting-edge radar to meet the Philippines' needs will keep costs down, helping it win orders. The price is expected to be between 1 billion yen and 2 billion yen ($8.87 million and $17.7 million). Manila has also approached the U.S. and Israel on the matter, according to a source connected to the Japanese government, and may decide as early as the start of next year.\n\nJapan's defense cooperation with the Philippines, which had centered on joint military exercises, has expanded into defense equipment in recent years. In March, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force donated TC-90 trainer craft to the Philippine navy. And Japan agreed in June to grant parts for multi-mission UH-1H helicopters formerly used by the Ground Self-Defense Force to the Philippine air force.\n\nThe two sides are interested in partnering on maritime security as China continues to build up its military presence in the South China Sea, a vital sea lane for goods and energy shipments for both Tokyo and Manila. By exporting air-defense radars to the Philippines, Japan hopes to improve the Southeast Asian country's detection and surveillance capabilities and help maintain safety in the region.\n\nJapan essentially banned arms exports for decades until April 2014, when the cabinet laid out basic rules letting the country transfer defense equipment and technology and participate in international joint development under certain conditions, such as when it contributes to Japan's security. Selling the radars to the Philippines was judged appropriate because it would further bilateral defense cooperation.\n\nTokyo has not yet sold any defense equipment under the new rules. Japan sought to build submarines for export to Australia, but lost the deal to France in 2016. An effort to sell P-1 patrol jets to the U.K. also fell through, and Japan lost a bid to supply radar for the Thai air force to a Spanish company."

    "text": "Taipei has a new idea instead: the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nTAIPEI - Taiwan\u2019s air force will cease campaigning for the F-35 Lightning stealth fighter aircraft and will, instead, reissue a request to the U.S. government for F-16 fighters.\n\nThe new proposal will push for the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nThis is, in part, a resurrection of an abandoned effort to procure sixty-six F-16C/D Block 50/52s killed by the Obama administration due to Chinese pressure. Beijing had dubbed the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan a \u201cred line\u201d and has repeatedly threatened to invade the self-ruled island.\n\nThe new campaign will also request co-production and performance-based logistics (PBL) as part of the overall package. PBL would improve combat effectiveness by 80 percent, say Taiwan defense industry sources.\n\nOne source said PBL was a \u201ccritical part of the package\u2026we must have it.\u201d\n\nThe package is consistent with Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s indigenous defense industry policy that mandates local production of weapon systems that in the past were procured only from the United States. In part, the policy weens Taiwan away from dependency on the United States for weapon sales that are often influenced by Washington\u2019s fickle relationship with Beijing.\n\nLocal sources also want the PBL to expand later to include Taiwan\u2019s current F-16 upgrade effort. Taiwan procured 150 F-16A/B Block 20 fighters in the 1990s and is currently upgrading them to F-16V as part of the $5 billion Phoenix Rising Program.\n\nThe PBL could later be expanded for the fleet of twenty C-130H Hercules cargo/transport aircraft and twelve P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, all Lockheed Martin products.\n\nThe air force is also upgrading its Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF) under a program that will allow the IDF to carry more munitions and replace its radar and combat computer. Taiwan is down to 126 aircraft from the original 130 due to crashes. It was constructed in the 1990s by state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) in Taichung, which is also participating in the F-16V upgrade program.\n\nAIDC is currently manufacturing a new advanced jet trainer (AJT) to replace its ageing AT-3 and F-5 fighter trainers. The new AJT, expected to roll-out in late 2019, is loosely based on the IDF design. AIDC plans to build sixty-six aircraft with operational deployment in 2026.\n\nThe air force turned its back on pursuing the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) fighter due to a recent Taiwan National Security Council report. It indicated the stealth fighter was too exorbitant and untested in real combat to be a pragmatic choice for Taiwan.\n\nThere are also suspicions in Taiwan that opposition to the sale of a fifth-generation fighter would be raised in Washington over secrecy issues, as mainland Chinese espionage on the island is rampant.\n\nThe STOVL option was originally considered a practical requirement due to China\u2019s vast arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. Military analysts in Taiwan and Washington predict that the air bases will be pummeled during the initial phase of a war.\n\nHowever, Taiwan still needs an advanced fighter aircraft capability to maintain sovereignty and control of its air space, especially as China begins testing the island\u2019s air defense capabilities with fighter and bomber aircraft sorties that now circumnavigate the island.\n\nTaiwan will also retire its ageing Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft due to high maintenance costs and to make room in the budget for new F-16s. Of the sixty fighters France sold Taiwan in the 1990s, fifty-six remain operational. \u201cWe would like to resale the Mirage fighters to a third country,\u201d said one source.\n\nWendell Minnick is an author, commentator, journalist and speaker who has spent two decades covering military and security issues in Asia, including one book on intelligence and over 1,200 articles.

Both UAV types are the outcomes of efforts of a team of .\n\n\u201cNAF\u2019s foray into UAV development commenced in 2008, when its student officers, who were undergoing postgraduate studies in aerospace engineering programmes at Cranfield University, UK, chose UAV development as their research project. The student officers produced the as part of their project and it had neither autopilot nor Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability.\n\n\u201cBy 2013, the NAF developed an experimental UAV, codenamed GULMA, which was then unveiled as the first indigenous UAV. It is noteworthy that Gulma UAV was a technology demonstrator used to gather performance data on UAV systems.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in September 2015, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), , directed the NAF\u2019s R&D Team to build an operational UAV, codenamed Tsaigumi to be used in the Northeast and other theatres of operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe data gathered from the Gulma prototype was subsequently applied in the design of the operational UAV, known as Tsaigumi, and inducted into service on 15 February 2018. Although the Tsaigumi UAV was manufactured at the Air Force Research and Development Centre at NAF Base Kaduna, the Team had to collaborate with an overseas facility to produce the moulds.\n\n\u201cTsaigumi UAV, which is capable of day and night operations, has an operational endurance in excess of 10 hours, a service ceiling of 15,000 feet and a mission radius of 100km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 80kg and its payload comprises an electro-optical infrared camera system as well as weapon hard points. The Tsaigumi UAV, whose engine sound is muffled, has a state of the art encrypted communication system.\n\n\"It has a wingspan of 5.5metres and is able to gather real time weather information. On the contrary, the Gulma UAV has an operational endurance of 4 hours, a service ceiling of 5,000 feet and could not be operated beyond 20km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 40kg and its payload is an electro-optical camera system only. The Gulma UAV, whose engine sound is not muffled, relies on direct radio frequency communication system with attendant limitations.\n\n\u201cThe Gulma has a wingspan of 4.4 metres and relies on Air Traffic Control for weather information. Besides, while the Gulma UAV has an imported autopilot, the operational Tsaigumi UAV has an in-house developed autopilot. Tsaigumi UAV is thus a much more advanced and operationalized version of the earlier produced Amebo and Gulma UAV prototypes,\u201d he announced.\n\nAdesanya said the NAF is currently working on ICHOKU, which when completed, would be the first indigenous Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) in Nigeria."

    "text": "North Korea Concealed National Defense Budget behind People\u2019s Economic Expenses in the 60\u2019s~\u201970\u2019s.\n\nA study was published on the North Korean authorities\u2019 concealment of national defense expenditure.\n\nThe Research Institute of Social Sciences at the University of Ulsan reported a study conducted by Lee Dal Hee a professor of public policy at the university which outlined North Korea\u2019s hidden national defense expenditures. Professor Lee claimed that part of North Korea\u2019s national defense expenses had been concealed behind \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d of the people\u2019s economic expenses.\n\nIt has been doubtful that the North Korea\u2019s national defense expenditures revealed officially didn\u2019t accord with expanded military forces in practice.\n\nThe study analyzed documents such as assembly proceedings by the North Korean People\u2019s Committee in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s and a yearbook of North Korea. The study detected that \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d excluded from the People\u2019s economic expenses were omitted from the official financial budget.\n\nThough there are some difficulties in applying this analysis to the present time taking into account that the analysis was based on documents made 30-40 years ago, this study is significant considering that it may provide a clue to the mishaps of North Korea\u2019s obscure national defense expenditures.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s national expenditure is divided into major departments including the people\u2019s economic expenses, social and cultural expenses, military expenses and administrative expenses.\n\nOn the agenda of the People\u2019s economic expenses is \u201ccommodities and reserved production.\u201d These expenses form part of the commodities and production capital which is used to acquire war materials and materials for national defense. Here, war materials indicate military supplies such as ammunitions and guns, whereas materials for national defense represent items such as oil and food used in the military.\n\nBased on the cost of construction balance from the People\u2019s economic expenditure from 1967~1971, the study analyzes that 30~40% of funds, in fact 5~8 hundred million won had been concealed from the official budget. At the time, 2.16 North Korea won was worth $1 according to an official fixed exchange rate.\n\nThis year, North Korea estimated its national budget to balance at 433.2 trillion won ($30.9bn, $1-141won). Further, North Korea estimated its national defense budget to make up 15.8% of the budget, quoting 68.47 trillion won ($489mn)."

The gathering was meant as a broad examination of new defense cooperation opportunities with a particular focus on joint maritime projects.\n\nA defense spokesman in Berlin said details of the meeting were confidential, noting only that the government was broadly interested in harmonizing defense programs with allies.\n\nThe Netherlands is in the market to replace its four aging Walrus-class submarines by 2027. Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems was tapped last year to build four Type 212 air-independent propulsion boats for Norway and two for Germany, to be delivered in the mid-2020s.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch shipyard Damen, together with Germany\u2019s Blohm & Voss, is in the running for the German Navy\u2019s Mehrzweckkampfschiff 180, a frigate-type surface combatant.\n\nThese three German drones are worth watching With the number of German major weapon programs at a new high, three Bundeswehr drone projects are up for critical milestones in the coming months, the defense ministry told parliament in a new report.\n\nBerlin excluded a competing consortium of TKMS and L\u00fcrssen from that deal weeks ago due to what insiders said where insurmountable differences about the TKMS surface ship division\u2019s approach to that program.\n\nThat move prompted backers of the only purely German-owned industry team to lament the loss of a purely Teutonic contender in the program.

    "text": "The Coast Guard\u2019s long-sought heavy icebreaker, the Polar Security Cutter, was among the programs to receive funding when Congress passed a spending package on late Thursday.\n\nThe Coast Guard is receiving $655 million to start construction on the lead ship for a new class of Polar Security Cutter and is receiving an addition $20 million to purchase long-lead-time materials for a second heavy icebreaker, as part of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations bill, Congressional staffers told USNI News.\n\nLast summer, the Senate had agreed to appropriate $755 million for the Polar Security Cutter. The House of Representatives, though, instead provided DHS with $5 billion to build a wall along the border with Mexico while canceling funding for a variety of programs including the Polar Security Cutter.\n\n\u201cWith the support of the administration and Congress, we plan to build a new fleet of six polar icebreakers \u2013 at least three of which must be heavy icebreakers \u2013 and we need the first new Polar Security Cutter immediately to meet America\u2019s needs in the Arctic,\u201d read a statement from the service provided to USNI News. \u201cThe United States is an Arctic nation with extensive national and global responsibilities. Our role in the Arctic is growing. Diminishing Arctic sea ice is expanding access to the region and attracting attention from both partner and rival states across the globe. Resource extraction, fisheries, tourism and commercial shipping, in conjunction with traditional Alaska native activities, are driving increased maritime activity and a greater need for Coast Guard presence in the region. America\u2019s only heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star, is more than 40 years old and must be replaced by the new Polar Security Cutter.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard has for several years pushed for funding the ice breaker program. Currently, the Coast Guard has only one operational heavy icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10), commissioned in 1976. A second icebreaker, USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11) has not been operational since a 2010 engine failure and instead has for nearly a decade served as a parts donor to keep Polar Star running, USNI News reported in 2017.\n\nFor years, having only one working heavy icebreaker hindered the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to satisfy mission requests from government agencies effectively. The Coast Guard was only able to fulfill 78 percent of heavy icebreaking missions between 2010 and 2016, according to a September 2017 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nHouse Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security member Rep David Price (D-N.C.) told USNI News that the new bill will start to build up what he sees as a critical U.S. capability.\n\n\u201cWith China and Russia showing increased interest in the Arctic region, the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic Strategy is more critical than ever to our national security,\u201d Price said in a statement to USNI News. For years, there has been a significant gap in our nation\u2019s icebreaking capabilities, and I\u2019m pleased the bipartisan FY19 omnibus bill includes funding to finally construct a new Polar Security Cutter, as well as money to begin purchasing long lead time materials for a second. The new Polar Security Cutter will ensure that our national security and economic interests are protected, that our marine vessels are provided safe passage, and that the United States has the ability to counter increased Russian aggression.\u201d"

    "text": "Author: Nicole Jenne, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\n\nIn March 2018, Cambodia and Thailand announced plans for several joint initiatives relating to trans-border movements, including a deal on exchanging fugitives, including exiled political figures. The move comes as both governments show increasingly authoritarian tendencies. But though the deal was hailed by its protagonists as beginning a new era of cooperation, the agreement to hunt down political refugees \u2014 if implemented at all \u2014 will not dramatically change relations between the two countries.\n\nIn the week of 19 March, Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, Tea Banh, travelled to Bangkok to co-chair the 13th meeting of the Cambodian\u2013Thai General Border Committee. Besides meeting his Thai counterpart Prawit Wongsuwon, Banh visited Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha on the latter\u2019s birthday on 21 March. Banh\u2019s meeting with Prayuth attracted considerably more attention than that of the General Border Committee, a two-decade-old dialogue mechanism that has yet to impress with substantial results.\n\nBanh and Prayuth announced a deal to exchange fugitives and \u2018monitor individuals who escape the law by crossing the border\u2019. \u2018Fugitives\u2019 likely refer to exiled members of the political opposition from the respective countries. After the coup in Thailand in 2014, over 100 Thai nationals sought refuge in Cambodia, many to avoid lengthy prison sentences under the country\u2019s harsh lese-majeste law. Thailand, in turn, has hosted at least dozens of Cambodia\u2019s ex-opposition party members since the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved in November 2017.\n\nThe new deal places the exiled opposition from both countries in an even more precarious situation. Only a few days after the agreement was made public, the Phnom Penh Post reported that vehicles from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) had been stationed near the Bangkok homes of ex-CNRP members. Phnom Penh justified the presence of the vehicles by saying that the RCAF only operate in Bangkok in cooperation with Thai authorities to tackle transnational crime.\n\nBut recent trends indicate that crime suppression can serve as a cover for politically motivated charges. Both the regimes in Cambodia and Thailand are increasingly repressive and share an interest in preventing the political opposition from organising abroad. For Prime Minister Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP), this is especially relevant ahead of the country\u2019s general elections in July this year.\n\nA case that set a potential precedent earlier in 2018 involved the extradition of a Cambodian labour activist from Thailand in what was a violation of customary international law. The same international law principles also apply under an extradition agreement signed between the two countries in 2011. Accordingly, forced return is permissible only if the crime for which extradition is sought exists in both countries. Extradition needs to be rejected if there is reason to believe that the request is politically motivated.\n\nIn 2009, it was on these grounds that Cambodia rejected a request by the then Democratic Party government to extradite former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The rejection came just a week after Hun Sen appointed Thaksin as his economic advisor. Under Thaksin, Thailand and Cambodia had forged closer business ties, and Thaksin and Hun Sen developed a close relationship. But after Thaksin\u2019s ouster in the 2006 coup, bilateral relations deteriorated as a result of conflict at the border near the Preah Vihear temple.\n\nWith the regime change in Bangkok in 2014, it is even clearer that reciprocity and political favours weigh more than legal commitments. In the wake of the CPP\u2019s uncomfortably narrow victory in the 2013 elections, Phnom Penh sought international allies and reached out to the newly installed military government in Bangkok. Banh assured Prayuth as early as 2014 that \u2018Cambodia has no policy to allow anyone to use its land to operate against Thailand\u2019.\n\nIn this sense, the agreement in March to exchange fugitives is a formalisation of developments already underway. All the same, the deal is unlikely to bring about substantial changes. Political alliances based on a common enemy are usually of limited duration. In contrast to positive cooperation for a common good, negative cooperation against a threat tends to aim to do the bare minimum. Such joint security measures have limited objectives and are rarely adopted as part of a larger reform package that would induce a qualitative shift in bilateral relations.\n\nThe agreement to exchange fugitives fails to address the range of issues that have led to uneasy relations between Cambodia and Thailand. These include unresolved border disputes, such as the pending implementation of the International Court of Justice\u2019s 2013 ruling on the border near Preah Vihear. Disagreements also cover the growing role of China in Southeast Asia \u2014 particularly in Cambodia \u2014 as well as several transnational issues such as labour migration, smuggling and illegal logging.\n\nIn contrast, the General Border Committee meeting appeared to make some headway in improving cross-border mobility through the creation of several new permanent border gates. If implemented, these measures may facilitate trade and better regulation of illegal crossings. Unlike the authoritarian extradition deal, they could lead to a real improvement in bilateral relations.\n\nNicole Jenne is Assistant Professor at the Institute of Political Science, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

    "text": "A fracas over a telephonic message from the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to Imran Khan on 23 August only added to the already strained relations between the US and its former South Asian ally. Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi contradicted the content of the call. The State Department had said in readout that during the call \u201cPompeo raised the importance of Pakistan taking decisive action against all terrorists operating in Pakistan\u201d. Islamabad refuted the US readout as incorrect, saying that this \u201cissue of terrorism\u201d was not discussed. However, when questioned by a reporter, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there would be no correction in response to Pakistan\u2019s complaint. \u201cI can only say we stand by our readout,\u201d\n\nMike Pompeo\u2019s message was preceded by the visit of Iranian foreign minister Zarif to Islamabad and Imran Khan Government\u2019s outright expression of support to Iranian stand in the face of Trump\u2019s threat to rescind the nuclear deal. Pakistani foreign minister\u2019s mind was also worked about the New Delhi visit of the US high-power delegation likely to take place after about a week of its visit to Islamabad. By raising the controversy Pakistan government wanted to give a message to the people that the US had taken the first initiative for rapprochement in bilateral relations that had begun to nosedive with the famous remark of Trump that \u201cwe gave billions of dollars to Pakistan and in return, they gave us lies and deceit.\u201d Qureshi\u2019s compulsion of distorting the factual message reflects discomfiture caused by Washington\u2019s insistence on \u201cdo more\u201d.\n\nPak Foreign Minister\u2019s attempt to dilute the content of the telephonic talk becomes meaningless when we focus on Pentagon\u2019s overview of Pak-US relations with reference to the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe denial could also be an attempt to dodge the closely guarded commitment that Pakistan army top brass might have made to their counterparts in Washington. What was the army top brass of the two sides talking about all these months? In a statement given at a briefing in the Pentagon the spokesman Mr Faulkner said \u201cSince January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan\u201d. Does Pakistan army now want to make the scapegoat of the civilian government for wriggling out of the broad frame of a formula worked out during these parleys for ending Afghan crisis?\n\nDays before Pompeo delegation\u2019s departure for Pakistan, Defence Secretary James Mattis said in a news briefing at the Pentagon that in their talks with Pakistani officials, the delegation will \u201cmake very clear what we have to do, all of our nations, in meeting our common foe, the terrorists, and make that a primary part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nEvidently, the issue at hand is Afghan war and Pakistan\u2019s hand in fuelling its flames. Noting that repeated warnings to Pakistan to deny safe haven to Afghan Taliban, particularly the Haqqani and Let networks fighting the US-led NATO forces have fallen on flat ears, Trump administration put into practice its three-point agenda of containing global terrorism with epicentre in Af-Pak region as was announced by him in his speech in Saudi Arabia last year. He earmarked three facets of US\u2019 new strategy for South Asia viz. (a) stripping terrorists of their territory (b) cutting off their funding and (c) exposing the false allure of their evil ideology. \u201cTerrorists are nothing but thugs, criminals and predators\u201d, he had concluded.\n\nReferring to Afghanistan and Pakistan in his Camp David speech last year, President Trump had underlined the basics of his strategy as (a) stopping resurgence of safe havens and (b) preventing nuclear weapons and materials being used against us or anywhere in the world. This very emphatically suggests that Trump administration\u2019s main concern is to find a mechanism that would deny the terrorist groups in Af-Pak region access to Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nTrump administration\u2019s indication of discouraging IMF to bail out Pakistan with 9 billion dollar loan from its crumbling financial crisis is in addition to the cancellation of US dollars 300 million aid to Pak army. The loud and clear warning has come on the eve of the visit to Islamabad of a high powered US government delegation. Pakistan foreign minister Qureshi is trying to minimize the adverse impact of the cancellation of a hefty amount of aid by raising flimsy technical issues. However, Lt. Col. Kone Faulkner, the Pentagon spokesman in an email to the AFP made clear why the US had blocked the amount of aid. He said, \u201cDue to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy\u2026 $300m (actually $323.6m to include non-Pakistan funds) was reprogrammed by the Defence Department in the June/July 2018 time frame for selected urgent priorities\u201d.\n\nThis statement touches on the essence of the irritants between the two countries. It found reverberation in the statement of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Joseph F. Dunford, who also had attended the Congressional briefing, that the US had \u201cpermanent interests in South Asia\u201d and wanted to \u201cmaintain a presence (there) to have influence in that region\u201d.\n\nIncidentally, General Dunford\u2019s inclusion in the delegation dispels the impression that this was not a proper visit but just a stopover, as US State and Defence Secretaries were both going to be in New Delhi next week for the first two-plus-two talks between the United States and India.\n\nThe \u201cpermanent interest in the region\u201d to which the American General was referring has to be understood by what President Trump expressed about dismantling of terrorist organizations active in Afghanistan-Pakistan region, and its threat to American interests. President Trump asserted that 9/11 had originated in that very region. A further clarification of the expression of interest is reflected more eloquently in how Trump looks at India in his vision of the new South Asian strategy. He had made a very clear and threadbare statement:\n\n\u201cAnother critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India\u2019s important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region\u201d.\n\nAt the Pentagon meeting Secretary Defence, Mattis said, \u201cWe see the strengthening of India\u2019s democracy, its military, its economy as a stabilising element in the world. And we want to make certain that where we have common interests, we are working together.\u201d\n\nThis is a paradigm shift in US\u2019 South Asia policy. In other words, US acknowledges the significance of India\u2019s role in stabilizing peace in the South Asian region where Afghanistan and Kashmir continue to be the zones of activity of terrorist organizations, particularly those that have been designated by the US or the UN. The first pillar of the new strategy in South Asia enunciated by President Trump and stated above is of \u201cstripping terrorists of their territory\u201d. This means chalking out of a joint strategy with frien0dly countries to deny space to the terrorists presently active in two conflict zones in South Asia. The message is clear and loud for all terrorist networks and their handlers as well as safe haven providers\n\nAs for the second pillar meaning \u201ccutting off their funding\u201d the Trump administration has taken two explicit steps viz. using its clout with IMF to obstruct bailing out Pakistan from financial crunch and cancellation of 300 million US dollar aid, a proposal waiting Congressional determination likely to come before the close of September.\n\nCuriously, Pakistani foreign minister Qureshi has disputed the $33b figure quoted by President Trump, insisting that around half of the money relates to reimbursements. His contention about the cancelled aid is that the payment, which the US is now considering scrapping, is, in fact, the support coalition fund. \u201cThis is not an aid of any kind that can be suspended,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is actually the payment of expenses incurred by us during the war against terrorism.\u201d However, forcefully rebutting Pakistan\u2019s contention, Pentagon spokesperson Faulkner analysed the US stand as this.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, recent reporting has distorted the details of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) by stating several things out of context. The suspension of security assistance to Pakistan was announced in January 2018. The CSF is included in the suspension and it remains in place. This is not a new decision or a new announcement, but an acknowledgement of a July request to reprogram funds before they expire. Reminding Pakistan that since January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan.\n\nHe made it clear that the US \u201ccontinues to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and LeT, and we continue to call on Pakistan to arrest, expel or bring the Taliban leadership to the negotiating table.\u201d Asserting that 2018 DoD Appropriations Act, published on March 23, details $500 million was rescinded by the Congress. He dismissed the Pakistani stand by arguing that owing to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy, the remaining $300 million was reprogrammed by the Department of Defence (DoD) in July 2018 time frame for other urgent priorities before the funds expire on September 30.\n\nIn final analysis the message brought to Islamabad by the US delegation boils down to this: Sever all links with Taliban terrorist groups including Haqqani and LeT networks; become our partner in new South Asian strategy of uprooting terrorism of all hues and in stabilizing peace in the region; ensure that nuclear weapon and material does not fall into the hands of terrorists. In return, we shall restore the process of giving the aid money and develop a sound partnership in bilateral trade and commerce.\n\nEvidently, Pakistan will make a deep study of the repercussions of dropping down the Haqqani and LeT networks as that would amount to the all-time departure from the policy of carving strategic space westward and eastward with focus on Afghanistan and Kashmir. Islamabad will also carefully study the outcome of the US high-level team\u2019s parleys with the Indians next week. Interestingly, New Delhi has done some advance spadework in J&K as a complement to the US\u2019 theorem of stripping terrorists of their territory. Dismissal of the PDP-led coalition government was part of cooperation for counter-terrorism. The continuation of the process will see the revival of the suspended assembly to prop up a government with far less commitment to the spectre of separatism and fundamentalism.\n\nIslamabad will closely watch to what extent the US high power delegation will gravitate to the Indian perception of terror phenomenon in South Asia. In the impending 2 + 2 meets in New Delhi, the status of Sino-Russian forays into South Asia and India-Pacific politics is likely to be the keynote subject for discussion. Remember that the Chinese foreign minister is expected to show up in Islamabad soon after the departure of the visiting US delegation."

    "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly signed off on a Ministry of Industry and Trade proposal to for defense and high-technology holding Rostec to help fund a high-profile civilian airliner project managed by the United Aircraft Company.\n\nAccording to the Kommersant newspaper, citing several unidentified government and industry sources, the 30 billion ruble (U.S. $535 million) investment in United Aircraft\u2019s MS-21 commercial airliner project may pave the way for an eventual takeover of the company \u2014 which is Russia\u2019s second largest defense contractor, and the world\u2019s 14th largest according to the 2017 Defense News Top 100 ranking of global defense enterprises.\n\nPutin reportedly signed off on the proposal by stamping a January 23rd letter from Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov, according to an unidentified Kremlin source cited by Kommersant. In the letter, according to Kommersant, Manturov wrote that Rostec has \u201cconfirmed the possibility of allocating about 30 billion rubles to the MS-21.\u201d\n\nKommersant was unable to secure official confirmation from the Kremlin, and a request for comment from the Industry and Trade Ministry went unanswered. When approached by Defense News for comment, the United Aircraft Corporation declined to comment on the proposal for Rostec financing of the MS-21 project. However, a source from United Aircraft spokesman said that \u201cany aircraft development program such as the MS-21 is investment intensive. And capital investment is better than borrowed investment.\u201d Ultimately, he added, such a decision isn\u2019t even up to Rostec, \u201cas the decisions are made elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRostec has heavy influence in both commercial and defense markets, primarily pulling in Russian tank production. Defense News Executive Editor Jill Aitoro spoke to CEO Sergey Chemezov during IDEX in Abu Dhabi to find out what is ahead for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reported MS-21 financing proposal is seen in Moscow as the first step in a broader play by Rostec to consolidate its control over the Russian defense industry. In 2015, the company\u2019s former president, an experienced aerospace engineer who one lead MiG and Sukhoi named Mikhail Pogosyan, was replaced by former Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Yury Slyusar.\n\nSlyusar is considered to be an ally of Sergey Chemezov, the head of Rostec. Chemezov, himself reported to be an old friend of Putin\u2019s, has presided over the gradual expansion of Rostec\u2019s defense industry holdings over the past decade. Rostec today controls over two-thirds of the Russian defense industry. Acquiring UAC would be a major expansion of its holdings.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cIt is an open secret that Rostec is trying to absorb as much of the industry as they can,\u201d a defense industry source told Defense News on a condition of anonymity. \u201cRostec makes certain moves, and then Manturov supports them. The company is, in effect, a kind of shadow ministry of defense industry production.\u201d\n\nBut UAC\u2019s fate is not yet sealed. According to Kommersant, Rostec itself has reservations. If the company takes control of UAC, it will also find itself responsible for financing the company\u2019s projects beyond the MS-21 airliner. With development of high-end military aircraft going on at Sukhoi, MiG, and even Tupolev, such a burden could end up being substantial.\n\nBut jockeying for control over the company continues behind the scenes, Kommersant reported. In November, the newspaper reported that the Industry and Trade Ministry had already worked out a proposal with the Economic Development and Finance Ministries by which the state\u2019s 91.7 percent ownership of the company would be transferred to Rostec.\n\nThat proposal was blocked by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who\u2019s portfolio includes oversight of the Russian defense and space industries. Rogozin has argued that there is no economic justification for such a transfer. Manturov\u2019s proposal, however, is supported by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Kommersant reported.\n\n\u201cRogozin is lobbying in the other direction,\u201d the defense industry source told Defense News. \u201cHe is pushing for a merger of United Aircraft Corporation with Roscosmos, the state space corporation, in an effort to create a sort of super aerospace company. But Rogozin is much weaker than Manturov and Chemezov, so if Chemezov really wants it, he will ultimately get it.\u201d\n\nDefense chiefs on Trump's list of alleged Putin beneficiaries 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5\n\nIn an effort to sidestep Rogozin, Manturov has reportedly submitted his latest proposal directly to the Kremlin. This plan, which Kommersant reports is expected to be featured on an upcoming draft presidential decree on the matter, features the merger of United Aircraft with Russian Helicopters \u2014 a Rostec holding. Medvedev has reportedly agreed that a merger of the helicopter and aircraft industries make more sense.\n\nWhen approached by Defense News Thursday, a Russian Helicopters spokesperson said the company has no comment at this time. United Aircraft spokesman Syssoev told Defense News that the company\u2019s official position is that \u201cwe are controlled by our shareholders and as such it is up to them to decide on these matters.\u201d"

Sometimes it is referred as the BREM-84. It is similar to modern Western ARVs. Typical tasks of the Atlet include recovery of damaged or overturned armored vehicles on the battlefield. It also provides maintenance service or tows them to maintenance units. The Atlet ARV was officially accepted to service with the Ukrainian Army in 2008. However only one vehicle was built. This armored recovery vehicle is also proposed for export customers. A small number of these ARVs (BREM-T) have been exported to Thailand. Recently some sources reported that Pakistan ordered 12 of these Ukrainian armored recovery vehicles alongside with 294 Oplot-M main battle tanks for delivery in 2018-2021. The Atlet ARV is based on a modified T-80UD main battle tank chassis. It can be also based on the chassis of more recent Ukrainian Oplot main battle tank. It is fitted with a crane, winch and a front-mounted dozer. Crane of this armored recovery vehicle is hydraulically operated and can lift up to 25 t, which is adequate for most missions. The crane is installed on a rotary platform. It is capable of lifting the turret of most main battle tanks. It is also used to lift powerpacks of the MBTs, or for other load-lifting works. If repairs are required to a vehicle's suspension, the crane raises the front of back of the vehicle to allow access to the damaged system. When not required the crane lays along the right side of the hull. The main mechanical winch is provided with 130 m of cable and has a traction force of 25 t. With the help of pulley blocks traction force is increased to 50 and 75 t. The main winch is used for recovery of damaged, stuck, sunken and overturned vehicles. There is also an auxiliary winch with 260 m of cable and a traction force of 900 kg. It is used for delivery of the main winch rope and other cargo handling operations. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle tows damaged, faulty or uncontrolled vehicles, or similar type tanks using rigid or non-rigid hitches. Vehicles are towed to the nearest shelters, assembly points of repair depots. Vehicle has a welding outfit for welding and cutting works in the field. These are carried by one of the crew member. The Atlet also has a set of tools for field repairs. The front-mounted dozer blade is used for clearing obstacles and earth-mowing works, such as preparation of firing positions, covering up of ditches, self-entrenching and so on. Capacity of earth-mowing works in clay terrain is 120 m\u00b3/h. The dozer blade is also used to stabilize the vehicle during craning and winching operations. The Atlet ARV has a required level of protection to operate alongside the frontline units. Front arc withstands small-caliber projectile hits, while all-round protection is against heavy machine gun fire and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle is fitted with NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. This armored recovery vehicle is armed with remotely controlled 12.7 mm machine gun. It is used for self-defense against ground and low-flying air targets. A total of 450 rounds are carried for this machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle has a crew of three, including commander, driver and handler. There is a special cargo platform at the hull rear. It is used to transport spare engine, gearboxes, spare parts, cargo, additional fuel or other equipment with a total weight up to 1.5 t. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle is proposed with two engine options. The basic is a 6TD turbocharged diesel engine, developing 1 000 hp. A more powerful 6TD-2 engine, developing 1 200 hp, is also available. This armored recovery vehicle is also fitted with auxiliary power unit. It ensures operation of the add-on equipment, such as welding equipment, auxiliary winch and other electric equipment of the vehicle, when the main engine is turned off. With a deep wading kit this ARV fords water obstacles up to 5 m deep. When not in use this deep wading kit is stored on top of the roof. The Atlet ARV can be airlifted by the An-124 or similar heavy cargo aircraft. Variants BREM-T is a similar armored recovery vehicle with some minor changes to meet specific Thai Army requirements, such as a different radio, air conditioner and so on. . It was specially developed to meet a Thai Army requirement. It was revealed in 2013. It is based on the Oplot-M chassis and is designed to support these main battle tanks. Thailand ordered a total of 49 Oplot-M tanks and required a dedicated ARV to support them. Can't find what you're looking for?"

    "text": "By Chris Thatcher | February 19, 2019 Chris Thatcher |\n\nEstimated reading time 6 minutes, 12 seconds.\n\nOn Feb. 16, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) accepted the first two of 25 Australian F/A-18A Hornet fighter aircraft at 4 Wing Cold Lake, Alta.\n\nThe federal government is acquiring the 30-year-old jets to fill a capability gap it claims is affecting the RCAF\u2019s ability to simultaneously meet NORAD and NATO obligations. Eighteen of the jets will be brought up to operational standard while seven will be reserved for parts.\n\n\u201cThe interim fighter fleet is key to ensuring the [RCAF] can continue to fulfil their missions and ensure the safety of Canadians and Canada,\u201d said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan in a statement.\n\nThe two aircraft were flown to Cold Lake from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, where they were participating in Exercise Red Flag.\n\nBefore the F-18s can be integrated into the Canadian fleet of CF-188 Hornets, they will undergo several modifications at L-3 MAS in Mirabel, Que., to bring them up to the same operational configuration as the Canadian CF-188 Hornets, including cockpit and communications upgrades, a night vision imaging system, a sniper targeting pod, landing gear modifications, a new ejection seat, and of course the Air Force paint scheme.\n\n\u201cWe will make the necessary investments in these aircraft to ensure they meet the requirements of the [RCAF],\u201d said Carla Qualtrough, Minister for Public Services and Procurement Canada in a statement.\n\nAs part of the reconfiguration, the Australian jets could also see an upgrade to their combat capability. A review by the Air Force is currently underway to assess any necessary improvements to the combat capability of the Canadian Hornet fleet after an Auditor General\u2019s report in November flagged a shortage of pilots and the declining combat capability of the aircraft as the two \u201cbiggest obstacles to meeting the new operational requirement.\u201d The review is expected to be completed by spring 2019.\n\nThe budget to acquire the Australian jets and extend the life of the current fleet of 76 Hornets until a new fighter is procured beginning in the mid 2020s is about $3 billion.\n\nDeliveries of the Australian Hornets will continue at regular intervals for the next three years, with the final aircraft expected by the end of 2021. The jets will be distributed among the tactical fighter squadrons and operational training squadron at 3 Wing Bagotville, Que., and 4 Wing Cold Lake.\n\nThe Liberal government has been criticized for manufacturing the capability gap and unnecessarily acquiring an interim fleet. Patrick Finn, assistant deputy minister for materiel at the Department of National Defence, however, assured a Senate committee in late October that the Australian jets would help the Air Force transition to an eventual replacement fighter.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft will really increase our fleet, and it is not the number of aircraft that counts; it is rather the hours of use in the future,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe are looking for an aircraft that will remain in service for another 14 years. What is needed is enough hours on the structural side. We will be able to use these aircraft until the entire fleet is no longer in service.\u201d\n\nAs the interim capability is introduced, the Air Force is also trying to address the other issue highlighted in the Auditor General\u2019s report\u2013a lack of experienced pilots and maintenance technicians.\n\nMGen Alain Pelletier, chief of the fighter capability project, told an Ottawa conference on defence and security on Feb. 13 that several initiatives were being implemented to retain pilots and technicians.\n\n\u201cGiven that there is a lot of pull out in the commercial marketplace for skilled technicians and pilots, we\u2019re doing our best to retain our folks to actually deliver the capability that is expected of the RCAF,\u201d he said.\n\nIt takes five to seven years to develop a fighter pilot and a frontline technician able to lead a crew at the squadron level, he noted. While new recruitment efforts will help bring more people into the Air Force, they won\u2019t resolve the challenge of having enough experienced people at both the operational squadrons and in the training system.\n\nWithout those experienced people, delivering all the capability outlined in the government\u2019s 2017 defence policy would be a challenge, he said. \u201cWe need the right people with the necessary skills on the squadrons to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t unique to the RCAF. Commodore Steve Waddell, the Royal Canadian Navy\u2019s director general for naval strategic readiness, observed that the military as a whole is competing with the commercial sector for much-needed talent. Most Navy trades, he said, are short about 10 per cent and can be as low as 60 per cent capacity when sailors are on leave, taking professional development courses or otherwise unavailable for active duty.\n\nThe Navy will make greater use of data, artificial intelligence and machine learning to help the workforce \u201cto be more efficient\u201d and reprofile its people to deliver the defence policy, he said."

    "text": "A remote Iranian port could be the next trigger for geopolitical tensions between rivals China and India. India has pledged more than $500 million to develop the strategically located port of Chabahar -- roughly 1,800 kilometers (1,110 miles) from the capital Tehran -- since it first expressed interest in 2003. Yet repeated delays have prompted Iran to turn to China in the hope of speeding up construction.On a March trip to Islamabad , Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he\u2019d welcome Chinese and Pakistani investment in Chabahar, according to Dawn newspaper. He cited China\u2019s development of Gwadar, a port down the coast that is a showcase of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt-and-Road infrastructure initiative.The shift makes sense for Iran, which wants to ensure Chabahar is an economic success. But it could be a strategic loss for India, which opposes China\u2019s expansion in the Indian Ocean and is already worried that Gwadar could one day be used as a military base -- along with other China-backed ports from Myanmar to Bangladesh to Sri Lanka.Any formal investment from Beijing would further weaken the strategic advantage for New Delhi to invest in Chabahar, which is close to Pakistan\u2019s western border. The Gwadar port is part of Xi\u2019s plan to finance $50 billion in infrastructure investments in Pakistan , and Chinese merchants already have a strong foothold in Chabahar.China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"Delhi would likely take the view that any Chinese presence at Chabahar, even if not involved in the operation of the port, could be used as a way of undermining India\u2019s influence with local authorities,\" said David Brewster, a senior research fellow with the Australian National University\u2019s National Security College. \"It could also be potentially used to facilitate surveillance of India\u2019s activities.\"While it\u2019s unclear whether China will take up Iran\u2019s offer, the involvement of a cash-rich and expansionist Beijing would almost certainly speed up development of the port.China has overland train connections linking China to Iran and \u201chuge\u201d investments in the country, said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think-tank. \"China is much deeper there than India.\"Iran\u2019s invitation to invest was welcomed in Pakistan. \"It\u2019s a positive statement that came for the first time from their side,\" Dostain Khan Jamaldini, chairman of the Gwadar Port Authority, said by phone. The two countries are already discussing a new ferry service that would link ports in Gwadar and Karachi with the Iranian ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas, Jamaldini said.Cooperation between the two ports could be awkward. India and Pakistan are historic foes that have fought several wars, while India and China -- which recently faced off in the Himalayas -- are battling for geopolitical influence in South Asia.Still, for Iran the port\u2019s development is important. It will be a vital trading hub in the Gulf of Oman, said Ebrahim Jamili, head of the Iran-India Chamber of Commerce in Tehran.\"The priority is with the Indians -- they\u2019ve been involved and came forward first,\" Jamili said. \"But if another investor comes along and is interested in Chabahar, there is certainly enough space and opportunity for them and for their investment.\"While there\u2019s been talks on Chinese and Pakistani involvement, Jamili said Pakistan is not a serious contender in terms of investment.India first agreed to help Iran expand Chabahar port in 2003, constructing two terminals -- a multipurpose cargo terminal and a container terminal. Progress slowed particularly as Western nations imposed sanctions on Iran, which were lifted in 2015. Delays have persisted since then, including a two-year dispute over whether India would pay $30 million of excise duties on port equipment imported into Iran.Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Monday construction was going well and both sides were meeting regularly. He was unable to give a completion date.\"Significant progress\" has been made at Chabahar, Kumar said, noting it was Iran\u2019s \"prerogative\" to choose its partners.Cooperation with China would help Iran to relieve its financial situation and promote infrastructure development, said Yang Guang, a researcher on international relations with state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\"China and Iran, as increasingly important economic forces on the international stage, have great potential for cooperation,\u201d Yang said."

Allies routinely conduct maritime surveillance from an Icelandic base, where NATO tracks Russian military movements in the north Atlantic and Arctic.\n\n\u201cYour strategic location in the Atlantic helps to bind North America and Europe together,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe Arctic has emerged as a high-profile security issue for the U.S. and NATO. The concerns stem from melting ice that will eventually open long-closed sea lanes, and a Russian military buildup in the region that could exploit the situation. China also is looking to gain a foothold in the Arctic in what U.S. European Command officials have called an \u201ceconomic charm offensive.\u201d\n\nAdm. James Foggo, head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, said last month that the Arctic \u201cpresents a new challenge for freedom of the seas.\u201d\n\nRussian forces have reoccupied seven former Soviet bases in the Arctic Circle and built other new bases in the region, Foggo said.\n\n\u201cThey have renewed their capabilities in the North Atlantic and are aggressively extending their reach in the Arctic,\u201d Foggo said in a command podcast. \u201cThe improved capability of Russia to project power into this region, from the Northern Sea Route to the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap, is something that we must pay particular attention to.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Iceland, its strategic location has been important for NATO dating back to the Cold War, when U.S. troops were based there. The country also played a large role in hosting allied forces in 2018 when NATO held one of its largest exercises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, despite majority support for membership in Iceland\u2019s parliament, the country\u2019s left-wing prime minister has staked out a rare position as a NATO head of state opposed to alliance membership.\n\n\u201cMy personal position is that we should leave NATO, so I am critical towards any increased militarization of the North Atlantic, but our government will stick to the security policy that we have agreed upon and a part of that policy is our membership of NATO,\u201d Jakobsdottir said in November, as quoted by Arctic Today.\n\nOn Tuesday, she did not address the issue of NATO membership, but said security in the Arctic is in everyone\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cFirstly, we talked about the Arctic, and I think we share concerns,\u201d Jakobsdottir said. \u201cThe Arctic should stay a low-tension zone.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg said institutions like NATO play a role in maintaining order in \u201cuncertain and unpredictable times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to try to continue to work to maintain low tensions in the High North despite the fact that we see more military presence, especially of Russian capabilities, up here,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92019 the Stars and Stripes\n\nVisit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."

    "text": "Armenia - Military Spending\n\nArmenia's 2015 defense budget is equivalent to only about $500 million. Despite this huge spending disparity, the country has so far been able to largely maintain the military balance with its oil-rich foe. Through bilateral defense agreements with Russia and membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), it has long been receiving Russia weapons at knock-down prices or free of charge. This mostly unpublicized military aid appears to have intensified in recent years.\n\nIn particular, Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian-backed army is known to have formed a new tank brigade (which typically consists of around 100 tanks) and received more heavy artillery in 2012. In late 2013, it announced the provision of another 33 Russian-made tanks to its forces. Russia also reportedly delivered 110 armored vehicles and 50 rocket systems to the Armenian military during that period.\n\nArmenia will soon buy more advanced weaponry at domestic Russian prices with a $200 million low-interest loan that was disbursed by Moscow during the \"Electric Yerevan\" protests. Around the same time, the Russian government revealed that it is negotiating with the Armenian side on supplying the latter with state-of-the-art Iskander-M missiles that would significantly boost Armenia's ability to strike Azerbaijan's vital oil and gas installations. The Armenian missile arsenal currently includes Soviet-era Scud-B and Tochka-U systems with firing ranges of 300 and 120 kilometers respectively.\n\nThe military budget was estimated in 1992 at US$33.8 million. Conscripts generally lacked equipment and advanced training, and some units were segregated by social class. Officer elitism and isolation are also problems, chiefly because the first language of many officers is Russian. Desertion rates in 1992\u009793 were extremely high. In early 1994, the defense establishment considered formalizing the status of the large number of volunteers in the army by introducing a contract service system.\n\nThe Karabakh Self-Defense Army consists mostly of Armenians from Karabakh or elsewhere in Azerbaijan, plus some volunteers from Armenia and mercenaries who formerly were Soviet officers. The Karabakh forces reportedly are well armed with Kalashnikov rifles, armor, and heavy artillery, a high percentage of which was captured from Azerbaijani forces or obtained from Soviet occupation troops. Significant arms and materiel support also came from Armenia, often at the expense of the regular army. By 1994 the Karabakh SelfDefense Army was building an infrastructure of barracks, training centers, and repair depots. Defeats that Armenians inflicted on Azerbaijan in 1993 were attributed by experts largely to the self-defense forces, although regular Armenian forces also were involved.\n\nThe war drained Armenia\u0092s economy, and Karabakh politicians and issues seem to dominate in Yerevan\u0092s policy. Lack of investment, increasing military expenses, and population decreases affect the country\u0092s economy. According to Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan, Armenia\u0092s defense expenditures ($77.5mil. \u0096 4% of GDP) were increasing at a rate corresponding to the increase of Azerbaijan\u0092s military budget ($114mil. - 2.6% of GDP). Armenia's defense budget was $65 million for 2001; the gross domestic product in 2000 was $1.9 billion.\n\nIn the official state budget, national defense, national security and law enforcement spending in 2004 was 74.7 bln dram (USD 150 million), or 23.6 percent of the budget. Spending on the social sector, (health care education and culture) was 111.7 billion AMD (USD 220 million) or 35.5 percent of the budget. There was debate in Parliament this year after the Minister of Defense objected that defense spending was less than spending on education for the first time. The Ministry of Defense also typically benefits from supplemental spending bills throughout the year as well as off-budget expenditures. A published government decree from June 2004, approved by the Prime Minister and the President, has established a joint stock company with the assets of the bankrupt Armenian Airlines and assigned 100 percent of the shares to the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry now owns Armenian Airlines' old assets: 25 old Aeroflot planes, mostly old Tupolev passenger aircraft, and it was not clear if any deal will be made with the airline's creditors. The government used a similar decree on August 18, 2004 to distribute revenues from Zangezour Copper Molybdenum Plant, Armenia's single most profitable asset to the \"Motherland Military Patriotic Fund.\" The Zangezour Copper Molybdenum Plant is one of Armenia's most valuable assets yet to privatized and one of the few state assets to make a profit. The copper mine was offered in a public tender early in 2004 that attracted USD 132 million bids from an American firm and a German firm. The Ministry of Trade had drawn out the sale and made the deal less likely, not least by insisting on selling both bidders 50 percent of the shares rather than awarding the tender to one bidder.\n\nBoth these cases illustrate a systematic policy of making off-budget transfers to the Ministry of Defense and foundations that it controls. In addition to avoiding the scrutiny of the National Assembly and international observers over military spending, such a mechanism doubtless facilitates opportunities for graft among high-level officials. The government's assignment of Zangezour,s profits suggests that the sale itself, equal to one-fifth of the official state budget, may also be kept off-budget. Indeed, there had been no discussion of how the GOAM intends to spend the USD 132 million in cash it expects to receive from the deal.\n\nThe primary responsibility for auditing the GOAM's military spending lies with the Ministry of Defense's internal auditing mechanism, the Department of Financial Inspection. The Defense Ministry's Department of Financial Inspection conducts internal audits and reports to the Minister of Defense. The framework for the internal auditors is decided annually upon receipt of the Ministry's budget allotment.\n\nSeveral mechanisms exist for significant off-budget spending for defense purposes, including the transfer of state revenues to foundations and the direct sale of state assets. The Ministry of Defense reportedly uses these assets to provide for the defense of Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia claims it does not provide for the defense of the self-proclaimed \"Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh,\" in fact it is common knowledge that it does. Funds for this purpose are not accounted for in public documents and are therefore not subject to independent oversight. Because there is no effective independent oversight of these expenditures, it is widely suspected that senior Ministry of Defense officials take advantage of these off-budget funds for personal use.\n\nUntil 2006, the MOD had pushed hard to use FMF funding to outfit all of its ground troops with Harris radios - the continuation of an FY04 FMF purchase of USD 10 million in radios. Over the course of a series of bilateral meetings with the MOD, the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) was able not only to expand FY07 FMF purchases to materiel beyond communications equipment, but to convince the Armenians to use the money to outfit the two units that work closely with U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Kosovo: the 12th Peacekeeping Battalion and the Humanitarian De-Mining Unit.\n\nThe new equipment, which includes uniforms, field equipment and mission-specific equipment for Peacekeeping Battalion platoons, and De-Mining engineer personnel will improve those units' interoperability with U.S., coalition and NATO forces. In obtaining the new equipment, Armenia also will achieve one of the goals listed in its NATO Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP): IPAP 2.3.1; \"create peacekeeping battalion.\" The funding also will provide technical training for the Peacekeeping Battalion's staff, and several of its platoons, and will establish a transition course for new recruits.\n\nOn November 11, the National Assembly approved the 2006 budget which includes a 22 percent increase in public spending funded by continued economic growth, improved tax collection and international donor support. The 2006 budget calls for AMD 482.2 billion (USD 1.15 billion at the projected exchange rate of AMD 420 to the dollar or USD 1.04 billion at the current exchange rate of AMD 463 to the dollar) in expenditures and AMD 412.4 billion (USD 980 million at the projected AMD 420 to the dollar exchange rate) in revenues with a projected deficit of AMD 69.8 billion (USD 166 million at the project exchange rate of AMD 420 to the dollar). The budget emphasizes social spending and there are large increases in expenditures on education and transportation.\n\nIn marked contrast to 2005, there was little debate about the modest increase in official defense spending which is slated to reach AMD 74.1 billion (USD 176 million) in 2006. In previous years this issue had been hotly debated because the Ministry of Defense controls a number of important income generating companies and continues to benefit from significant off-budget revenues. The continuing reliance on off-budget mechanisms to finance military spending keeps the defense portion of the GOAM budget artificially low.\n\nFMF assistance will enable the MOD to increase its peacekeeping and stability platoon contributions to company size units by early 2008. The Armenian MOD is very interested in using FMF and IMET to fully equip the peacekeeping battalion ahead of schedule in 2007, and then to begin to train and equip a second peacekeeping battalion and a brigade staff as a move towards their envisioned peacekeeping brigade. Additional US funding would rapidly enable the MOD to achieve its IPAP goal of turning the peacekeeping battalion into a full brigade, and to increase its peacekeeping and stability platoon contributions to battalions, with an eye toward sending them to Iraq or possibly Afghanistan by 2009. On 01 November 2011, parliament increased Armenia\u0092s 2012 military budget to 150 billion drams (about $400 million) -- the country\u0092s largest annual defense outlay ever. But how the ministry will spend those additional funds is anybody\u0092s guess. Defense spending has long been considered off limits to public scrutiny. Energy-rich Azerbaijan\u0092s military budget stood at a massive $1.76 billion (over 1.38 billion manats) for 2012.\n\nOn 19 November 2014 Azeri Finance Minister Samir Sharifov said, \u0093Azerbaijan\u0092s armed forces need better equipment as Armenia continues its occupation policy in defiance of international law\u0094 and announced that in 2015 Azerbaijan\u0092s defense budget would increase 27 percent to $4.8 billion, 17.9 per cent of the government\u0092s budget expenditures, exceeding Armenia\u0092s total state budget of $3.2 billion. Azerbaijan\u0092s 2014 military budget was $3.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2013 and $3 billion in 2012. In comparison, Armenia\u0092s 2013 defense budget was $447 million.\n\n\n\n"

In February 2017 it emerged that Nigeria had ordered two FPB 110 Mk II coastal patrol vessels. They are 35 metres long and have a maximum speed of 30 knots. They will be fitted with two 12.7 mm machineguns and a 20 mm cannon and a 4.7 metre long Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The weapons will be added in Nigeria. Other equipment includes two Furuno radars and a Vigy Observer electro-optical system.\n\nNigeria\u2019s FPB 110s are based on the models produced for Kuwait, but are driven by propellers and not water jets. They are apparently also more comfortable for the crew, with improved accommodation. The two vessels can accommodate 17 people, including a dozen crew members.\n\nThe boats are powered by two MTU 16V2000 diesel engines giving a top speed of 30 knots and a range of 900 miles with 3-5 day endurance.\n\nOnce delivered, they will be used to improve maritime security off Nigeria, with an emphasis on piracy and maritime crime.\n\nOcea has delivered a number of other vessels to Nigeria, including three 24 metre long FPB 72s in 2012 and a 32 metre FPB 98 Mk II in 2013. Five FPB 72s have been ordered, with two, the Gongola and Calabar, delivered to Nigeria in January this year after the Shiroro and Ose arrived in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother FPB 72 is expected to be delivered to Nigeria in mid-2018."

    "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."

    "text": "As the new United Nations General Assembly opens, the world should rapidly turn its attention to the Sea of Azov. The Sea of where? Azov may be little known, but this sizeable north-eastern offshoot of the Black Sea \u2013 encircled by Russia, occupied Crimea, and Ukraine \u2013 could soon be the new frontline in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Sea of Azov plays host to the key Donbas ports of Mariupol and Berdiansk. Mariupol itself is indeed known across the world: Russian-backed forces seized it in bitter fighting in 2014, but later relinquished it. Mariupol has since become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. But Russia is now increasingly militarising the Sea of Azov in a series of moves that could have implications not only for maritime trade and supplies into Ukraine, but also for the ongoing land war in eastern Ukraine. The UN may soon need to take steps to stabilise the region.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nRussia began asserting itself in Azov in 2015 when it began the construction of a long-anticipated bridge across the Kerch Strait. The bridge stretches from Russia to sovereign Ukrainian territory (eastern Crimea), helping yet more arms, men, and equipment move into Crimea. But Russia also designed the bridge in such a way as to reduce the flow of north-south shipping into and out of Mariupol and Berdiansk. The Kerch bridge is just 33 metres in height, making it impossible for larger ships to pass fully loaded. The strait itself is narrow; even before this, vessels would often have to wait before proceeding through.\n\nThings began moving rapidly over the summer and early autumn. In May, Russian vessels in the Sea of Azov began stopping and delaying shipping, including both Ukrainian vessels and those with flags of third party states, imposing huge waiting costs on all vessels on their way to or from Ukrainian ports. On 17 September Ukraine decided to abrogate the general \u2018Friendship Treaty\u2019 that it signed with Russia in 1997. But this also leaves it potentially more exposed: the Friendship Treaty contained a promise for both sides to respect each other\u2019s borders and territorial integrity \u2013 even if Russia has since broken this promise.\n\nThis is an increasingly volatile situation that could spark a new front in the war between Russia and Ukraine. At the end of August, Ukraine announced the \u201ctransfer of additional forces of the Marine Corps and coastal artillery\u201d to Azov. In total, Ukraine has sent 270 special forces personnel to the Azov and Black Seas. There is also talk of a possible new Ukrainian naval base in the region. On 23 September, Ukraine caught Russia, for once, unawares, and sailed two navy vessels through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov \u2013 a tugboat and the search-and-rescue ship Donbas \u2013 which then headed for Mariupol.\n\nThe status of the sea is subject to several agreements and live legal claims. In 2003 Ukraine and Russia decided to treat Azov as the \u201chistorical internal waters\u201d of both Ukraine and Russia, and to leave the waters undemarcated. Some Ukrainian nationalists are now calling for Ukraine to repudiate the 2003 agreement and make a claim over Azov coastal waters of 12 nautical miles under international maritime law. But this might cede the majority of the sea to Russia and leave Ukraine without access through the strait, as it is unlikely to be unable to enforce a 12-mile claim off Crimea. Ukraine also launched a general UNCLOS case (the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) against Russia in 2016, that claims that Russia has interfered with Ukraine\u2019s \u201crights as the coastal state in maritime zones adjacent to Crimea in the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, and Kerch Strait\u201d.\n\nThe 2003 agreement provides a right to conduct random inspections, but that was never supposed to lead to a general inspection regime, or be the preserve of one country only. Moreover, vessels sailing to or from Russian ports or Rostov-on-Don do not find themselves stopped. Time delays impose considerable financial costs. Turkish vessels are suffering particularly, but Romanian and Bulgarian and many other EU-flagged ships are also experiencing long and costly delays. Russia\u2019s aim is to put off international business in the longer term.\n\nThere is a political backdrop to this too: Petro Poroshenko is standing for re-election in March 2019 on a national security platform, and is taking a tougher line on Azov. Losing Mariupol to Russia again would be a severe blow to Ukrainian morale, at a time when populist opposition candidates, with media support from Russia, are backing a message of \u2018peace\u2019 and \u2018compromise\u2019 in the 2019 elections, including the later parliamentary elections in October.\n\nFrom sea to land\n\nWhat happens here matters for what happens inside Ukraine. Mariupol is the key to maintaining the imports and exports that serve the heavy industry on both sides of the fighting line in Donbas. Remaining economic connections across the frontline would weaken severely. Mariupol may lose viability as a result of these Russian actions, from the impact of the new bridge to Russia\u2019s ramped-up naval activity.\n\nThe Russian maritime threat will force Ukrainian forces to be more cautious about committing soldiers to the current frontline\n\nRussia has redeployed several ships from the Caspian Sea to the Azov Sea (via the Volga and the Don and the canal that links the two), including the corvettes the Grad Sviyazhsk and Velikiy Ustyug. The military threats are many: Russian ships could bombard Ukrainian positions from offshore; they could use long-range Kalibr missiles to strike more or less anywhere within Ukraine; either an amphibious landing or the recent expansion of Russian air-drop facilities could insert troops near or behind the current frontline. It is further possible that Russia may be treating this new operation as a dry run for blockading Ukraine\u2019s other ports, west of Crimea. Most of Ukraine\u2019s exports leave by sea, so a Russian escalation of this approach would be greatly damaging to Ukraine\u2019s economy.\n\nThe most dramatic scenario would be an outflanking operation that surrounded the Ukrainian army in east Ukraine by landing behind it to the west. Ukrainian troops are dug in. Parts of the front are mobile, but some parts resemble the defensive positions of the Western Front in the first world war. The Russian maritime threat will force Ukrainian forces to diversify and be more cautious about committing soldiers and resources to the current frontline. At the very least, Russia is using the Azov operation to pressure Ukraine to loosen its blockade of Crimea, and resume water supplies, but also to promote disillusion and fatigue with a war that is now more than four years old.\n\nEnter the UN?\n\nActions on the ground appear to have rendered the 2003 agreement effectively obsolete, but diplomatic protest from the West so far has been minimal, despite the serious nature and strategic intent behind Russia\u2019s Azov operation and the increasing number of ships with Western flags affected by it. The rapid deployment of a UN Maritime Peacekeeping Operation mission would defuse the situation and maintain the freedom of maritime movement in the region, and help to avert any further escalation.\n\nAs well as ensuring freedom of movement, the mission\u2019s tasks should include monitoring. It should also provide escorts for Ukrainian and other vessels, as well as receive the power to intercept and inspect vessels and to organise incident resolution meetings. A neutral third country with maritime capabilities, such as India, could lead the mission.\n\nSuch a mission would require invitations from Ukraine and Russia. Russia may wield its Security Council veto, but it actually has a long-term interest in reducing tensions, given the expensive infrastructure it is building in the region. Turkey would also be key to any passage of ships through the Bosporus. Discussions about a peacekeeping mission on land for Donbas are currently stuck; a maritime operation would help restart the conversation and bring the UN back into the picture."

    "text": "G\u00d6TTINGEN \u2014 The German armed forces plan to lease advanced Israeli UAVs, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, she pointed out that the inspector general of the Bundeswehr has decided to rent the drone Heron TP, manufactured by the Israeli company IAI, to protect German soldiers in deployments overseas. The German Army already uses the smaller predecessor drone Heron 1 for years in Afghanistan with good results.\n\nAccording to the minister, the leasing contract is intended to bridge the period until 2025 when a new European combat drone will enter service. Last year, Germany, France, Italy and Spain agreed to build such an UAV. In this project Germany wants to take the lead role.\n\nThe lease of three to five Heron TPs will cost roughly \u20ac600 million (US $650 million), with the deployment's start scheduled for 2018, government sources disclosed. The contract is to be concluded by the end of this year. Apparently, the UAVs are to be stationed initially in Israel for training purposes, but a relocation to an air base in northern Germany is planned in the long run. However, in case of problems with the registration, a deployment in Israel seems to be possible.\n\nHeron TP is considered a MALE drone (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) for reconnaissance tasks and can be armed when needed, which is not possible for Heron 1. The partner for the Bundeswehr is primarily Airbus Defence and Space, the company operates and maintains the aircraft. With the Israeli manufacturer IAI, Airbus has completed a so-called teaming agreement without establishing a new company.\n\nAccording to sources in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, a major reason for the Heron TP's selection was Israelis' willingness to give Germany a deep insight into the drone's technology . \"All the technical information we might need, was promised to us\", said a well-informed person linked to the Social Democrats of the Bundestag. According to the source, the Israelis also assured that the know-how could be used for the development of a European drone. IAI sees the Bundeswehr as an important reference customer for Heron TP drone, and the state of Israel is backing the deal, the person said. So far this UAV is only in use by the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAnother argument for Heron TP is its significantly faster availability in comparison to a procurement of US model Predator, insiders said. The technical resemblance of Heron 1 and Heron TP should also facilitate the training of operating personnel.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nNevertheless, with the selection of the Israeli aircraft the Bundeswehr goes a special path, as British, French, Italians, Dutch and Spanish opted for US drones produced by General Atomics. In case of problems with logistics, maintenance or operations Germany can't tap resources of European partners.\n\nAccording to media reports, it is currently being discussed to arm the Heron TP with the air-to-ground missile Brimstone from European manufacturer MBDA, which was confirmed by well-informed sources. Britain has used the weapon already in Libya and Iraq. The German Air Force checks apparently procurement of this missile for its Typhoon Eurofighters. However, IAI should have a say in the selection, as the Israelis would have to disclose their interface for the integration of weapons. Brimstone is manufactured by MBDA UK.\n\nAs of November, the Heron 1 UAVs had logged more than 25,000 flight hours in Afghanistan, Airbus announced. In its contracts, the Bundeswehr acquired a guaranteed number of flying hours of this aircraft type from Airbus. In addition to the maintenance, staff from Airbus is responsible even for takeoffs and landings of the Heron 1. A contract for Heron TP could look similar."

    "text": "Author: David H Shinn, George Washington University\n\nDoes China\u2019s growing engagement with Africa represent the replacement of Western influence with a new economic hegemon? Or does China\u2019s influence continue to face huge challenges and is it significantly overstated? The truth is somewhere in between. China has become a major player but much of the commentary about its relationship with Africa is overwrought. While China\u2019s tactics and perhaps even strategy are novel, it is just another major power pursuing its own interests \u2014 much as the United States, France and the United Kingdom are doing.\n\nThe principal non-African actors on the continent want essentially the same thing from the 54 diverse African countries. They all want access to Africa\u2019s oil, minerals and natural resources. They seek maximum political support from African countries in international forums such as the UN General Assembly and World Trade Organization. They want to increase their exports of goods and services to Africa for the purpose of earning foreign exchange. They are anxious to avoid various negative impacts on their interests and nationals, such as terrorist attacks, piracy, narcotics trafficking and international crime.\n\nEach major power may also have one or two unique interests. China seeks diplomatic recognition from two hold outs \u2014 Burkina Faso and Swaziland \u2014 who still recognise Taiwan. The United States depends on access to ports and airports for its military aircrafts and ships. France wants to maintain its cultural and language connections. The United Kingdom takes pride in the 19 African members of its Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nIt is indisputable that China has joined the big leagues in Africa. China has been Africa\u2019s largest trading partner since 2009. It accounts for about 15 per cent of Africa\u2019s trade, though Africa accounts for only about 4 per cent of China\u2019s trade. China is the largest bilateral financier of infrastructure projects in Africa, averaging about US$11.5 billion in infrastructure investment annually over 2012\u201316.\n\nIn recent years, China\u2019s OECD-equivalent aid to Africa has averaged about US$2.5 billion, compared with about US$8 billion from the United States and US$23 billion from the European Union. China\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Africa are estimated to be about US$3 billion annually. This is roughly the same amount flowing from US companies but well below the US$35 billion invested in 2015 by companies in the European Union. China accounts for only about 5 per cent of Africa\u2019s global FDI stock.\n\nIn 2017, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti, where France, the United States, Japan and Italy also have bases. China contributes more personnel to UN peacekeeping operations in Africa \u2014 almost 2,100 \u2014 than any other permanent member of the UN Security Council. China is also the second-largest supplier of major weapons to Africa after Russia.\n\nChina\u2019s growing security links to Africa are driven by the increasing numbers of its nationals \u2014 upwards of 1 million \u2014 who live or work in Africa. But these nationals are subject to attack just like the nationals and interests of many other countries. Overall, both the United States and France are more militarily engaged in Africa than is China. Since 2008, China has contributed two frigates and a supply ship to anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden \u2014 but so have many other countries.\n\nOne important but little-understood link is the cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and African ruling parties. There are frequent exchanges of delegations going both directions. The CCP provides cadre training and occasionally material support for African parties. Its relationship with the ruling parties in South Africa and Ethiopia is particularly strong. US political parties have no similar relationship, and even most European political parties collaborate far less with African parties than does the CCP.\n\nThe biggest difference between Western countries\u2019 and China\u2019s approach to Africa concerns liberal democracy and human rights. The West attaches importance to these concepts and even puts conditions revolving around them on its assistance to certain African countries. China eschews this practice and emphasises that it does not attach political conditions to its aid (except for insistence on the \u2018One China\u2019 principle). China\u2019s approach is welcomed almost unanimously by African governments \u2014 especially the more authoritarian ones \u2014 but is not appreciated by many African civil society organisations.\n\nThe divergent political ideologies represented by China and the West complicate their ability to cooperate in Africa. Going forward, China\u2019s regime may pose an additional challenge for the expansion of ties in Africa, particularly with the more democratic African governments. A case in point is press freedom. In 2018, China ranked lower than every country in Africa, except Eritrea, in the Reporters without Borders\u2019 press freedom index (the index ranked 180 countries, including 53 in Africa). At some point, increasing numbers of African governments may start asking themselves what kind of democracy is best for them: China\u2019s or the West\u2019s.\n\nDavid H Shinn is an Adjunct Professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University."

    "text": "VERSAILLES, France \u2015 France is to double its order for the Light VBMR reconnaissance vehicle, a key element in the French Army\u2019s \u20ac10 billion (U.S. $12 billion) Scorpion modernization program.\n\nAn additional 420 Light VBMR units are to be ordered, taking the total to 978, according to Erwan, the director of the Scorpion modernization program at Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement procurement office. Erwan, whose last name is not used for security reasons, spoke to the press May 16.\n\nA first delivery of the Light VBMR is due in 2022, with 489 shipped by 2025.\n\nIn addition to the highly equipped 489, there will be a further 200 units ordered, with the latter more lightly equipped units, according to the annex of the draft multiyear military budget law for 2019-2025.\n\nThat raises the total of Light VBMRs to 689 delivered by 2025.\n\nAfter 2025 and out to 2032, there will be a further 978 ordered for Scorpion, and 1,060 ordered outside of the program, with a total of 2,038 for that period.\n\nA first delivery of an armored personnel carrier version of Light VBMR is due in 2021, a reconnaissance model in 2022 and a communications variant in 2023.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nA wide spectrum of missions will be covered, as there will be 16 versions of the vehicle, with 10 of the APC, two for recon and four for comms.\n\nNexter will design, build and service the vehicles, while Texelis will supply the chassis and driveline.\n\nNexter\u2019s factory at Roanne, central France, will build the Light VBMR, adding to the workload generated by orders for the Griffon troop carrier and the Jaguar combat and reconnaissance vehicle.\n\nThe Light VBMR weighs 15-17 tons, can reach a speed of 100 kph and has a range of 600 kilometers. That weight compares to the French Army\u2019s initial requirement for a 10-ton vehicle, before industry called that unrealistic.\n\nOne of the vehicles can be airlifted on a C-130, while two can fit on the A400M transport aircraft. Regarding the latter, the vehicles can be fully equipped for combat and still be successfully loaded.\n\nThe vehicle is armed with a remote controlled 7.62mm machine gun, a minigun at the rear and self-protection with a Galix smoke dispenser.\n\nThe vehicle can carry 10 people \u2015 eight troops, a driver and a gunner.\n\nFrance is also to order an upgrade for 200 Leclerc main battle tanks, with a first delivery of a modernized tank in 2021, Erwan said. Sensors and the Bull SICS battle management system, or Scorpion Information Communication System, will bring the tank into the Scorpion\u2019s so-called collaborative combat concept, which seeks to heighten teamwork on the ground and with commanders at the regimental level.\n\nAn order for the Griffon multipurpose troop carrier is to be raised to \u201da target\u201c of 1,872, up 150 units from a previous total, Erwan said. A first delivery is due by the end of the year, with certification in the second quarter of 2019. Some 936 units are due by 2025.\n\nContracts for those increased orders are expected to be signed later this year after the French Parliament formally adopts the draft military budget law, expected in July.\n\nThat boost in orders follows the Army\u2019s call for a speedy introduction of the new armored vehicles, to replace an aging fleet of VAB troop carriers. There is a 2,700-strong fleet of VABs, which are some 40 years old."

    "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - Just one day after signing a $233 million agreement to sell 16 helicopters to the Philippines, the Canadian government on Wednesday ordered a review of the deal amid concerns the aircraft could be used to fight rebels.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Canada's Minister of international trade Francois-Philippe Champagne speaks during an interview with Reuters in Danang, Vietnam November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nTrade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that the deal - formally signed on Tuesday - had been struck in 2012 on the understanding the helicopters would be used for search-and-rescue missions.\n\nPhilippine Major-General Restituto Padilla, military chief of plans, told Reuters on Tuesday the helicopters would be used for the military\u2019s internal security operations, adding they could also be deployed in search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw that declaration ... we immediately launched a review with the relevant authorities. And we will obviously review the facts and take the right decision,\u201d Champagne told reporters, without giving more details.\n\nThe Bell 412EPI helicopters were due be delivered early next year as the Philippine military prepares to step up operations against Islamist and communist rebels.\n\nPhilippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana initially expressed bemusement at news of Canada reviewing the deal.\n\nHe later issued a statement that the helicopters would primarily be used for the transporting and supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers and for humanitarian assistance and disaster response.\n\n\u201cThey are not attack or close support aircraft,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cWhile they may be used in support of Internal Security Operations ... their role is limited to those that I mentioned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShould the Canadian government choose to discontinue their sale of the aircraft to us, then we will procure them from another source.\u201d\n\nCLEAR REGULATIONS\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, asked later whether he was concerned the helicopters might be used against Filipino citizens, replied \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nCanada has very clear regulations about to whom it can sell weapons and how they can be used, he said during a question and answer event at the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure before this deal or any other deal goes through that we are abiding by the rules ... that Canadian governments have to follow,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte publicly criticized Trudeau at a regional summit in Manila for raising questions about his war on drugs, calling it an \u201cofficial insult\u201d, adding that he \u201cwould not answer to any other bullshit, especially (from) foreigners\u201d.\n\nNearly 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in the campaign since June 2016. Human rights groups accuse police of carrying out illegal killings, staging crime scenes and falsifying reports, a charge they deny.\n\n\u201cHuman rights is a key element of our foreign policy and of our trade policy,\u201d said Champagne.\n\nIn 2016, the Liberal government was criticized for deciding to honor a contract to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite human rights concerns. Like the helicopter contract, the deal had been arranged by Canada\u2019s former Conservative administration.\n\nPhilippine defense ministry spokesman, Arsenio Andolong, said it was \u201cunfair to equate internal security operations in general with human rights violations\u201d or to cast judgment on the military when allegations were unverified.\n\nHe did not specify what the allegations or violations were, or who had made them."

    "text": "Government of Trinidad & Tobago Announces Future Acquisition of Two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats\n\n(Source: Austal; issued July 29, 2018)\n\nAustal Limited (Austal) is pleased to report that the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) has announced its intention to purchase two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats. The vessels will enhance the border protection capabilities of the country in conjunction with the existing Coast Guard fleet, and will join six Austal Fast Patrol Craft acquired in 2009.\n\n\n\nThis announcement is further to a comprehensive proposal submitted by Austal to GORTT in recent weeks. The sale is likely to be supported by the Australian Government via the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), and follows a demonstration by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) of the capabilities of the Cape Class vessel to a delegation of senior Trinidad and Tobago officials, which included the Chief of Defence Staff.\n\n\n\nThe order is likely to be valued at circa AU$100m plus a multi-year ongoing maintenance and support package. Austal expects to establish a Service Centre in Trinidad to support these vessels, the Austal supplied Fast Patrol Craft, and any additional vessels requiring maintenance as determined by GORTT.\n\n\n\nThe new Cape Class vessels will be built in Austal\u2019s Henderson shipyard based in Western Australia. Austal have already built 10 Cape Class vessels in Henderson for the Australian Border Force and RAN. Delivery is expected to be in mid-2020.\n\n\n\nDesigned and built by Austal, the Cape Class is a 58 metre all aluminium monohull patrol boat specifically produced to combat the full range of maritime security threats. The vessel has a long 4000 nautical mile range and 28-day patrol cycle with a crew of up to 22. The vessel also supports two high speed 7.3 metre Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats used for intercepting other vessels.\n\n\n\nGORTT have requested that the purchase be supported by an EFIC finance package which will be developed specifically to support the program, for which EFIC have already supplied a letter of support. The sale of the vessels is conditional on final contracts being signed in the coming weeks, together with a conclusive offer from EFIC to GORTT. It is expected that an initial, lower value design contract will be signed shortly to hasten preparations for the main contract and ensure that the delivery schedule will be maintained.\n\n\n\nThese vessels will be the latest additions to the work already scheduled in the Henderson facility, including a 109 metre catamaran for Molslinjen of Denmark, 21 Pacific Patrol Boats (PPB), currently in build, and a 117 metre trimaran for Fred Olsen S.A. of the Canary Islands which will commence construction in August 2018.\n\n\n\nThese additional build programs will keep the local workforce active at the current level until 2021 (2023 for PPB), one of the longest forward order books seen at Austal for a decade or more.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Russia has maintained its arms exports portfolio despite pressure from external sources, Russian officials have said, and the volume of sales should rise in the future.\n\nSpeaking to Zvezda TV at the ARMY-2019 military exhibition, the head of the Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation, Dmitry Shugayev, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe all know well under which pressure Russia is, especially its defense industry. It is important to stress that our partners are also under very strong pressure and this is an example of unfair competition, as there are attempts to oust us from traditional markets and prevent us from entering new markets.\u201d\n\nRussia has said that its annual arms exports usually amount to around $15 billion. Commenting on the figure, Shugayev added, \u201cNevertheless, we are retaining this level of $15 billion and will be keeping it and increasing it, doing everything possible for that.\u201d\n\nParticularly following alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Washington has sought to tighten the screws on Russia\u2019s defense industry through sanctions, such as the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, as well as diplomatic and political pressure on third-party countries that import Russian arms.\n\nThe most high-profile example of the U.S. pressure campaign is the ongoing spat between Washington and Ankara over the S-400, a Russian surface-to-air missile system that Turkey purchased and expects to begin receiving in July. The U.S. has warned Turkey that the buy will result in economic sanctions and also Turkey\u2019s ejection from the F-35 fighter jet program. Washington is also warning India, another prospective S-400 buyer, against acquiring the system.\n\nBesides pressuring foreign countries, the U.S. is also looking to incentivize the purchase of American-made weapons by offering financial assistance to countries that switch from importing from Russia to importing from the United States.\n\nShugayev emphasized that the measures have not deterred Russia. \u201cThe sanctions have failed to push through the main task of ousting Russia from the world arms market and they have also failed to make our partners turn away from us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Russia \u201cconfidently hold[s] the second place\u201d in weapons sales by countries. Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov said that Russia currently occupies a share of around 20 percent of the world\u2019s arms trade. While that figure can be difficult to verify, the international organization SIPRI recently identified Russia as having a share of about 21 percent, behind only the United States.\n\nAs part of its bid to boost arms sales, Russia is devising a new strategy of military-technical cooperation with foreign partners, Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week. He noted, \u201cWith an eye to ensure the efficiency of our activities in the sphere of military technical cooperation with foreign countries, a draft strategy of military technical cooperation has been elaborated. It envisages coordinated measures of political-and-diplomatic, financial-and-economic and technical nature.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin added that the strategy should account for \u201cnew factors\u201d that create challenges, such as \u201ctougher competition and the aggressive use of unfair methods of political blackmailing and sanctions,\u201d referring to the U.S. efforts to inhibit Russian arms sales."

    "text": "PZL Mielec Signs Agreement with Ecuador Army for M28 Short Takeoff and Landing Aircraft\n\n(Source: PZL Mielec; issued May 15, 2018)\n\nEcuador is the first Latin American country to acquire an M28 aircraft following a two-month demonstration tour of seven Caribbean and Latin America countries in 2017. (PZL Mielec photo)\n\nQUITO, Ecuador --\u2013 Sikorsky/PZL Mielec has signed an agreement with the Ecuador Army for an M28 short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft. Scheduled for delivery later this year from Sikorsky\u2019s PZL Mielec manufacturing facility in Poland, the twin turboprop aircraft will significantly enhance the Army\u2019s multi-role transport capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe M28 aircraft\u2019s unique flight and performance attributes are ideally suited for Ecuador\u2019s diverse climate and terrain,\u201d said Adam Schierholz, Sikorsky regional executive for Latin America. \u201cWe are providing Ecuador a proven platform that will accomplish a wide range of national security missions. With the ability to operate from any type of runway or airstrip inaccessible by other airplanes, and to fly in extreme environmental conditions without decreasing payload, the M28 brings formidable capabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis powerful and tough aircraft has the highest useful load in its class, is easily maintained in the field, and frequently is preferred to larger platforms because of its multi-mission flexibility and cost-effective performance,\u201d said Janusz Zakr\u0119cki, PZL Mielec president and general director, who attended the aircraft signing ceremony held recently in Quito. \u201cWe are very pleased that the Ecuadorian Army has chosen this platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 7,500 kg (16,500 lbs.) M28 airplane can be outfitted with 19 passenger seats, carry up to 2,300 kg (5,000 lbs.) of cargo, and conduct parachuting missions from the cabin\u2019s rear clamshell doors.\n\n\n\nAfter a pilot and mechanic training course in Poland, a PZL crew will fly the aircraft across the North Atlantic Ocean to Shell Mera, Ecuador, via Iceland, Greenland, Canada, the United States and Central America.\n\n\n\nEcuador is the first Latin American country to acquire an M28 aircraft following a two-month demonstration tour of seven Caribbean and Latin America countries in 2017. Flown by two PZL pilots, the touring aircraft demonstrated landings at two remote Ecuador airfields last April \u2014 a 600m (1,968 feet) gravel runway and a 530m (1,738 feet) gravel/grass runway \u2014 with 11 passengers on board.\n\n\n\nSikorsky has received requests for proposals from commercial operators and militaries in Latin America as a result of the tour. A majority of the proposals seek to carry passengers and/or cargo into unprepared landing strips at sea level and high altitude locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "Asia Sentinel ran this piece looking at Burma's military in December 2006. It is sadly even more relevant today Fueled by the sale of energy and timber, a pariah nation seeks weapons to keep its enslaved people in line Locked into a bunker mentality, believing Burma is under siege from insurgents, determined to hold onto power and fueled by profits from looting its forests and fossil fuel energy production, Burma\u2019s junta is buying arms faster than ever. There are plenty of eager sellers even to pariah states if they have the money. In the latest turn of events, General Thura Shwe Mann, Burmese Army chief of staff, is suspected of sealing a deal for Indian military equipment when he visited India\u2019s Eastern Command earlier in December. Indian spokesman, Wing Commander R K Das, would only confirm they discussed joint exercises and training. That trip followed a meeting between Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi, commander of the Indian Air Force and Senior General Than Shwe, head of the military junta, in Naypyidaw, the new capital of Burma, on 22 November. Human Rights Watch claims Mr Tyagi was there to offer light attack helicopters, better avionics for combat jets, and naval surveillance aircraft. On what terms is unclear, but reports say New Delhi is hoping to persuade Rangoon to finally get tough with Indian rebels using Burma as a base to battle for the independence of states in troubled northeastern India. Burma is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries yet it has an army four times larger than that fielded by Britain, the world\u2019s fifth richest country. Shouldering all those rifles and manning armored vehicles are at least 400,000 Burmese troops, double the size of neighboring Thailand\u2019s army. Burma\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, is actively recruiting for a force of 500,000 troops. Indeed given how many soldiers Burma has, the military arguably does not have enough heavy weapons. The Tatmadaw\u2019s modernization follows the footsteps of China, evolving from a peasant army to a heavy conventional force. \u201cAfter decades of being essentially a small, lightly-armed infantry force geared to regime protection and counter-insurgency, the Tatmadaw is gradually becoming an integrated force capable of more conventional, large-scale territorial defense operations,\u201d wrote Andrew Selth, one of a few analysts closely watching the Burmese military, in a research paper. Selth estimates that about 35 percent of the government budget, mostly raised from trade taxes and printing money, goes to the Tatmadaw, or about $240 million in 2005 based on a Central Intelligence Agency government expenditure estimate of $716.6 million. However that is only half the picture because the military trades on its own account through firms such as the Union of Myanmar Economic Corporation and the Myanmar Economic Corporation. \u201cThese function in some ways like the Indonesian military corporates in adding to \u2018defense\u2019 resources. So however it\u2019s measured, Burma\u2019s defense spending will likely always be grossly understated,\u201d says Sean Turnell, a Macquarie University economist studying Burma. Those sums are peanuts compared to what America, Japan or Singapore spend, but go a long way with the low prices offered by the likes of China, Russia and Ukraine. Furthermore, some weapons and supplies are bought through barter arrangements or come as gifts, usually nuts and bolts items like trucks, from China. In addition, as much as one million cubic meters of logs worth an estimated US$250 million are being sold illegally to China, destroying vast and sensitive areas of virgin forest, according to the international watchdog organization Global Witness. The arms purchases suggest a grave external threat. Yet what that might be is hard to fathom. The state-controlled press has in recent years warned of an American invasion, ordering troops, militia and the public to take heart from Iraq and prepare for guerrilla resistance. An American-led attack to topple the junta is nothing but a fevered dream in the imagination of a few dissidents. Given the debacle in Iraq it is even more unthinkable today. Nonetheless, \u201cBurma has been at war ever since independence was granted in 1948, in large part due to the desire of the combatants to control access to (its) natural resources,\u201d according to Global Witness. \u201cSince independence there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths among both combatants and non-combatants. War-related displacement has led to 300,000 refugees, in official camps, in neighboring countries and one million internally displaced people in Burma.\u201d Closer to home relations with neighbors \u2013 Bangladesh, India, China \u2013 are cordial. Relations with Bangkok improved markedly when Thaksin Shinawatra became prime minister of Thailand in 2001. After a rocky start and some border skirmishes, Thaksin focused relations on business. Despite an official withdrawal of support for insurgents and a clampdown on refugees, suspicions remain in Rangoon.\n\n\n\n\u201cGeneral Than Shwe said in meetings that Thailand is our enemy, I don\u2019t know why he thinks like this, he always thinks Thailand supports the insurgency because in the past we support them as a buffer state. But now we change policy, but the Burmese army still thinks about the past,\u201d says a Thai military intelligence source in Bangkok. That is not entirely surprising given heavy smuggling and trade across the porous border, including supplies ordered by remaining insurgents in Mon, Karen and Shan states from Thai merchants. Thailand\u2019s traditionally close cooperation with America also keeps doubts smoldering in Rangoon. Moreover General Surayud Chulanont, installed as Thailand\u2019s prime minister after a coup in September, is no fan of the junta. In addition to the Indians, South Korean firms have been in hot water lately, accused by public prosecutors in Seoul of illegally supplying equipment and helping to build an artillery munitions factory worth $133.8 million in Burma. Cases are now being prepared against 14 executives from seven firms, including Lee Tae-yong, president of Daewoo International. These dealings, though significant, pale compared to previous contracts. Highlights include 1,000 BTR-3U infantry fighting vehicles based on an old Soviet design, which Burma ordered from Ukraine in 2003. Their capabilities are roughly equal to the American Bradleys or British Warriors now on duty in Iraq. Supporting those troop transports are 139 Soviet-designed T-72 main battle tanks, packing a hefty 125mm cannon. Less capable are around 600 Chinese copies of earlier Soviet tanks. These tanks and fighting vehicles are backed up by a few hundred 155mm long-range heavy artillery guns, plus thousands of light guns, mortars, rockets and anti-aircraft missiles. Burma\u2019s navy is also expanding, buying small combat vessels from China to complement ships being built in yards near Rangoon. Electronics and weapons come from the usual scrum of suppliers based in China, Russia, North Korea, India, Israel, and say some reports, Italy. Above those ships and tanks Burma\u2019s air force flies at least a dozen Russian MiG 29s, among the world\u2019s best combat aircraft, along with dozens of older make-do Chinese fighters, plus dozens of simple but tough Polish and Russian multi-purpose helicopters adept at moving troops or attacking with machine guns and rockets. Though Burma\u2019s best kit comes from Russia and Ukraine, its primary supplier remains China. Jared Genser, a visiting fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy, testified to the US-China Economic and Security Review Committee in Washington in August 2006 that China has provided 90 percent of the Burmese military\u2019s equipment in two deals since 1989. \u201cWithout China\u2019s $1.6 billion in military assistance and naval modernization, Burma would not have been able to create the second largest military, behind Vietnam, in Southeast Asia,\u201d said Genser. Burma is also expanding its arms industry. In addition to small warships, arsenals are designing and producing assault rifles and mortars. They are also assembling some of the BTR-3 fighting vehicles from Ukraine. Despite all this weaponry, insurgents are the only active threat facing the regime, a mixture of ethnic nationalists, rebel Burmese, and opium and methamphetamine warlords. But these ragtag armies are far weaker than they were during the 1980s, cut down by attrition, bickering and sweet deals from Rangoon. Burma\u2019s military has forced many to ceasefires or into mountain redoubts using infantry and artillery, rarely risking its expensive attack jets or gunships. With the rebels on the run, friendly neighbors and America bogged down elsewhere has no grave threat. Tomorrow might be rather different. What the generals do fear, of course, is a sudden uprising of the kind that nearly toppled the regime in 1988. Given the isolation and suppression of its people, the generals live in a hostile land with every reason to behave like an occupying army. If they are going to hang on indefinitely to the milking cow they have made of the country, the generals must constantly peer into the future to seek clues for potential missions. One of those will doubtless be securing the infrastructure which will earn large revenues from oil, gas and transportation, some of which will doubtless pay for more combat aircraft, warships and armored vehicles. China\u2019s official media reported in April that preparations were underway for a $2 billion gas pipeline from Sittwe, where offshore oil and gas is brought ashore, to Kunming in Yunnan, which followed an understanding reached between PetroChina and Rangoon in December 2005. That pipeline will run through parts of the Shan State that have in the past been controlled by rebel armies and are still within striking distance of groups pressed up against the Thai border. A parallel oil pipeline is a distinct possibility. China is also negotiating transit rights for trade across Burma via road, rail and river that will run along the same corridor as the pipelines to Andaman Sea ports. Protecting and patrolling this lucrative infrastructure is one mission where fighting vehicles and even tanks could be useful in deterring fading guerrillas and reassuring China. They may also provide security for onshore oil fields, which seem set to expand on the back of exploration wells drilled by Chinese firms. It is a similar story offshore where Burmese, Chinese, Korean and Indian firms are investing heavily in substantial oil and gas fields. Their security, principally against pirates, requires warships and surveillance aircraft, but that alone cannot justify the ongoing naval expansion. All the same these emerging missions to counter low-grade threats fail to justify the junta\u2019s enthusiasm for spending huge sums on military equipment, especially when public health and education are in a woeful state, neglected for decades. \u201cIn practice, the military\u2019s perceived domestic political-security imperative has resulted in a multi-pronged approach to force ethnic insurgents to subscribe to the unitary state in which the military retains a major role. Equally, the imperative has obligated the military to fight off internal and external challenges to its rule and authority,\u201d wrote the London School of Economics\u2019 J\u00fcrgen Haacke, in a study of Burma\u2019s foreign policy earlier this year. America\u2019s push to pressure the regime through the UN does nothing to dispel this paranoia. Moreover, the junta worldview is an antique from another era, in which military strength was a symbol of state prowess, a way to inch Burma up the regional pecking order. A huge military impresses upon the Burmese themselves that protest is futile. They have lowered the guns on their people before, in 1988, and they could do so again with even more devastating effect. \u201cIn Burma they think they need a strong army to control the people. We still believe that who controls the army controls the weapons, controls the people. The poor people still respect the man who has a uniform, who is a soldier,\u201d says the Thai military intelligence source, a veteran of the Thai-Burma border. The chance of a repeat of the 1988 uprising, when thousands were killed by soldiers shipped in to Rangoon for the task, seem remote. Recruiting impressionable young men into the army also helps soak up the unemployed, who might otherwise fall in with the idea of fighting for change. Impressive as this military machine sounds, its effectiveness may not match the image. Morale is low in many units. They often have to farm their own food, or requisition from local villages. Training and discipline are wanting in many units, reports of troops stealing, raping and murdering are commonplace. Maintenance, especially of hi-tech Russian jets or low-quality Chinese equipment, almost certainly presents problems. \u201cI think they lack the logistics and maintenance, they think only about the capability of the weapon, they don\u2019t think about how long they will have it, how to maintain it. If you have a good maintenance and logistics systems then you can fight for a long time, but if you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t,\u201d says the Thai military intelligence source.\n\nSubscribe to this comment's feed Show/Hide comments Show/Hide comment form\n\n"

He sought parliamentary approval to extend the emergency for 30 days on Monday.\n\nChina has drawn criticism in the West for its perceived military buildup of the neighbouring South China Sea, where it has built and expanded islands and reefs.\n\nChina claims most of the sea where neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims."

    "text": "LONDON \u2015 Britain\u2019s defense secretary has put at least a \u00a33 billion-a-year (U.S. $4 billion) price tag on the value of the country\u2019s close military relationship with the US, but conceded that the arrangement was priceless to the government.\n\n\u201cWe benefit massively from our relationship with the U.S. I said you couldn\u2019t actually put a price on it, but when you look at [it] in terms of the benefits we get on a yearly basis I think we would benefit to the tune of a very minimum of \u00a33 billion, and that is taking a very conservative approach,\u201d Gavin Williamson told the parliamentary Defence Committee on Tuesday.\n\nWilliamson said the benefits came in \u201cterms of technology, in terms of joint programs working together. Quite frankly we would always struggle to put that level of investment into a program if we wanted to bring it to fruition, so we are a massive beneficiary of this relationship.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come as the committee concluded an inquiry into British relations with the U.S. and NATO. The findings of the report are expected to be published in the next few months.\n\nThe defense secretary earlier in the day announced the Ministry of Defence had on May 21 hosted a meeting with the U.S. Defense Innovation Board in London aimed at sharing, among other things, innovation priorities.\n\nBritain\u2019s relationship with the U.S. could take a serious hit, however, should media reports from last week prove true \u2015 that London is considering cutting its pledge to buy 138 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets and instead purchase more of the cheaper Eurofighter Typhoons as part of its defense review, officially known as the Defence Modernisation Programme.\n\nOne British newspaper described the possible move as \u201can epic snub\u201d to Washington.\n\nWilliamson also announced Britain\u2019s investment in the creation of what will be called the AI Lab \u2015 a defense center for artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science based at the MoD\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory facility in Porton Down, southwest England.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith the cash-strapped MoD expected to publish the defense review ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels scheduled for July 11, lawmakers wanted to know whether Washington had voiced an opinion about British defense spending.\n\nWilliamson said the U.S. Defense Department and others in the states had contributed to the defense review, but the subject of money hadn\u2019t been on the agenda formally or informally.\n\n\u201cWhat they have asked is to make sure we have the right capabilities. But we have not had a discussion about defense spending. ... They have put a very high value on the capabilities we have, and they would be very concerned to see that capability eroded,\u201d Williamson told the committee.\n\nThe defense secretary specifically noted \u201cmassive ticket items that the U.S. sees as pivotal for the defense and security of NATO members\u201d:\n\nRapid deployment of troops as part of NATO.\n\nSpecial forces.\n\nThe new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier battle group.\n\n\n\nThe nuclear deterrent.\n\n\n\nCountering the uptick in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic.\n\n\n\nWilliamson also mentioned the Royal Navy\u2019s mine-hunting capabilities and said Britain is a world leader in terms of technological development done in partnership with the U.S., asserting that in some cases the U.S. is further behind Britain.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, senior U.S. military and diplomatic figures voiced concern over Britain\u2019s declining defense capabilities as spending slipped close to falling below the NATO-set spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThey [the U.S. administration] recognize that our commitment to 2 percent is something to be praised and is an important signal to other European nations to be spending at that same level,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nEarlier this month, Woody Johnson, the U.S. ambassador in London, urged Britain to increase its defense spending.\n\n\n\nThe Defence Modernisation Programme is meant to prioritize British capabilities and programs, in part to reflect the rapidly changing threat posed by Russia and others since the Strategic Defence and Security Review was published in 2015.\n\nThe MoD, which is facing a multibillion pound black hole in the defense equipment and other budgets over the next few years, will have to find significant cuts from efficiency gains and other measures to balance the books. The department is also fighting for more money from the Treasury to stave off cuts.\n\nDefense funding problems took a new knock Tuesday when the National Audit Office, a government-spending watchdog, warned that the program to design, build and support nuclear submarines over the next 10 years faces a \u00a36 billion funding gap."

    "text": "Turkey won\u2019t strike a deal on purchasing American-made Patriot air defense missile systems if the US ties it with tearing up the existing arms contract with Moscow, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u201cThe S-400 deal has already been finalized. We can agree with the US on the Patriot system, but not if there will be [a condition] to abandon the S-400s,\u201d the minister stated on Thursday, as quoted by NTV.\n\nAlso on rt.com US tells Turkey to give up on Russian S-400s in exchange for Patriot systems deal \u2013 report\n\nTurkish media reported earlier that the contract presented by the Americans says the missiles will only be delivered if Ankara abandons the S-400 purchase.\n\nThe US Department of State approved the sale of 80 Patriot missiles and 60 PAC-3 missile interceptors last month. Cavusoglu confirmed that Ankara received a formal proposal to buy the weapons and will consider the terms. But in no way should Washington attempt to meddle in the nation\u2019s arms deals with other partners, the minister warned.\n\nNATO allies can get whatever air defense systems they want.\n\nThe deal to buy Russia\u2019s advanced S-400 air defense missile system was signed by Ankara last year following lengthy negotiations. The first batch of S-400s is scheduled to be deployed in October.\n\nAlerted by the Russian-Turkish talks, officials in Washington unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade its ally from dealing with Moscow. Last year, Congress passed a law effectively blocking the shipment of 100 F-35 jet fighters to Turkey. Lawmakers cited the risks that the sale of S-400s poses to the US and NATO.\n\nUS diplomats and military officials similarly tried to pressure India out of buying the S-400 as the transaction could potentially violate American laws on sanctions placed on Russia. According to local media, Washington even proposed granting New Delhi a free pass on receiving arms from Moscow if it also buys the US\u2019 F-16 aircraft.\n\nDespite pressure from overseas, Turkey and India maintained that they can freely choose partners in the arms trade without interference from Washington or anybody else. \u201cWe don\u2019t need permission from anybody\u201d to purchase the S-400s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in September.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

The Mirage F1Ms were predominantly flown by the Spanish Air Force and received a full radar and avionics suite modernization in the late 1990s. This acquisition along with the most recent purchase of twelve supersonic radar equipped South African Denel Cheetah fighter jets increased Draken\u2019s fleet size to over 150 fighter aircraft.\n\nWith the completion of the procurement phase, the Mirage F1Ms will now undergo reassembly, restoration and airworthiness certification by Paramount Aerospace Systems at Draken\u2019s Lakeland, FL maintenance facility. Paramount Aerospace specializes in the modernization of fixed wing platforms including leading the previous modernization of the Mirage F1M while still in Spanish Air Force military service. Paramount possesses extensive capabilities on the Mirage F1 with full airframe and engine overhaul capability, as well as the ability to upgrade and modernize avionics and mission systems.\n\n\"We are looking forward to working with one of the few companies in the world that possesses the extensive depth of F1 experience and knowledge that Paramount brings to the table. We are especially confident given Paramount's experience modernizing the same Mirage F1M jets we now own when they were in prior Spanish Air Force service,\" said Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International. Draken\u2019s core competency is its ability to acquire, regenerate, modernize and operate affordable, supportable, credible and capable fighter aircraft. This is demonstrated by the over 150 fighter aircraft Draken has acquired in the last 6 years and the numerous government contracts being supported in the United States DoD and abroad. Draken also remains dedicated to tracking and evaluating aircraft globally with proven success operating fleets of aircraft that include the Mirage F1M, Denel Cheetah, A-4 Skyhawk, L-159 Honey Badger and Aermacchi MB-339.\n\nParamount Group acquired the entire South African Mirage F1 fleet, along with spares, simulators, training aids and other related material. The Mirage F1 represents an ideal solution for low cost Super Sonic Fighter capability, and Paramount offers a complete air-power package, with full training and technical support for the aircraft. Paramount also operates a fighter aircraft pilot training Academy in South Africa, the only one of its kind on the African continent.\n\nIvor Ichikowitz, Group Chairman of Paramount Group said, \u201cWe are extremely excited by the partnership with Draken International and the establishment of long-term relationships in support of the US Air Force. There are very strong synergies between our organizations in meeting the ever-increasing demand for the effective utilization of legacy aircraft in adversary training. Our collaboration with Draken underlines the importance of strategic partnerships for providing flexible, scalable and affordable solutions for the US Air Force.\u201d\n\nAbout Draken International\n\nDraken International is the world\u2019s largest operator of ex-military aircraft. The company is based out of Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, FL.

It lacks the equipment that was onboard the third vessel,\" the source said.\n\n\"The work continues, and the missing equipment is expected to be delivered to the customer in the summer,\" the source specified.\n\nIn January, the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation reported that after a storm in the English Channel the third vessel returned to the port of shipment for inspection of the support equipment and assessment of the damage under the specified insurance event.\n\nThe Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation declined to comment on the information provided by the source.\n\nThe contract with China\n\nIn November 2014 it emerged that Russia signed a contract with China to deliver S-400s, and in November 2015 Russian Presidential Aide for Military-Technical Cooperation Vladimir Kozhin confirmed the signing of the contract. China became the first foreign client for these anti-aircraft systems. In June 2016, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov reported that the Chinese army would receive the systems not earlier than in 2018.\n\nThe S-400 Triumf is a Russian long-and mid-range anti-aircraft missile system designed to hit attack and reconnaissance aircraft (including aerial vehicles based on stealth technology) and any other air targets under conditions of intensive enemy fire and electronic countermeasures."

    "text": "On Wednesday (14 February 2018), Belgium joined a multinational effort to acquire a European multinational fleet of Airbus multirole tanker\u2013transport (MRTT) aircraft. At a signing ceremony at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Defence Ministers from Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway celebrated Belgium\u2019s official accession to this effort.\n\nThe initiative has been supported by NATO and the European Union. It is an example of effective cooperation between the two organizations when delivering critical capabilities for its members.\n\nDeputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller said: \u201cIncreasing our ability to keep our planes flying - for longer periods and farther distances - has a direct bearing on our ability to defend our citizens and our territories.\u201d\n\nThe project was launched in July 2016 through an order of two Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft by the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and has expanded steadily. With Belgium joining, the multinational fleet will now grow to eight aircraft, which are scheduled for delivery between 2020 and 2024. The aircraft can be configured for air-to-air refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, as well as medical evacuation missions. The multinational fleet will be operated from a Main Operating Base in Eindhoven (Netherlands) and a Forward Operating Base in Cologne (Germany).\n\nThis multinational fleet arrangement will substantially increase European capacity in air-to-air refueling and reduce the over-reliance on the United States in this area. It remains open to other participants."

    "text": "Concerns raised by an opposition member of parliament that Latvia paid too much for the purchase of a large number of used military vehicles from the United Kingdom have been passed to Latvia's dedicated anti-corruption force.\n\nSaeima deputy Andrejs Elksnins of the opposition Harmony party posted images on Twitter of a letter he had received from the Prosecutor General's office saying his concerns had been passed to the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB).\n\nBru\u0146utransportieru 252milj EUR iepirkumu un armijas mehaniz\u0101cijas projektu p\u0101rbaud\u012bs KNAB pic.twitter.com/TOW4LFWN3e \u2014 Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161 (@AndrejsElksnins) August 30, 2016\n\nShortly afterwards he tweeted another letter, this time from the State Auditor, apparently informing him that any probe that agency had launched into the purchase was secret.\n\nValsts kontroles atbilde par bru\u0146utranportieru iepirkumu ir slepena! Iepaz\u012bstoties, saprotams k\u0101p\u0113c! Ir probl\u0113mas! pic.twitter.com/lFKAGE1pTw \u2014 Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161 (@AndrejsElksnins) August 30, 2016\n\nElksnins has demanded to know why the cost of buying 123 used armored vehicles has ballooned from a basic purchase price agreed in 2012 of \u20ac50 million to more than \u20ac250 million after they have been upgraded and fully equipped.\n\nThe CVR(T), or Alvis Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) platform is now four decades old. According to manufacturer BAE Systems, which also has the contract to modernize Latvia's vehicles, 23 countries have bought a total of 3,500 of the vehicles since 1972.\n\nAn interesting history of the vehicles and details of some previous purchasers is found at the Army Guide website.\n\nWith Latvia due to increase its defense spending to NATO's recommended minimum level of 2% of GDP by 2018, more money is certainly going to be spent on procurement, with a corresponding need for scrutiny to make sure it is being spent in the most efficient way.\n\nThe deal has come under fresh scrutiny after Lithuania last week announced its largest ever defense purchase: \u20ac386 million to buy 88 brand new German 'Boxer' armored fighting vehicles.\n\nIf you fancy some military hardware of your own, the British Ministry of Defense has plenty of pre-loved vehicles available at bargain prices - though to collectors rather than allied powers needing rapid mechanization and combat capability."

The eight, collectively valued at R268 969 122, are the forerunners of the Badger, the SA Army\u2019s new infantry fighting vehicle being built by Denel Land Systems.\n\nAs far as heavy weapons are concerned the report notes the import of 16 cannon, worth R19 989 941, from Switzerland; 12 84 mm weapons, worth R4 867 196, from the Peoples Republic of China; 46 grenade launchers (R183 847) from the United States and two Swiss sniper rifles (R167 015).\n\nFrom China, the import of 13 missile launchers worth R1.2 million was approved, as well as two missile launchers from the United States worth R1.3 million. A single mortar system was acquired from Spain, for R362 000.\n\nOn the ammunition front South Africa imported thousands of rounds ranging in calibre from 40mm to 338, 30mm and 7.62 mm as well as 400 specialist rounds for sniper rifles. All told the value of ammunition is over R186 million. The majority of this was for 21 000 rounds of 40 mm ammunition from Bulgaria, worth R175 million. Other large ammunition contracts were awarded to Norway (2 000 30 mm rounds worth R8 million) and Switzerland (1 000 20 mm rounds worth R1.3 million).\n\nOther imports noted in the report include five simulators from Switzerland (R2.4 million); communications equipment from Germany (R69 million); communications equipment from the United States (R65 million); and cameras, thermal imagers and other optics from France, Belgium, Canada and Germany worth a total of R48 million. The 51 thermal imagers from France (worth R46 million) were probably for the Badger infantry fighting vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the NCACC granted 2 245 import permits from 74 countries in the 2016 calendar year. For the 2015 calendar year, the NCACC authorised 2 249 import permits covering 74 countries worth R502 million. This compares to R200 million in 2014.\n\n"

The event was attended also by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Sumangala Dias, members of the Air Force Board of Management and other officers as well as representatives of the Aviation Engineering Division of the M/S CATIC of China, who are partnering the SLAF in this technology transfer project.\n\n\n\nThe Aircraft Overhaul Wing was established at the beginning of the year 2016 with the technical assistance of M/S CATIC. The Chinese specialist are expected to assist and guide the SLAF in establishing the facilities and in the first few overhauls, after which they are expected to withdraw gradually, leaving the SLAF with the capability to independently handle overhauls. Initially the project is expected to handle the airframe overhaul of Chinese origin aircraft although the SLAF expects that the technology acquired will facilitate the overhaul of other aircraft as well.\n\n\n\nThe concept of Technology transfer is a common practice in most countries where foreign origin aircraft are inducted and used over a period of time. The practice permits the user nation to ensure longevity of the platforms that they acquire without having to rely on foreign assistance and having to dispatch aircraft overseas at great expense in terms of both money and time. While the process of technology transfer requires an initial capital overlay, it is justified by the return on investment over the lifetime of the aircraft fleet. At the same time, the process and facilities such as this also help increase the level of competence of the Aircraft industry of the nation as well and creates opportunities for the technicians engaged in such enterprises to obtain gainful employment even after their retirement from Military Service.\n\n"

The LHTEC-Rolls Royce engines were tested on the T129 to conform to Pakistani demands in 2016. TAI hopes it will be able to complete the contract in five years, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe US penalised Turkey for purchasing Russian S-400 long-range air defense systems in defiance of Washington\u2019s warnings, a senior Turkish defense official told Russia\u2019s TASS news agency during the IDEAS 2018 arms expo in Pakistan\u2019s Karachi this week."

    "text": "Uttar Pradesh is set to receive a defence industrial corridor projected to attract an investment of Rs20,000 crore. According to a Business Standard report , the Yogi Adityanath government expects defence manufacturing to be one of the key drivers of industrialization in the state. The problem is, without a coherent manufacturing and acquisition policy from the defence ministry or the central government, achieving that objective will be tough.\n\nThe Union defence ministry is increasingly falling short of funds. So much so that some fear that the fast rising allowances and pension costs are crimping funds for modernization and capital spending, the key drivers for local defence manufacturing. The accompanying chart says it all.\n\nFor instance, in the recent Union budget, less than 10% of the incremental hike in defence allocation went to fund modernization, shows an analysis by Laxman Kumar Behera, research fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). \u201cThe share of pay and allowances and pension in the ministry of defence allocation has been increasing consistently since the mid-2010s. A large part of this increase has come at the cost of the modernisation budget, which now accounts for less than one-fifth of the ministry of defence\u2019s total allocation, down from a high of 26%,\" Behera said in a note. \u201cThis is highly undesirable and needs to be corrected at the earliest for the sake of India\u2019s robust defence preparedness.\"\n\nTo be sure, given the limited government resources, the Adityanath government can bank on the private sector to build the defence industry. But there are shortcomings here too. Despite the government\u2019s good intentions, domestic defence manufacturing has not taken off in a big way. In fact, a section of the private sector is beginning to tone down its expectations, reflective in another Business Standard report which says that a UK defence industry body which represents over a thousand defence firms is shutting its India office.\n\nThe lack of a long-term defence procurement plan and ill-advised conditions such as technology transfer in a stipulated time frame hampered defence sector development in India, says Yellapu Santosh, senior research analyst (institutional equities) at IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd.\n\nAccording to IDSA\u2019s Behera, the paucity of contracts has been a big dampener. \u201cIn defence you only have one customer. You produce against an order or an assurance (which is lacking),\" he says.\n\nBehera says the government should have a two-pronged strategy. One is to fast-track contracts and the tender-awarding process. The second set of measures involves a policy push where the government should bring out Indian industry-specific tenders with time-bound awards (contracts for local production). Incentives for defence investments, such as tax incentives or benefits awarded to infrastructure sectors like power, are also needed. It is only then that the private sector will be encouraged to invest.\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nShare Via"

In a joint statement issued at the time, it was specified that \u201cthe ships will be built by the French high-tech company, Naval Group, in partnership with Abu Dhabi Ship Building Company (ADSB).\u201d\n\nThe contract is significant for Naval Group, given it has never sold anything to the UAE.\n\nThe Gowind corvettes are powered by engines made by Germany\u2019s MTU, meaning Berlin could make the contract difficult to honor. The government is not delivering licenses to export military materiel to either Saudi Arabia or the UAE over their involvement in the war in Yemen and the resulting humanitarian crisis there.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s 2,700-ton corvettes will be equipped with Naval Group\u2019s SETIS combat management system, MBDA\u2019s Exocet missile and Raytheon\u2019s Evolved Seasparrow Missile. It was initially announced that Abu Dhabi would procure the Thales Tacticos combat management system.\n\nThe Emirates News Agency, WAM, interviewed Naval Group CEO Herv\u00e9 Guillou in February during the IDEX 2019 defense conference in Abu Dhabi, and it quoted him as saying that \u201csince the announcement of the deal in 2017, we have been discussing with the UAE authorities to take into account their specific requirements and to provide them with the best answer to their operational need.\u201d\n\nAccording to WAM, the executive also said that \u201cin the frame of the program, Naval Group envisions to transfer technologies and know-how to UAE institutions and to the naval ecosystem, thus developing national sovereign capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

    "text": "Senegal and the Ivory Coast are buying CN235 and NC-212 aircraft from PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) for transport and maritime surveillance duties.\n\nA framework agreement was signed last week during the Indonesia-Africa Forum held in Indonesia between 10 and 11 April. The agreement is worth $75 million and covers the supply of two NC-212-200 maritime surveillance aircraft and a CN235-220 maritime patrol aircraft to Senegal and a CN235-220 to the Ivory Coast for transport.\n\nThe agreement was signed with Belgian company AD Trade Belgium, which is facilitating the deals with Senegal and the Ivory Coast.\n\nPTDI (Indonesian Aerospace) President Director Elfien Goentoro said \u201cthe African market is promising, as it comprises several countries. Geographically, African countries and Indonesia have similarities, so they need several light and medium turboprop aircraft.\u201d\n\nGoentoro said the contracts will be firmed up in July this year and the aircraft delivered in two and a half years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cWe are offering countries in Africa the development of human resource skills and knowledge in the aircraft manufacturing industry,\u201d Goentoro added, saying there are opportunities for African countries regarding upgrades, modifications and maintenance and overhaul of CN235 and NC212 aircraft.\n\nIn December 2016 PTDI delivered a CN235-220 transport aircraft to Senegal\u2019s Air Force. It was ordered in November 2014 via AD Trade Belgium. The aircraft is in a quick change configuration that allows it to be used for paratrooping, medical evacuation, VIP and passenger transport missions.\n\nThis was followed by Senegal\u2019s order in August 2017 for a single CN235-220 for maritime patrol, again through AD Trade Belgium.\n\nBurkina Faso and Guinea have also ordered CN235s \u2013 the Burkina Faso deal for two CN235s was facilitated by PTDI and AD Trade Belgium. Guinea\u2019s single CN235 was acquired from Senegal, which had previously acquired two second-hand aircraft from Indonesia.\n\nPTDI said its maritime patrol aircraft are able to carry out a wide range of missions, such as border patrol, Exclusive Economic Zone monitoring, fisheries policing, pollution monitoring, search and rescue and combating human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nThe aircraft CN235-220 MPA variant has an endurance of 10-11 hours and features a more modern full-glass avionics cockpit system, autopilot, and winglets for better performance and economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CN235-220 MPA aircraft can be fitted with a 360-degree search radar that can detect small targets up to 200 nautical miles away, forward-looking infrared as well as an Automatic Identification System (AIS), and automatic tracking system."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nA Parliamentary panel is concerned about India\u2019s declining defence expenditure \u2014 which is at 1.56% of GDP in 2017-18, down from 2.6% in 2014-15 \u2014 and said the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d in a two-front war.\n\nNew Delhi: A parliamentary committee has taken exception to the low defence expenditure in India, noting that, in the current geo-political scenario, the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d on the question of preparedness for a two-front war.\n\nIt has also expressed concern about the slow rate of increase in indigenisation in the defence sector, and noted that \u201cnothing concrete has been done for implementation of the strategic partnership model\u201d unveiled in May last year.\n\nThese observations are part of the estimates committee\u2019s draft report on \u2018Preparedness of Armed Forces: Defence Production and Procurement\u2019.\n\nMembers of Parliament privy to the deliberations told ThePrint that the committee, headed by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, is perturbed about the fact that India\u2019s defence expenditure, at 1.56 per cent of the GDP in 2017-18 \u2014 down from 2.6 per cent in 2014-15 \u2014 is at its lowest since the 1962 Sino-Indian war.\n\nFrom the data made available to the committee, it was found that defence expenditure had marginally increased since 2014-15, but when compared to the central government\u2019s expenditures, the percentage decreased from 13.15 in 2014-15 to 12.2 in 2017-18.\n\nAccording to a study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which conducts research on global security, the defence expenditure, as a share of the GDP, of China and France had remained the same, increased in case of Saudi Arabia and Russia and decreased in case of the US and the UK in the last decade (2007-2017).\n\nHowever, the estimates committee says in its draft report, keeping in view the scale of GDP of the developed countries, the decrease of India\u2019s defence expenditure as a percentage of the GDP is \u201cmore noticeable\u201d.\n\n\u2018Allocations unacceptable\u2019\n\nThe estimates committee is also \u201cunhappy\u201d about the \u201cabysmally low\u201d share of capital expenditure as a percentage of the total defence spend, which has been continuously declining over the years \u2014 from 39 per cent in 2013-14 to 33 per cent in 2017-18.\n\n\u201cWhat is more worrisome is the situation whereby the procurement has to be adjusted as per the budgetary allocations made by the government, which are not in keeping with the requirements projected as per the long-term integrated perspective plan (LTIPP)\u2026\u201d an MP told ThePrint.\n\n\u201cThe committee finds the present situation unacceptable whereby the allocations are not being made according to the LTIPP, thereby defeating the purpose of having long-term defence plans,\u201d the MP said.\n\nBefore finalising the report, the panel is likely to call the defence minister for deposition, the MP added.\n\nIn 2014-15 and 2015-16, the allocations made at the budgetary-estimates stage consistently got reduced at the revised-estimates level and even the reduced allocations could not be utilised fully. The committee members were, therefore, \u201cnot able to appreciate\u201d the remarks of the secretary, defence acquisition, during the course of deposition that \u201cthey hear from the department of defence that the requirement of the forces is very high and the fund allocation to that extent is not there\u201d.\n\nWhere\u2019s the PPP?\n\nAccording to another MP, the committee is likely to recommend that defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) be given \u201cadequate autonomy and resources\u201d to enable them to operate on commercial basis and sell their products to global customers without depending on the government.\n\n\u201cIn case of conflict, the demands of the national armed forces have to be given primacy,\u201d the committee is learnt to have said in its draft report.\n\nNotwithstanding the government\u2019s constant refrain about public-private partnership in defence, the committee, said a member, has found that \u201cthere is no existing mechanism\u201d to facilitate it in the defence sector.\n\n\u201cThe strategic-partnership model formulated for defence production does not specify a clear role for major defence PSUs. There seems to be a total lack of coordination among government agencies insofar as integrated approach to public-private partnership in defence sector is concerned,\u201d said another member, quoting from the report.\n\nDRDO hauled up\n\nIn its draft report, the committee has come down heavily on the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), saying it has \u201cnot been able to meet the nation\u2019s expectation\u201d.\n\nIn 2015, the Comptroller & Auditor General of India reported that 14 mission-mode projects carried out by DRDO laboratories had failed to achieve their timelines and the probable date of completion was extended many a time.\n\nThese mission-mode projects pertained to the S-band surveillance system, Rohini radars, secure video and fax communication between airborne platforms and ground station Meghdoot and electronic warfare suit for the modified MiG-29 fighters.\n\nA high-powered defence committee said that at least 11 laboratories of the DRDO need to be closed down. The estimates committee has pointed out in its draft report that the functioning of DRDO needs a major overhaul and its contribution in the context of the country\u2019s requirements needs to be re-examined.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "MELLS: BAAINBw Procures Additional Guided Missile Systems\n\n(Source: Bundeswehr; issued April 21, 2017)\n\nOn 31 March the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) signed two contracts with EuroSpike GmbH to procure an additional 1,000 guided missiles and 97 launcher units of the MELLS light multi-role guided missile system. MELLS is the German name for the variant of SPIKE missiles and launchers used by the Bundeswehr.\n\n\n\n\u201cMELLS has been used successfully by the units and we are pleased that the supplementary procurement recently ordered will allow us to take the equipment of our servicemen and -women another step forward,\u201d said Michael Engelmann, who signed the contracts on behalf of the government agency in his capacity as Director of Central Affairs at BAAINBw. Managing Directors Uwe Fahrenholz and G\u00fcnter Lauer were present to sign the contracts on behalf of EuroSpike GmbH.\n\n\n\nThe order for supplementary equipment consists of 1,000 guided missiles and 97 launcher units, including support equipment. The order volume of the two contracts amounts to approximately 137 million euros. Standards laid down in the BAAINBw Contract Management Handbook were incorporated into the contracts to minimize the contractual risks for the public purchaser.\n\n\n\nAbout 1,500 guided missiles and 16 MELLS launcher units have already been delivered to the armed forces on the basis of previous contracts. Most of the additional MELLS systems currently ordered are to be delivered to the infantry from the second half of 2018 onwards.\n\n\n\nThe company EuroSpike GmbH based in R\u00f6thenbach acts as the contractor. The system was developed by the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., which is also involved in the deal as a subcontractor, together with the companies Diehl Defence GmbH & Co. KG and Rheinmetall Defence Electronics GmbH.\n\n\n\nMELLS is a versatile weapon system. The MELLS guided missile can be used against armored ground targets such as main battle tanks at ranges of up to 4,000 meters. Apart from the Bundeswehr, the system is already in service in six other NATO countries and with the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "VICTORIA, British Columbia \u2014 Canada\u2019s purchase of used F-18 aircraft from Australia will do nothing to boost the combat capability of its fighter jet fleet, as it would still lack pilots and technicians, and the current fleet of planes have not seen improvements for years, according to a Canadian watchdog report.\n\nCanada currently operates a fleet of CF-18 fighters but is lacking in a plan to modernize those aircraft for modern warfare, reads the report released Tuesday by Auditor General Michael Ferguson.\n\n\"Flying the CF-18 until 2032 without a plan to upgrade combat capability will result in less important roles for the fighter force and will pose a risk to Canada\u2019s ability to contribute to NORAD and NATO operations,\u201d the report says, using an acronym for the North American Aerospace Defense Command. \u201cWithout combat upgrades, the CF-18 will be less effective against adversaries in domestic and international operations.\u201d\n\nCanada is also in the process of buying used F-18s from Australia to supplement the existing fleet of CF-18s, but Ferguson\u2019s report notes that acquisition will not fix the fundamental weaknesses with the CF-18 fleet, mainly the aircraft\u2019s declining combat capability and the shortage of personnel to fly and maintain those planes.\n\nCanadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Tuesday the federal government will look at the possibility of adding new weapons and defensive systems for the CF-18s, but he did not provide specific details. He also said the used F-18 fighter jets to be purchased from Australia will be modernized, but again he did not provide specific details.\n\nSajjan said the federal government gave direction in 2016 to the Canadian military to recruit more pilots and improve retention of aircrews and maintainers, but such a process takes time.\n\nCanada expects to accept bids in May 2019 for a new fleet of 88 fighter jets that will eventually replace the CF-18s and the used Australian aircraft. Potential aircraft in the competition include Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab\u2019s Gripen and the Boeing Super Hornet."

    "text": "PARIS \u2015 Airbus is cutting up to 3,700 jobs across four European nations as annual production of the A400M military airlifter and A380 superjumbo airliner will be slashed, the aircraft company said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, Airbus estimates the maximum impact of these measures will affect up to 3,700 positions at sites across the company\u2019s home countries of France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe company announced the cuts after a meeting of its European Works Council.\n\nAirbus will seek to offer work to most of the staff hit by the production cuts by moving employees to other programs with rising build rates, the company said.\n\nAnnual production of the A400M transport plane will fall to eight units in 2020 from 15 this year and 11 next year.\n\nThe drop in A380 production to six compares to 12 being built this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis adjustment is based on discussions with the A400M launch customer nations,\u201d the company said.\n\nAirbus called for those talks in a bid to agree on a new delivery schedule, seeking to reduce penalty payments for late shipment of the turboprop airlifter. A new timetable is expected by the end of the year, which would stem the financial charges of \u20ac8.5 billion (U.S. $10.5 billion) booked by Airbus.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nAirbus profits lag amid engine issues, military challenges Airbus maintained its full-year forecast of delivering more than 700 planes but says it depends on engine makers meeting commitments to fixing problems.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman declined to give a figure on the jobs hit on the A400M program.\n\nSeville, southern Spain, is the assembly plant for the A400M, with wings built in Broughton in the U.K.; fuselage in Bremen, northern Germany; and cockpit in Saint-Nazaire, western France.\n\nThe Airbus A400M military transport plane prepares to land after a demonstration flight on June 15, 2015. (Remy de la Mauviniere/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome of the Seville staff could be switched to retrofit of military capabilities on the A400M. The Spanish plant also works on the C-295 tactical turboprop plane and provides aircraft maintenance and repairs.\n\nThe total 3,700 job cuts will fall on 13 factories across the four partner nations, with the company expecting to assign most of the staff to other aircraft programs.\n\nA lower production rate for the A400M seeks to address the problem of the number of aircraft built but then parked on the tarmac rather than promptly delivered to client nations. That excess of inventory arose from the need to fix a problem on the propeller gearbox of the TP400 engine.\n\nSlower production also allows Airbus more time to fit equipment for tactical capabilities rather than deliver the aircraft on time and later recall them for retrofit.\n\nAirbus also expects to use that extra time to pitch the plane in export markets.\n\nA January order from Dubai-based airline Emirates for 20 A380s, with an option for 16 more, gave a lifeline for the double-decker airliners with an annual baseline delivery of six units. That Emirates order was worth $16 billion at list price, though it was likely the airline won a large discount."

Bolivia signed a EUR185 million ($198.8 million) contract with Thales in November 2015 covering 13 radar systems to be used by the military and civil agencies.\n\n\n\nThe radar systems will begin to be installed in groups of two in January 2019. Installation is expected to be completed by December 2019.\n\n\n\nThe systems consist of seven active radar systems and six passive radar systems, also known as secondary radars. The active radars, which consist of four air defense systems, one Star 2000 primary surveillance radar, and two TRAC approach radar systems, will be operated by the military. The six RSM970 secondary radar systems will be operated by civil agencies.\n\n\n\nThe military radar systems will also have a three-dimensional detection capability. They will be able to detect distance, altitude, as well as speed.\n\n\n\nEach device will start operations gradually because, once installed, there will be a period of approximately one and a half months in which all systems are tested, then calibration flights are carried out to fine-tune the sensors. Only at the conclusion of these tests, will the radar systems be officially declared operational.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Bolivian military personnel will need to be trained in the operation of the radar systems. Operators will learn how to interpret data received by the radar systems as well as how to direct the radars to observe specific locations. Four military and four civil officials have already traveled to France to receive the training. Those eight individuals will train other operators in Bolivia.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 Naval Group, a French shipbuilder, sought to play down media reports of a potential collapse of talks for a major contract with Australia for 12 ocean-going submarines, with elections looming next year in the Commonwealth nation.\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of pursuing the strategic partnering agreement,\u201d a Naval Group spokesman told Defense News. That agreement covers some 30 years and is an extremely close commitment, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is plain logic that that takes time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not particularly worried. We remain confident.\"\n\nNaval Group is working under a 2016 design and mobilization contract on the Australian future submarine program, while negotiating the strategic partnering agreement. The latter is a critical contract which moves the French company closer to building the diesel-electric boats in Adelaide under an Australian $50 billion (U.S. $36 billion) deal.\n\nAustralia officially announces $26B frigate contract. Here are the build details Who's building and contributing what for Australia's Future Frigate, and what technology is involved in the Type 26 design?\n\nThere is concern that failure to reach consensus on intellectual property and warranty conditions have held up a signing of the strategic partnering agreement, with time running out, Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\n\u201cNegotiations on that document have stalled and it is feared they may not be resolved before next year\u2019s federal election,\u201d ABC reported. Signing the strategic partnering agreement by the end of this year is needed to allow detailed design contracts to be finalized and building of the boats, the broadcaster reported.\n\nIn Australia, Defense Minister Christopher Pyne sought to calm the waters with an Oct. 1 reply on social media.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThere is no delay to the delivery of 12 Future Submarines. Negotiation of strategic partnering agreement is continuing & we will ensure we end up with an equitable & enduring agreement to deliver the capability our servicemen & women need, and get the best deal for Australian taxpayer.\u201d"

Neither the state-owned company nor the Slovak Defence Ministry commented on the order, citing classified character of the information.\n\nLOTN shall repair at minimum ten and at most 36 Mi-17 combat helicopters of Russian manufacturing, according to the contract. Should the whole contract be fulfilled, the order would amount to almost a ten-fold of the annual revenue of the company.\n\nCompanies from other countries were also interested in the order, according to HN \u2013 including the Czech LOM Praha firm. \u201cThis tender does not involve helicopters damaged in fights but in general repairs of Mi-17 V5 helicopters,\u201d the daily cited LOM CEO Roman Plani\u010dka. \u201cIn this tender, LTON has been selected by the supplier.\u201d\n\nThe Slovak company LOTN struggles in the long term with a lack of orders, being fully dependent on the Slovak Defence Ministry\u2019s orders. The Slovak cabinet wanted to hire the firm to a private company but the ministry last year scrapped the tender, arguing that the bidders interested in hiring the company would probably not guarantee its revival and the keeping of employment.\n\nThe value of the order could amount up to \u20ac110 million, the Sme daily wrote.\n\n3.

Gen. Galileo Gerard Kintanar, commanding general of the air force, earlier confirmed that the technical working group prefers the T129 and has passed the recommendation to procure the helicopters before the Department of National Defense (DND), the report read.\n\nThe DND would then engage with TAI for the possible government-to-government deal between the two countries.\n\n\"While specifics remain unclear, that would no doubt represent a landmark deal for the defense relationship between the two countries, where defense equipment transfers and sales have been discussed but have yet to manifest themselves in concrete, significant deals,\" Prashanth Parameswaran wrote on his article in The Diplomat.\n\nThe Diplomat stressed that both the Philippines and Turkey would have to take a number of steps to finalize the agreement as Philippine officials have no final decision yet.\n\nIf the deal pushes through, \"the acquisition is expected to be facilitated through a government-to-government deal between the Philippines and Turkey, possibly involving credit provided by Turk Eximbank, Turkey's official export credit agency,\" Jane's also reported.\n\nIn February, the DND terminated a contract for the procurement of 16 helicpters from Canadian Commercial Corp after Ottawa raised concern that the choppers might be used in human rights violations.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte ordered the scrapping of the contract due to supposed conditions being imposed for the agreement.\n\nWhat prompted Duterte to cancel the deal were the remarks of Canada's top diplomat to conduct \"extremely rigorous\" human rights analysis of any potential export of military equipment to the Philippines. \u2014 Patricia Lourdes Viray"

    "text": "The U.S. State Department recently approved the potential sale to Finland of more than $800 million worth of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, Mk 41 vertical launch systems, and other associated items. Depending on how that country decides to proceed with its Squadron 2020 naval modernization program, some of those systems could go into a new class of ice-breaking multi-purpose corvettes, as well as end up on older ships as part of various planned upgrade projects. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. military\u2019s main foreign military sales office, announced the possible arms packages in three separate notices in February 2018. The announcements say that the 100 RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ Extended Range missiles, plus another dozen older RGM-84L-4s that Finland would upgrade to that standard itself using conversion kits, would arm its existing Hamina-class missile boats and shore-based coastal defense batteries. The 68 RIM-162s, also known as ESSMs, and the four Mk 41s would be part of the armament package on the four all-new corvettes the country is building under the Squadron 2020 plan.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that U.S. government approval does not mean a country has agreed to purchase the weapons or other systems in question. Finland is in the middle of a competition to select a new anti-ship missile to replace its existing Swedish-made RBS-15 Mk IIs and Boeing\u2019s Harpoon is just one potential option. The other contenders are the RBS-15 Mk III+ from Sweden\u2019s Saab Bofors Dynamics, the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from Norway\u2019s Kongsberg, and latest iteration of the European missile consortium MBDA\u2019s Exocet MM40. The same is true, perhaps even more so, with regards to Finland\u2019s future multi-purpose corvettes. The Finnish Ministry of Defense is pursuing a two-track plan to develop and purchase those ships, having hired the country\u2019s own Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) to craft the basic hullform in April 2017.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia The Finnish Hamina-class missile boat Tornio, which could receive Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of a ongoing upgrade program.\n\nIn 2018, Finland expects to award a separate contract for the systems that will go into those ships. Germany\u2019s Atlas Elektronik, the Canadian subsidiary of American firm Lockheed Martin, and Swedish defense contractor Saab are bidding on that deal. Atlas Elektronik and Saab both already supply systems for various Finnish Navy ships. How RMC defines the basic ship design and its capabilities is likely to have impact on whether or not the new corvettes will feature the Mk 41s, which can hold four ESSMs quad-packed in each launch cell. The Sylver vertical launch system from France's DCNS is another option, but would require Finland to also choose MDBA's Aster surface-to-air missile as the ship's primary air defense weapon. And though the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s plan does call for the new corvettes to have a robust local air defense capability, it won\u2019t necessary be the main focus for the engineers at RMC. \u201cIn the initial phase it was recognized that this type of new vessel with the required capabilities did not exist,\u201d according to an official primer on the Squadron 2020 project. \u201cThe vessels on the market were not capable of mine-laying and navigating in ice,\u201d it continues. \u201cFor a warship, the requirements arising from mine-laying and winter navigation are rare in the international context but they are essential for the Finnish Navy to fulfil its tasks.\u201d\n\nFinnish Ministry of Defense A rudimentary breakdown of the systems the Finnish Ministry of Defense wants on the new Squadron 2020 corvettes.\n\nFinland\u2019s shoreline is entirely along the Baltic Sea, much of which is frozen over or otherwise full of potentially dangerous ice floes during the winter. Some of the Finnish Navy\u2019s ships, such as its two aging H\u00e4meenmaa-class minelayers, do have a limited ice-breaking capability, but its smaller missile boats, such as the Hamina-class, have much more difficulty operating under those conditions. \u201cThe endurance and sea-going capabilities significantly limit the performance of the Hamina-class \u2026 in ice conditions and during rough sea,\u201d the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s guide to the Squadron 2020 program notes. On top of the ice, \u201cgale-force winds and the resulting wave heights restrict the operation of light naval units on the open sea. The significant wave height may reach six meters and more annually in the northern part of the Baltic Sea.\u201d The Baltic is already an extremely confined space without those environmental hazards and an all-weather ice-capable warship would be invaluable for the Finnish Navy. Finland isn\u2019t alone in recognizing the importance of having combat vessels that can operate in extreme cold weather conditions, either. Russia, Finland\u2019s most likely potential opponent in the region, is also developing ice-breaking anti-ship missile armed corvettes, though it will most likely deploy to support the country\u2019s expanding military operations the Arctic.\n\nPella Shipyard Russia An artist's rendering of Russia's future Project 23550 Ice-class missile armed, ice-capable corvette.\n\nIt\u2019s the constraints of the Baltic that also make maritime mine warfare particularly attractive in both offensive and defensive scenarios. This is again especially true with regards to Russia, which has significant naval assets based in St. Petersburg and elsewhere. Already historical antagonists, relations between the two countries have been steadily worsening in recent years, with Finland increasing its cooperation with the United States and other members of the NATO alliance and Russian officials threatening to retaliate economically and militarily in response. Finnish authorities already accuse Russian military aircraft of routinely and provocatively violating their airspace. In a naval engagement, Russian ships and submarines would have to transit through the Gulf of Finland \u2013 less than 100 miles across at its widest point \u2013 to get into the Baltic Sea proper and Finnish mines could easily constrain their movements. It could also limit the ability of naval reinforcements from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave to the south or elsewhere to rush into the area in a crisis. As such, minelaying is an extremely important capability for the Finns, who have various dedicated minelayers already in service. In addition, depth charge racks on its small missile boats, they can also deploy mines. The primary type in Finnish service is Patria\u2019s Sea Mine 2000, which reportedly has features that make it hard to detect and multiple sensors \u2013 possibly including acoustic, magnetic, and other types \u2013 to both detect potential targets and discriminate between them to focus on the most valuable ships in a task force.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia Patria's Sea Mine 2000."

The aircrafts started to manufacture in Russia with a license issued by the state enterprise Antonov.\n\nBesides, Ukraine supplied shipborne gas turbine constructions DS-71 to Russia, produced by the NPK Zorya-Mashproyekt in Mykolaiv (they were equipped with three Russian frigates of the project 11356). The Ukroboronprom claims that they had been delivered before the ban on the export of weapons to the Russian Federation came into force."

(S-400 units have so far been deployed to Kaliningrad along the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea region, Syria covering the eastern Mediterranean Sea, as well as in Russia\u2019s Far East.)\n\nThree additional S-400 regiments are slated for delivery by the end of 2016, according to an official in the Russian defense industry, which will bring up the total number of S-400 regiments to 16. One S-400 regiment is divided into two battalions. Each battalion consists of eight launchers and 32 missiles in addition to acquisition and engagement radar systems and a command post.\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, the S-300, the S-400 air defense system features an improved radar system and updated software; it can purportedly can fire four new types of surface-to-air (SAM) missiles in addition to the S-300\u2019s 48N6E, a vertical tube launched, solid fuel, single stage SAM with an estimated range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and the improved 48N6E2 missile with a reported range of 195 kilometers (121 miles).\n\nOne of the S-400\u2019s new missiles is the so-called 40N6 SAM with an estimated operational range of 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) and an altitude of up to 185 kilometers (607,000 feet). The missile is reportedly capable of exo-atmospheric interception of intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads in their terminal phase. However, it is unclear whether the weapon is operational in Russia yet and no images of the 40N6 SAM have surfaced so far.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe S-400 is also armed with an improved variant of the 48N6E2 with an alleged range of 250 kilometers (160 miles). The air defense system can also fire two additional missiles, the 9M96E and 9M96E2 with respective ranges of 40 km (25 miles) and 120 km (75 miles). Improved S-300 air defense systems such as the S-300PMU-2 Favorite (sold to Iran), can purportedly also fire the 9M96E and 9M96E2.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

It can engage stand-off jammer aircraft, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, and both ballistic and cruise missiles in an electronic countermeasures environment. Russia is also working on a newer long-range air defense system, the S-500 Prometheus, which will specifically be designed to intercept up to ten ballistic missiles simultaneously."

    "text": "BEIRUT \u2014 Four years after Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi took charge of managing the country\u2019s affairs, dozens of military-owned companies have flourished and the Army has undergone a rapid military buildup, a reflection of Egypt\u2019s efforts to return to prestige.\n\nTo strengthen this progress, el-Sissi stressed in July the importance of continuing the development of companies and factories affiliated with the Ministry of Military Production, as well as enhancing the national industry, exporting surplus production and developing military products to cover the needs of the Armed Forces. He also underlined the need to boost cooperation between the ministry and major global companies to acquire modern technology and bolster local innovation.\n\nAssuming the president\u2019s plans are a success, Egypt could expand its defense-industrial base beyond domestic requirements, and toward global competition.\n\nMilitary-technical cooperation between Egypt and other countries \u2014 mainly Russia, China and the United States (the two former of which have an interest in dislodging the latter\u2019s influence in the Middle East) \u2014 has reached \u201can unprecedented level during the last two years,\u201d according to Mohamed al-Kenany, a researcher at the Arab Forum for Iranian Policy Analysis.\n\n\u201cThis period has witnessed a number of frequent visits and meetings between the minister of military production, Mohamed el Assar, and a number of defense ministers, ambassadors and heads of international defense companies,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those strong relationships have translated into global cooperation, explained Ahmed Kamel al-Beheiri, an expert in regional security issues at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.\n\nA jet sale to Egypt is being blocked by a US regulation, and France is over it France is seeking to reduce its reliance on U.S. approval for French arms exports as Washington withholds clearance for an American component on the French Scalp cruise missile.\n\n\u201cThis [is reflected] by the transfer of experience with the Russians in the air defense systems field, Germany in the maritime manufacturing and light weapons domain, and China through unmanned aerial vehicles and its complementary technology,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIn terms of potential domestic production, al-Beheiri noted that Egypt is currently working a strategy to increase capabilities \u201cthrough a joint cooperation with international companies for the transfer and localization of both hard and soft technologies within the military forces arsenal \u2013 especially one that concerns the air defense missile field.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, manufacturing light and medium weapons is considered a vital realm to the Egyptians nowadays,\u201d he added.\n\nIn terms of exporting some potential weapons, al-Beheiri sees potential in the near future, especially as \u201cEgypt has already begun exporting some types of weapons to both African and Arab countries, such as Iraq.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the big nations with which Egypt is looking to partner. Al-Kenany noted that South Africa\u2019s Paramount Group has been in talks with the Egyptian government for several months, with an eye on expanding \u201cEgypt\u2019s military manufacturing capabilities and strengthen its status as an arms export source for several African countries.\u201d\n\nThat could include establishing a modern defense complex to produce various military equipment, including armored vehicles.\n\nBut China and Russia loom large, particularly as the politics of the last several years have driven a wedge between Cairo and Washington.\n\nAccording to one industrial source who spoke to Defense News on condition of anonymity, American industry is losing its grip on weapon sales to Egypt.\n\n\u201cWashington recognizes that Egypt is a strategically important partner and a large [customer in the] U.S arms market. So we can suppose that there is a clear American fear of the Egyptian side falling into the arms of the Russians or Chinese,\u201d the source said. \u201cMoscow has been able to consolidate its position as a major force in Syria and succeeded in attracting Turkey to its side; therefore, Washington will not allow Cairo to withdraw towards Moscow or repeat the Turkish experience by stepping out of the American abyss.\u201d\n\nBut al-Kenany is convinced that the U.S.-Egypt industrial relationship is \u201chealthy.\u201d"

The \u201cTed Diro\u201d is the first of 21 GCPBs to be gifted to 12 Pacific Island Nations and Timor-Leste under the Commonwealths Pacific Maritime Security Program.\n\nThe Guardian Class Patrol Boat was designed and constructed by Austal Australia for the Commonwealth of Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Replacement Project, comprising 21 vessels to be delivered to 12 Pacific Island nations and Timor Leste. Image: Austal.\n\n\u201cAustal are proud to deliver this program for the Commonwealth of Australia. The Guardian Class has brought together the industry-leading skills of over 200 Austal employees, and estimated to have employed an additional 200 people indirectly through the design, construction and sustainment process.\n\nThe Guardian Class is the latest evolution of Austal\u2019s proven patrol boat platform that was first introduced some 20 years ago, commencing with the Bay Class Patrol Boat developed for the Australian Customs Service. Since 1998, Austal has delivered 32 patrol boats to the Commonwealth \u2013 representing Australia\u2019s entire border patrol capability. Indeed Austal has delivered or has orders for a total of 97 patrol boats for Australia and around the world.\n\nOver the past six weeks, we have had the Ted Diro crew from the PNG Navy at Austal training on how to use and maintain the new vessels. Their positive feedback on the greater capability, amenity and operability of the Guardian Class has been fantastic. We look forward to show casing the new vessels to the other Pacific Island nations over the life of the 21vessel program through to 2023\u201d. Austal CEO, David Singleton said.\n\n\u201cThis is Austal\u2019s first major ship building program in steel. It is a reflection of the skills, experience and management of the Austal team that, since May 2016 they have developed a brand new production facility at Naval Base in Western Australia, designed a production line process, completed the detailed vessel design and are now delivering the first vessel 30 months later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe program is now in a full rate of production, with the second vessel, which is destined for Tuvalu, successfully launched on Monday with an additional three vessels in various stages of construction. Austal are already looking at export opportunities for the GCPB\u201d Mr Singleton said.\n\nThe Pacific Patrol Boat contract was awarded to Austal in May 2016 with a contract option in April 2018 taking the program to 21 vessels valued at AU$335 million. The program supports more than 200 direct jobs at Austal and more than a further 200 indirect jobs through the Australian industry involved in the program. Austal has around 1000 employees in Australia directly contributing to delivering a strong domestic and export shipbuilding industry."

Troop compartment is located at the rear. Its layout is similar to that of Western designs. Now the armored personnel carrier is in service in four countries.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the BTR was actively used during military operations in the East of Ukraine in 2014 and 2015. Almost 80 BTR-4E enhanced Ukrainian Army during military operation in the East of the country. Also the fact that BTR-4 has repeatedly proved its endurance on the battlefield in Iraq.\n\nTurkey\u2019s FNSS Savunma Sistemleri armoured vehicle manufacturer promotes its 8\u00d78 Pars II armoured vehicles. FNSS claims that the hull design of the Pars II offers a higher level of protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), with all crew members provided with blast shock mitigation seats.\n\nThe vehicles employ the latest designs and technologies with a focus on the performance and durability of modern military operational requirements. The vehicles are available in 4X4, 6X6 and 8X8 configurations. The PARS family of vehicles takes its name from the \u201cAnatolian Leopard\u201d."

Changes include the country\u2019s engagement with a wider range of international partners, as well as a commitment to address the country\u2019s post-conflict concerns.\n\nThese changes have been pursued within a new and overarching foreign policy framework that is perhaps less well-known \u2014 a framework of positioning Sri Lanka to become a vibrant and prosperous centre of the Indian Ocean. Developed by the post-2015 government in view of increasing prosperity and competition in the Indian Ocean, this foreign policy framework builds on Sri Lanka\u2019s established status as a non-aligned, South Asian nation.\n\nThe rise of Asia, spearheaded by China\u2019s rapid growth, has transformed the Indian Ocean into one of the world\u2019s busiest East\u2013West trade corridors. It carries two-thirds of global oil shipments and a third of bulk cargo. Growth in the Indian Ocean is robust, benefiting from a rich natural resource base, vast fish stocks and a talent pool of educated youth. Economic reforms in India, Sri Lanka and others are unleashing the private sector as the engine of growth.\n\nThe 28 dynamic economies that border the Indian Ocean across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific are expected to collectively grow at about 6 per cent per year in the next few years, compared with only 3.7 per cent for the fragile world economy. Per capita income in the Indian Ocean region is expected to nearly double from US$3200 to US$6150 between 2017 and 2025, which would make it an upper-middle income region.\n\nThis represents a huge economic opportunity for Sri Lanka, which is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka relies on open sea lanes for its imports of petroleum, food and machinery, and its exports of tea, apparel and rubber products. Sri Lanka plans to become a regional trading, logistics and finance hub, situated between the leading hubs of Dubai and Singapore. Among other initiatives, cutting red tape and prudent macroeconomic management aim to give birth to an international financial centre in Colombo Port City, which would complement the shift towards services-led development.\n\nBut four external risks threaten to compromise regional peace and prosperity. First, the Indian Ocean is at risk of heightened competition between big powers, similar to what is transpiring in the South China Sea. An impasse between these powers or a skirmish at sea could disrupt regional trade. Second, natural resources and fisheries are being depleted at unsustainable rates. Third, there are difficulties in containing maritime crimes such as people smuggling, drug trafficking and piracy. Fourth, trade protectionism is on the rise, partly due to a backlash against globalisation, disruptive technological change and a simmering emerging-market debt crisis.\n\nA key point of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy since 2015 has been to revive the country\u2019s support for a rules-based regional and international order. This mirrors what Lee Kuan Yew pursued for Singapore, in the knowledge that rules protect the interests of smaller countries against larger ones. Sri Lanka has been a member of the WTO since 1995 and was a signatory of the pre-WTO General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948. The country also played a role in the development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nIn an important new initiative for a rules-based regional order, the Sri Lankan government convened a landmark conference, \u2018The Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future\u2019, in Colombo during 11\u201312 October 2018. This Track 1.5 dialogue brought together over 300 senior officials and academics from over 40 Indian Ocean littoral states and major maritime users.\n\nAs an island country located in the Indian Ocean and as a smaller state that cannot afford to be a huge military power, Sri Lanka is unable to address the country\u2019s external risks alone. The government, therefore, convened this conference to understand the impact of these risks and to address them jointly with other countries in a transparent and orderly way.\n\nThis approach is a tried and tested method for successful small countries \u2014 Singapore in ASEAN, New Zealand in the Pacific, and the Netherlands in Europe \u2014 that have faced similar risks. The conference laid important groundwork for a future inter-governmental conference to arrive at a shared understanding on the future of the Indian Ocean.\n\nForeign policy, including the Indian Ocean, seems distant from most Sri Lankans\u2019 minds. But complacency would be a costly mistake. A rapidly-changing economic and geopolitical scenario makes engagement with and support for a rules-based order in the Indian Ocean fundamental for Sri Lanka\u2019s future peace and prosperity. In view of the uncertain and possibly thorny path ahead, patient yet determined diplomacy is required.\n\nGaneshan Wignaraja is the Executive Director of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI).

    "text": "(This story originally appeared in on Dec 01, 2018)\n\nIndia is trying to strike a fine balance between the US and Russia, in terms of strategic ties and defence deals as well as combat exercises. Apart from this counter-balancing, India is also stepping-up military ties with the third pole, China, amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.\u201cIndia has been a latestarter in defence diplomacy but is now making all-out efforts despite budgetary, bureaucratic and other constraints. Indian Navy warships, for instance, have made 113 foreign port calls and held 16 exercises/coordinated patrols with different navies this year,\u201d said a senior defence official.In fact, by the time this year ends, India would have held exercises with all the P-5 countries (US, Russia, China, France and UK), apart from other powerhouses like Australia, Japan, South Africa and Brazil as well as Asean countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. \u201cI don\u2019t think any other country has held such a staggering number of exercises with so many nations this year. The exercises promote strategic cooperation, military outreach, confidence-building and interoperability,\u201d said the official.In December alone, the Indian armed forces have chalked up a hectic schedule for exercises with the US, Russia and China, among others. First off the block will be the \u201cCope India\u201d between the Indian and American air forces at the Kalaikunda and Arjan Singh airbases in West Bengal from December 3 to 14.While the IAF is deploying its fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s as well as other aircraft like Phalcon AWACS, C-130Js and IL-78 refuelers, the USAF has dispatched 12 F-15 jets and three C-130H planes for Cope India.Next, the IAF and Russian Air Force will conduct the second leg of their \u201cAviaIndra\u201d exercise at Jodhpur from December 10 to 22 after the first was held at Lipetsk in Russia in September. India and China, in turn, will resume their annual \u201cHand-in-Hand\u201d land exercise at Chengdu military region from December 10 to 23 after the freeze due to the Doklam troop stand-off near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year.That\u2019s not all. Russian warships will head for India\u2019s east coast to hold the \u201cIndra\u201d wargames towards end-December, even as the Indo-UK \u201cKonkan\u201d naval exercise is currently underway off Goa."

    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Information from government documents about a delivery of German Leopard 2 tanks to Singapore in 2017 suggest the city-state bought a new batch of tanks for its Army.\n\nAccording to the register of conventional arms exports released by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Singapore received 18 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in 2017, adding to the seven tanks the German government said it exported in 2016.\n\nThe additional delivery in 2017 brings the total number of this type of tank received by Singapore to more than 170.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how many tanks were ordered or what variant of was delivered. It is also unknown if this latest batch of tanks are brand new or refurbished secondhand vehicles, although the former is unlikely given production of the Leopard 2A4 has ended.\n\nGerman media reports say the manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann was building Leopard 2A7s for Singapore and Qatar.\n\nGermany previously declared it exported 161 Leopard 2 tanks to Singapore between 2007 and 2012 in its reports to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms database. Singapore declared the receipt of 156 Leopard 2A4s during the same period.\n\nThe 2017 delivery forms part of the $93 million worth of conventional arms exported to Singapore from Germany that year, which also included recovery vehicles, parts for tanks, various military vehicles, training and in-flight refueling aircraft, and small arms.\n\nWhen contacted for comment regarding the 2017 deliveries, the ministry told Defense News to refer to its earlier statement. It had previously said that \u201cno other variants of the Leopard has (sic) been acquired\u201d since Singapore announced it had acquired refurbished Leopard 2A4s from Germany in 2006. Singapore announced at the time that it had acquired 96 tanks, with 66 to be refurbished and put into service, with the remaining 30 to serve as spares.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nHowever, the statement does not deny Singapore increased the number of Leopard 2A4s in its possession. KMW declined to comment about the transfer when asked by Defense News.\n\nThe Singapore Army has one active battalion of Leopard 2s, with additional vehicles assigned to training units in Singapore and Germany, where it uses Oberlausitz Military Training Area. Even accounting for those being used as a source for spares, the number acquired so far suggests Singapore has enough vehicles to equip a number of reserve units."

The transition is back and at this very minute is exercising the power of the state,\u201d said Kafando, reported local media.\n\nBurkina Faso's government has been in a precarious state since last week when the presidential guard took over the palace and detained the interim President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Yacouba Isaac Zida. The following day, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, the head of the presidential guard, declared himself the country's new leader.\n\nThe move was met with resistance by citizens, which led to violent protests in the street. It was also condemned by the Burkina Faso military and other government loyalists, as well as the international community, including the African Union.\n\nArmy loyalists gave Diendere an ultimatum Monday, telling him to step down or face a military attack.\n\nA deal was signed late Tuesday between the two sides. Diendere agreed to stand down from the positions the rebels had taken in the capital Ouagadougou, while the army also agreed to withdraw its troops and guarantee the safety of the rebel presidential guard members and their families, according to reports by Mail & Guardian Africa.\n\nThe attempted military coup comes just weeks before national elections were to take place on Oct. 11. The elections were seen as a means to stabilize the country, since they will be the first to take place since former President Blaise Compaore was toppled last October.\n\nRELATED: Reflecting on the Burkina Faso Uprising"

    "text": "Harsha Kakar\n\nRecent reports indicate that China is moving at a fast pace to annex Pakistan as one of its provinces. In other countries where China has invested, and the nations have been unable to pay, they have had to hand over strategic assets to China for prolonged durations, Sri Lanka and Myanmar being examples. In the case of Pakistan, China already has strategic control over its major asset Gwadar, as also of almost all its mineral wealth.\n\nThe first report was of China granting Pak an additional USD $ 500 Million as loan to Pak for it to tide over its financial crises. The Pak economy is in dire straits with diminishing foreign exchange reserves. The loan was granted at a rate of 4.5%. This is the second loan Pak has taken from the same Chinese bank, the earlier being in Oct last year of the same amount. Pak\u2019s dire financial state is being well exploited by China.\n\nThe second was of the Pak senate \u2018recommending courses of the official Chinese language being launched for current and prospective Pak CPEC human resource\u2019. This contrasts with other nations, where those investing learn national language and customs of the countries in which they are operating. Hence, Pak appears to be bending backwards to satisfy China.\n\nThe third report pertains to the Pak government examining a proposal to replace the US dollar with the Chinese Yuan for trade between the two nations after reports emerged that China had \u2018temporarily\u2019 suspended funding for the CPEC over corruption issues. The exchange rate of the Chinese Yuan is controlled by the Chinese government hence Pak would end up losing rather than gaining.\n\nThe fourth was of the Chinese government bypassing the Pak military and directly negotiating with the Baluch Liberation Front(BLF) for ensuring security to the CPEC in \u2018troubled\u2019 Baluchistan. There are reports of China bribing the freedom fighters. Thus, they would be free to target the Pak army and leave the CPEC, which would benefit China. Though the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson denied the same, however comments by Pak were contrary. Pak\u2019s comments were guarded stating that anyone could interact with the BLF, if it benefitted the nation.\n\nFifthly, is China\u2019s support to the JeM and its leader Masood Azhar. It has repeatedly blocked the UN from designating him as a global terrorist. It is this group which has been responsible for most recent strikes in India, including Pathankot and Sunjuwan. Thus, it would now appear that China would soon be controlling anti-India operations of the ISI. Sixthly, is the increased presence of Chinese troops even as far south as Rajasthan, constructing defences for the Pak army.\n\nSeventhly, there are reports of China constructing a naval base at Jiwani, near Gwadar. While Gwadar is already on a forty-year lease to China, this base would enable China to officially deploy forces in Pak. For the present both China and Pak have denied the same. Finally, a consortium of three Chinese bourses have purchased a forty percent ownership of Pakistan\u2019s only stock exchange in Karachi, thereby gaining control over the Pak economy.\n\nPak did appear to indicate some strength of character by cancelling the Daimer-Bhasha dam project to be constructed with Chinese funding, stating difficult financial terms. However, the deep penetration by China in every aspect of Pak society continues unabated.\n\nDiplomatically, militarily and economically Pak is already completely dependent on China. It has slowly taken over the Pak economy, supplies maximum military hardware to them and when international agencies refuse to grant them loans, it comes to the rescue. Diplomatically, it continues to shield Pak in international forums, employing its veto to protect Pak from being censured. Now it appears to be becoming more deeply involved with the country.\n\nIts talks with the BLF is clearly a direct interference in the internal affairs of Pak and goes against the very character of the state. India would never permit any nation to interact directly with any group or leader who operates against the state. The very desire of the Pak NSA to meet the separatists or their being invited by the Pak Consulate for talks had led to calling offofficial dialogue between the two nations. In Pak\u2019s case it gave a rather muted statement.\n\nSo evident is the control that the murder of one Chinese national in Pak, has the government on edge. China demands arrest of those responsible, which the local authorities fail to ensure, only adding to further pressure from China. Pak has created a special force only to ensure security of the Chinese employed in the construction of the CPEC.\n\nPak is soon scheduled to commence repaying back China at an annual rate of five billion dollars a year, solely for its investment in the CPEC. This is in addition to repayment for loans it has taken for shoring up its economy from China and other international borrowers. Financially repayment may be almost impossible as most Chinese companies in Pak have special tax privileges and the earning accruing from Gwadar would be ninety percent with China. As debts mount so would Chinese demands.\n\nSince it already controls the Pak economy and Gwadar, logically the next step would be controlling its foreign policy and military. Thus, the friendship claimed to be \u2018deeper than the ocean\u2019 is the Chinese way of adding to its territory, without as much as firing a single bullet.\n\nThe recent warning of placing Pak on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list, with Chinese acceptance is adding to Pak\u2019s woes and faster takeover by China. It is known that Pak would never be able to provide a satisfied plan of action to avoid being \u2018grey listed\u2019, hence would be economically more affected. Pak would find it difficult to take international loans to survive, hence would be forced to bank on Chinese largesse, falling deeper into their trap.\n\nChina is aware, that though it may gain control of Pak\u2019s assets and even enhance its hold on the country\u2019s policy, but an economically weak nation, packed with militants and hardliners would become more of a burden than an advantage in the long term.This is the time for India to commence forcing Pak into an arms race, breaking its economy and pushing it against the wall, even adding to Chinese problems of shoring up a bankrupt Pakistan.This may compel China to restrict Pak\u2019s policy of supporting terror groups.\n\n(The author is a retired Major General of the Indian Army)"

    "text": "Canada's multi-billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia includes a substantial number of \"heavy assault\" armoured vehicles and a maintenance deal that would see the Ontario-based manufacturer embed teams at multiple locations throughout the kingdom.\n\nCBC News has obtained documents that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 lay out the major elements of the original agreement signed in early 2014 and approved by the previous Conservative government.\n\nThe $15 billion agreement was given the further blessing of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in the spring of 2016 when it began issuing permits for the export of the combat vehicles.\n\nMuch of the heated public debate about the arms sale has taken place in a vacuum because specific details of General Dynamics Land Systems Canada's (GDLS) contract were sealed under a confidentiality agreement demanded by the Saudi government.\n\nBoth the Liberals and Conservatives have used the absence of details to downplay the destructive firepower of the vehicles being sold.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper once described them as \"trucks.\" Before the last election, Trudeau called them \"jeeps.\"\n\nCBC News has obtained internal records that show the deal struck in February 2014 involved 928 of the most modern light armoured vehicles, known as the LAV 6.\n\nOf those, almost 40 per cent \u2014 354 \u2014 are standard troop carriers.\n\nThe order also includes 119 LAV 6 vehicles of the \"heavy assault\" type, with powerful 105 millimetre canons affixed to their turrets, which were still under development at the time the documents were written.\n\nAnother 119 are configured as \"anti-tank\" vehicles and a further 119 are designated as \"direct fire\" support, with a two-man turret and 30 millimetre chain gun.\n\nThe remaining vehicles include ambulances, mobile command posts, VIP transports and recovery vehicles equipped with cranes.\n\nSaudis want details kept quiet\n\nThere has been talk in the defence industry that some details of the order have been modified over the last four years, and that it's possible fewer vehicles may be sold.\n\nThe company was asked to comment on the documents and the current status of the deal.\n\n\"General Dynamics declines to comment due to contractual and confidentiality reasons,\" said Doug Wilson-Hodge, manager of corporate affairs at General Dynamics Land Systems.\n\nDelivery of the first vehicles was slated to begin in early 2017, according to internal Global Affairs Canada emails obtained by CBC News under access to information legislation.\n\nThese are combat-ready vehicles ... certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were. - Cesar Jaramillo, Project Ploughshares\n\nThe government agency that brokered the deal \u2014 the Canadian Commercial Corporation \u2014 also refused to discuss the documents.\n\n\"All details of the contract remain commercially confidential,\" said an unsigned email from the agency.\n\n\"Further, the documents you mention below are not internal to CCC nor the Government of Canada, therefore, we decline to comment.\"\n\nInternal government emails, obtained in 2015 by The Globe and Mail, show the Saudis stipulated that releasing the details of the deal would amount to \"breaking the terms of the contract.\"\n\nStephen Harper personally reassured the late Saudi King Abdullah, in writing, that Ottawa would hold up its end of the bargain, the newspaper reported.\n\nDeal includes 14-year support program\n\nDefence experts and human rights advocates, particularly those who have fought the deal, said the documents represent the first clear snapshot the Canadian public has seen of what the government is allowing to be exported.\n\n\"These documents raise very important questions and I think our understanding of what was announced in 2014 has to change, needs to change,\" said Cesar Jaramillo, the executive director of Project Ploughshares.\n\n\"This shows us that these are combat-ready vehicles and certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were.\"\n\nA Southern People's Resistance militant loyal to Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi mans an anti-aircraft machine gun the militia seized from the army in al-Habilin, in Yemen's southern province of Lahej, March 22, 2015. There are concerns among human rights groups that the Saudis could use Canadian-made armoured vehicles against Houthi fighters in Yemen. (Nabeel Quaiti/Reuters)\n\nThe records obtained by CBC News show the contract between London, Ont.-based GDLS and the Saudis goes much deeper than just than just selling the vehicles.\n\nIt also involves a 14-year support program that covers ammunition, crew \"training in Canada/Europe\" and \"embedded\" maintenance, with a fleet management team in 13 workshops.\n\nThe reference to Europe has to do with training Saudi crews on the gun system, slated to take place in France.\n\nThe service agreement in Saudi Arabia would be delivered through a subsidiary of the Canadian manufacturer located in Riyadh, said the documents obtained by CBC News.\n\nThe support deal is significant on a couple of different levels, said Dave Perry, an expert in defence procurement at the Canadian Institute of Global Affairs.\n\nFor starters, it partly explains the enormous price tag. Most of the value in defence deals today is not in the hardware, but in the long-term maintenance and support services being provided, said Perry.\n\nIt could give Canada \"a fairly significant amount of leverage\" going forward, he added, pointing out that the support deal could be used to apply diplomatic pressure in the event Canada has new concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"If we are simply selling them a piece of equipment and walking away, you don't really have much recourse afterwards to do anything, if they do something that you don't want,\" he said.\n\nRe-examining arms exports\n\nLast summer, images surfaced online that showed Canadian-made armoured vehicles, manufactured by another company, being used by the Saudi state in its long-running conflict against the Shiite population in Qatif, a restive portion of eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of the video clips also showed a light armoured vehicle, apparently manufactured by GDLS, operating in the region of Awamiyah.\n\nThe Liberal government launched an investigation, which ended with \"no conclusive evidence that Canadian made vehicles were used in human rights violations.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland supported the findings, but told a House of Commons committee a few weeks ago that the review caused her to re-examine the arms export system.\n\nAt the same time, the Liberal government introduced amendments to Bill C-47, which allows Canada to join the global arms trade treaty. The changes would, when passed, give the federal cabinet broader powers to deny export permits if there is the \"substantial risk\" of human rights violations.\n\nReleasing the report\n\nFreeland has shown no appetite to revisit the Saudi deal.\n\n\"Let's be clear, from this day forward, I want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard on the export of controlled goods from Canada,\" Freeland said. \"On a matter of principle, Canada will honour, to the greatest extent possible, pre-existing contracts. We can all understand and appreciate the fundamental importance of being able to trust Canada.\"\n\nOfficials in Freeland's office would not answer questions directly related to the leaked documents on Monday. Instead, a spokesman pointed to the ongoing debate over over Bill C-47.\n\n\"We are committed to a new and higher standard for arms exports,\" Adam Austin said in an email.\n\nJaramillo said it would be in the public's interest for the Liberals to release a copy of their recent investigation and to explain how they came to the conclusion that no abuse took place in eastern Saudi Arabia involving Canadian vehicles.\n\nReleasing that investigation report, he said, shouldn't have any effect on the current sale.\n\n\"Before they invoke commercial confidentiality, to shield the Canadian public from this important information, I just want to point out that I don't see how an independent government investigation into human rights violations would interfere at all with the commercial confidentiality of GDLS,\" he said."

    "text": "India\u2019s Republic Day on 26 January 2018 was a unique occasion: Leaders of 10 ASEAN countries were chief guests at the grand parade in New Delhi. Their presence marked a major milestone in India\u2019s outreach to East and Far East nations in a bid to mount a challenge to China\u2019s dominance in the region. The contestations taking place in the broad Indo-Pacific expanse is the 21st century version of the Great Game of the 19th century between Great Britain and Russia and is pitting US, India and Japan against a rising and increasingly assertive China.\n\nIndia\u2019s Act East Policy\u2014successor to the Look East Policy initiated by Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in 1992\u2014has received fresh impetus. Apart from rising competition in the ASEAN region, China\u2019s increasing forays into the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal over the past decade has imposed greater responsibility on the Indian Navy. Consequently, its role has increased in India\u2019s strategic decision-making. And for once, the government is putting its money where its mouth is. Since 2014, the Modi government has moved swiftly to plug gaps in India\u2019s maritime sector and pushed the navy to do more bilateral exercises and send additional ships for overseas deployment in comparison to previous governments.\n\nFor instance, there were seven overseas deployments, Operational Turnarounds (OTS) and surveillance of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) for friendly countries such as Mauritius, Seychelles and Maldives in 2014. That number quickly doubled in 2015 and 2016.\n\nNew Delhi has also reached out to the Indian Ocean littoral states, allocated more resources for bilateral and multilateral naval exercises and finalised the development of two islands for future Indian military bases in the smaller but strategically located countries\u2014Mauritius and Seychelles\u2014besides bolstering the development of military and civil infrastructure of its island territories, the Andaman and Lakshadweep islands.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Modi\u2019s three-nation tour of the Indian Ocean countries in March 2015 starting with Sri Lanka and then to Mauritius and Seychelles, India\u2019s intention to further strengthen India\u2019s long-standing ties with all the three countries got a boost. That time, Modi\u2019s team decided to finalise the lease of two islands\u2014one each in Seychelles and Mauritius\u2014that had been under negotiation for some years. Located in the Western Indian Ocean, these small islands are now being developed with the required infrastructure needed for naval ships transiting through the waters of the western Indian Ocean. This is part of India\u2019s plan to help the Indian Ocean littorals in strengthening their maritime domain awareness capabilities.\n\nDuring the Modi visit\u2014again a first by an Indian Prime Minister in more than three decades\u2014four agreements, including one on maritime security, were signed.\n\nIndia and Seychelles also declared that India will be leasing Assumption Island, one of the 115 islands that comprise Seychelles. It is an uninhabited island, near the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. Along with the Suez Canal, the Mozambique Channel is one of the two main routes for shipping between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. Naval observers have noted that New Delhi\u2019s plans in the Western Indian Ocean are in response to the increasing Chinese forays into the Indian Ocean and hiring Djibouti as the PLA Navy\u2019s first overseas military base\n\nIn Mauritius too, India already has a foothold. Both the security adviser and the head of the Mauritian Navy/Coast Guard have been Indian Naval officers for decades, India had for long resisted basing Indian Military hardware on the Island. That has changed.\n\nIndia is upgrading airfield and port facilities at North Agalega Island, located some 1000 km northeast of Madagascar, for use by the Indian military. This has long been discussed but never acted upon. Using Agalega as a staging point will substantially help India\u2019s maritime reconnaissance efforts throughout the western Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Indian Navy is accordingly gearing up for the upcoming strategic competition with the PLA Navy. Several new plans\u2014from speeding up infrastructure building in Andaman and Lakshwadeep islands to acquiring more assets and inducting more personnel\u2014are now taking off\n\nIndia\u2019s annual joint naval exercise with the United States\u2014Exercise Malabar\u2014is now officially a trilateral one with Japan joining the manoeuvre in the 2017 edition. India\u2019s signing the LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement) in August 2016, after years of hesitation, was a breakthrough moment in Indo-US military ties. On the discussion table for at least 11 years, the previous government was unwilling to take the plunge for fear of being branded \u2018pro-US\u2019, but Prime Minister Modi and his national security team appears to have overcome the hesitation and signalled an unequivocal shift towards a greater defence, especially maritime, cooperation with the United States and its allies.\n\nPart of the reason to go ahead and clinch the LEMOA is also perhaps New Delhi\u2019s way of signalling to Beijing that India is willing to go further than it has gone so far, in maintaining a balance of power in Asia and disallowing China a free run in the geopolitics of the continent. In that context, a tailor-made agreement for India, the diluted LSA, now called the LEMOA, is just the right message to China in the ongoing tussle for influence in Asia. The clarifications notwithstanding, the implementation of LEMOA will be watched keenly by long-time India ally Russia. Moscow has been wary of the increasing India-US bonhomie for the past decade. Consequently, it has made its displeasure clear at being displaced as India\u2019s primary military hardware supplier by the US a number of times. How it will react to the new development will be a matter of interest within the country and to the rest of the world.\n\nThe writer is a strategic affairs analyst, author and founder of BhartShakti.in, a specialised defence website"

Many times, soldiers have been hit even in their own posts, besides being targeted when they are out patrolling.\n\nEven though the Indian Army has retaliated in equal terms, the need was felt for more modern and deadlier sniper rifles.\n\nAlso read: The new danger in Kashmir: Cold, calculating snipers who are wary of close contact\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the new rifles?\n\nThe US-made Barrett M95 is an anti-material rifle which has a range of 1,800 metres. The gun, which is in use with many special forces around the world, is a bolt action sniper rifle chambered in a .50 Browing Machine Gun cartridge (12.7\u00d799mm).\n\nWith an unloaded gun weighing about 10 kg, the M95 first came out way back in 1995, and is part of the Barrett M82 family, the first notable American-made .50 Caliber anti-material rifle introduced in 1982.\n\nThe gun feeds from a five-round detachable box magazine and is a more compact and lighter version than earlier products.\n\nThe other gun that will be available to the troops along the LoC is the Victrix Armaments\u2019 .338 Lapua Magnum Scorpio TGT, owned by Italian firm Beretta.\n\nThe Scorpio TGT uses the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6\u00d770mm or 8.58\u00d770mm), a rimless, bottlenecked, centre-fire rifle cartridge.\n\nIt was developed in the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. It was used in the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War.\n\nAlthough the .338 Lapua Magnum was initially developed to penetrate body armour at 1,000 metres, it has been used effectively to 1,500 metres and beyond, and holds the distinction of being part of some of the record-breaking sniper shots in war.\n\nAt least 30 countries use the .338 Lapua Magnum sniper rifles and over a dozen manufacturers produce rifles, in multiple configurations, in this calibre.\n\nAlso read: Militant snipers add grisly new chapter to Kashmir insurgency with three kills\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

Part of GDIT\u2019s rationale for acquiring CSRA was its belief the federal IT market is a consolidating market, and in order to effectively compete for larger contracts it needed to expand.\n\nIn that sense, the biggest influence on General Dynamics portfolio will be among civilian agencies, particularly State and Justice departments and the Homeland Security Department, according to data company Govini. That said, CSRA will expand the past performance of General Dynamics\u2019 technology services within the DoD by 93.3 percent, according to the Govini report.\n\n"

    "text": "Mali\u2019s air force has taken delivery of four Embraer Super Tucano light attack and trainer aircraft after placing the order three years ago.\n\nThe four aircraft (PT-ZTN, PT-ZTI, PT-ZTJ and PT-ZTF) were seen in Recife on 7 July during their delivery flight from Brazil. They stopped there overnight before heading on to Mali, where they arrived on 10 July. They were officially received by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita the following day at Air Base 101, together with other dignitaries that included Prime Minister Soumeylou Boub\u00e8ye Ma\u00efga, and Chief of the Air Force General Souleymane Bamba.\n\nKeita said the arrival of the new aircraft was part of the rejuvenation of the country\u2019s military and that the need for aircraft was great in such a large nation.\n\nMali signed a contract with Embraer for the six aircraft at the Paris Air Show on 15 June 2015. Embraer said the contract includes logistic support for the operation of these aircraft and also provides a training system for pilots and mechanics of the Mali Air Force. Ten pilots and 17 technicians have been trained on the new Super Tucanos.\n\nIt is understood that the four aircraft delivered are configured for light attack and close air support. It had been suggested the remaining two would be fitted with surveillance systems and used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, including border patrol, but sources indicate the last two were cancelled in order to save money. It has been alleged that Mali\u2019s Super Tucanos were delivered without sighting systems due to American reluctance to supply sighting equipment.\n\nThe first two aircraft for Mali were first seen undergoing test flights in November and December 2016 at Bacacheri Airport in south-eastern Brazil.\n\nBamba said that during the first half of 2018, Mali\u2019s Air Force flew 1 068 missions, accumulating 1 696 flight hours. This included 75 medical evacuations and the transport of 25 prisoners. Reconnaissance aircraft carried out 410 missions, transport aircraft transported over 9 000 people and 78 tons of cargo and combat aircraft flew 359 missions during which they fired 155 rockets and 582 23 mm rounds.\n\nThe Super Tucano delivery is the latest in a series of acquisitions for Mali\u2019s Air Force, which has received nearly a dozen new aircraft over the last couple of years. In October 2017 Keita welcomed the delivery of new aircraft to the country\u2019s Air Force, including a C-295W transport, two Y-12 light utility aircraft, two Mi-35M combat helicopters and a Super Puma transport helicopter.\n\nThe two Y-12E light transport aircraft were delivered from China in early September 2017 and joined a number of Basler BT-67 turboprops in Malian service. The delivery of the two Mi-35Ms was confirmed by Rosoboronexport on 3 October. The Mi-35M sale was announced last year. According to the EU Training Mission in Mali\u2019s September newsletter, Mali has another two Mi-35Ms on order and these will be delivered by 2019.\n\nMali is expanding its Air Force and taken delivery of new transport, attack and training aircraft. In October 2016 the country received its first of two H215 Super Puma helicopters from Airbus Helicopters (purchased for $18 million) and that December a single C295W transport from Airbus Defence and Space. The C295W is being used to provide logistics support, medical evacuation, and troop transport capabilities to the Malian military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by the EU Training Mission, in January 2016 Keita announced the implementation of a military investment plan to the value of 1,230 billion CFA. This plan formed part of the \u201cMilitary Orientation and Planning Law (Loi d\u2019orientation et de programmation militaire, LOPM)\u201d, approved in February 2015. This covers the modernisation of the Malian Armed Forces and the recruitment of 10 000 volunteers. The Malian Armed Forces should number 20 000 by 2019. The plan also includes the reorganisation of the Air Force and the purchase of new aircraft."

The aircraft arrived at Air Station London, Timehri late this afternoon to a water salute.\n\nCommander of the GDF\u2019s Air Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Courtney Byrne explained to the Department of Public Information (DPI) the planes will be able to effectively perform 10 out of the 13 Air Corps tasks.\n\nOne of the Islander arriving to a water salute Chief of Staff of the GDF, Brigadier Patrick West [centre], Commander of the Air Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Courtney Byrne [second right] and Major Mohinder Ramjag, Officer in Command at the Flight Operations Department [second left] among other GDF officials pose in front one of the Islanders A firefighter gets a closeup look at one of the Islanders shortly after it arrived at Air Station London, Timehri\n\nByrne said the aircraft are best suited for Guyana\u2019s rough, mountainous terrain, high altitudes and short hinterland airstrips. \u201cThese aircraft can perform these missions well. They are adapted for this kind of terrain.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Minister of State, Joseph Harmon had sought supplementary provision of $484Million in the National Assembly to procure two Islanders and two Sky vans.\n\nThe Islanders that arrived today were brought in Brazil and flown across the border by a team of GDF pilots. Major Mohinder Ramjag, Officer in Command at the Flight Operations Department, led the team that flew the planes to Guyana.\n\nThe GDF will now have the planes certified and registered by the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). \u201cWe already have highly qualified pilots to fly these aircraft and we have engineers who are also qualified to maintain these aircraft,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Byrne assured that the refurbished planes can provide more than 30 years of service to the Air Corps.\n\nChief of Staff of the GDF, Brigadier Patrick West, and other GDF officials were on hand to witness the arrival of the aircraft. There will be an official handing over ceremony for the aircrafts tomorrow.\n\nBy: Tiffny Rhodius\n\nImages: Keno George"

Markings on these boxes revealed their contents as 60mm mortar shells produced in the state-owned Serbian factory Krusik in 2012.\n\nKrusik said it had sold that particular lot to Zastava, another Serbian state-owned arms factory.\n\nRead more:\n\nUK Missed Chance to Stop Suspect Bosnian Bullet Deal\n\nMaking a Killing: The 1.2 Billion Euro Arms Pipeline to Middle East\n\nBalkan Arms Trade"

In 2005, one of them \u2014 the 200-foot-long HMS Gotland \u2014 sneaked up...\n\nIn terms of modern diesel-electric submarines, it\u2019s hard to beat Sweden. In 2005, one of them \u2014 the 200-foot-long HMS Gotland \u2014 sneaked up and virtually destroyed the American Nimitz-class carrier USS Ronald Reagan in a simulated war game. That was due in part to the ultra-quiet Stirling engines that power the Gotland.\n\nThe Swedish navy, while small, has long reserved funds for submarines given its location and the likely direction of conflict.\n\nThere are many places along the Swedish coast for stealthy submarines to hide, and they would likely face Russian vessels \u2014 the kind that may try to assist in a Russian attack on Sweden, remote as it seems. The Swedish boats\u2019 unique Stirling engines, using Air-Independent Propulsion, gives Gotland\u2013 and Sodermanland-class subs an advantage compared to most navies operating conventional diesel-engine submarines.\n\nBut Sweden at one point considered nuclear submarines. The idea never left the drawing board, but had it, the vessel would have been rather unsafe for the crew \u2014 and possibly anyone else who happened to stray too close to the submarine when the reactor was active.\n\nWith design work beginning in 1957, the proposed nuclear submarine \u2014 called the A-11A \u2014 was also small even by the standards of most submarines at 159 feet long, and contained some interesting design features such as a large hull-mounted hydroplanes, according to a detailed summary by Fredrik Granholm and submarine historian and illustrator H. I. Sutton.\n\nAbove \u2014 a concept sketch for a revolving 10-tube torpedo array used in the A-10, another Swedish submarine design. At top \u2014 the A-11. Swedish military illustrations\n\nThe A-11A\u2019s initial design had six torpedo tubes in a rotating launcher \u2014 firing two at a time like a double-barreled revolver \u2014 which could not reload. That was a limitation, but the design saved on space since there was no torpedo room.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features was the nuclear reactor shielding, or rather an insufficient amount of it, according to Sutton. \u201cThe sides of the reactor compartment were minimally protected meaning that the reactor could not safely be operated in port,\u201d Sutton wrote. \u201cTherefore a diesel generator would be used for maneuvering in port.\u201d\n\nNor would you want to hang around too long in the aft engine room, near the reactor \u2014 three and a half hours at most before hazardous radiation exposure.\n\nIn any case, no sailor ever spent any time in this bizarre nuclear mini-sub, as Sweden canceled the project in 1962. Truth be told, there wasn\u2019t much of a practical use for a small nuclear-powered Swedish submarine, and the design came at an anomalous, odd period in history anyways. In the 1950s, there was a veritable nuclear mania when the world\u2019s powers imagined a future of nuclear-powered cars, trucks, airplanes \u2014 and tiny reactors for the domestic home.\n\nThose concepts didn\u2019t pan out, and by the early 1960s, the hazards of nuclear energy for military use were becoming more apparent. Sweden shifted to its diesel-powered, AIP-augmented conventional submarines \u2014 although the A-11A\u2019s design had an influence on these later hunter-killers. However, the neutral country\u2019s nuclear experiments didn\u2019t end. By the 1970s, Sweden\u2019s civilian nuclear power plants were up and running."

The Wing Loong drone is said to compete in features with the Predator medium altitude long range (MALE) drone made by the US firm, General Atomics.\n\nLast month, the Egyptian Ministry of Defence had shown a video of the Wing Loong drone, taking off with missiles on its hard-points and knocking off a ground target. The publicity video was telecast on Egyptian media on the occasion of the 45th Air Force Day.\n\nThe publication of the video indicates that Egypt may already be in possession of the drones and may have signed up to buy more or them. Besides the Wing Loong, CATIC also manufactures the Harrier, a reconnaissance drone capable of long endurance.\n\nChinese firms generally do not announce sales of military wares to foreign countries. Information published in international media is shared in state-owned Chinese publications with local defence experts commenting on the possible sale."

You can't expect India to go cold turkey on that,\" Harris told the lawmakers.\n\n\"I think we ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India,\" he said.\n\nHarris was responding to a question from senator Tom Cotton who asked about the impact of the recent sanctions legislation (CAATSA) Congress passed, designed primarily with Russia in mind, and specifically countries that continue to use Russian military hardware and systems.\n\nIndia, a major consumer of Russian arms, is one of the countries that would be impacted by such a legislation.\n\n\"I supported that legislation. I still do. But I do have some concerns about potential unintended consequences among countries that, for various historical reasons, still have Russian hardware and it'd be hard to avoid Russian hardware, Senator Cotton said.\n\nHarris expressed hope to achieve some relief for the rigidity that's in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) legislation.\n\nCotton then referred to a classified letter written by Defence Secretary Jim Mattis in which he is seeking exemptions for a number of countries. India is believed to be one of those countries for which Mattis has sought exemptions.\n\n\"I assume Secretary Mattis' point in this classified letter is, do you have a country like India that's a close ally, and growing ever closer, but for historical reasons going back decades, they just rely on a lot of Russian equipment, and would really impair them and therefore, our relationship with them to try to ask them to go cold turkey immediately,\" Cotton said.\n\n\"You are correct,\" Harris said."

    "text": "Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has officially launched an Armoured Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Facility in Maga Maga, near Jinja, which is currently producing the Nyoka armoured personnel carrier.\n\nSpeaking at the launch at Magamaga Army Barracks on Wednesday 8 August, Museveni said Ugandans were waking up, and encouraged further local industrial participation.\n\nIn 2012 the Uganda People\u2019s Defence Force (UPDF) contracted Impala Services and Logistics, sister company of South Africa\u2019s Twiga Services and Logistics, to design a Mamba class armoured vehicle for manufacture in Uganda. In 2012 the first two Nyokas were supplied for operational evaluations. In 2013 the manufacture and assembly of the Nyoka began in earnest in Uganda under a transfer of technology programme which continues today. The Armoured Vehicle Facility at Maga Maga Barracks has produced 20 Nyoka APC and another ten are currently being produced.\n\nBrigadier General Byanyima, the Commander of the Motorised Infantry, said that there are plans to produce a further 13 Nyokas in the near future. Three of the current production lines are planned for use under a United Nations mission.\n\nSince the project started, 42 technicians have been trained to manufacture and assemble the vehicles. Under the Transfer of Skills and Technology Programme, Ugandan technicians have been trained in armour welding, pneumatics, auto-electrical and mechanical skills needed to carry out manufacture of armoured vehicle hulls and the complete assembly of the Nyoka armoured vehicles.\n\nThe Nyoka upgrades required by the Uganda People\u2019s Defence Force were based on their experience using the South African Mamba in battle. The upgrades include ballistic protection equal to NATO STANAG Level 1, shooting ports, a ballistically protected grill, air conditioning, three weapon positions on the roof, pneumatically operated rear doors, an anti-roll bar, improved braking system, infrared illuminator, improved lights and other mechanical improvements. Another requirement was that the Nyoka must use the same logistical footprint as the Buffel and Mamba.\n\nUnder the programme, armour plate is cut and bent in South Africa and shipped out to the client country for manufacture and assembly. Some armour steel is now sourced directly from Sweden, which is cut using a state of the art plasma cutter which was recently installed at the facility under the Transfer of Technology programme. Museveni hinted that in the future, steel may be sourced from Uganda rather than Sweden.\n\nThe Nyoka uses the Mamba driveline (engine, gearbox, axles), which is remanufactured while the rest of the vehicle is 100% new. The engines are remanufactured and certified in South Africa.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson explained that the establishment of the Armoured Vehicle Manufacturing Facility was driven by a careful application of acquisition resources to both acquire armoured vehicles while at the same time develop the indigenous capabilities to maintain, repair, manufacture and assembly armoured vehicles in Uganda.\n\nThe UPDF several years ago was estimated to have 40 Mambas, as well as 20 ex-South African Buffels in service according to the IISS\u2019s The Military Balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwiga Services and Logistics recently supplied four 850 Military Patrol Boats (MPBs) to Uganda under a contract from Impala Services and Logistics. Chief of the UPDF, General David Muhoozi, said plans are underway to establish a marine workshop and a pier. The Ugandan marines plan to increase their boat fleet."

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 German government negotiators have approved a new defense and security direction for the country, coupling boosts in military expenditures with equal increases in foreign assistance.\n\nMonths of haggling over a new government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel culminated Wednesday as leaders of her center-right Christian Democratic Union, its sister party Christian Social Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, or SPD, unveiled a written coalition agreement in Berlin.\n\nInsiders say the topic of defense spending ended up being relatively uncontroversial during closed-door talks, and party negotiators agreed on language that would keep Germany in line with a pledge by NATO members to annually allocate 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024.\n\n\n\nMembers of the SPD had decried that goal as unrealistic and unnecessary during last year\u2019s election season.\n\nIn what could be a nod to critics of a rigid spending goal, the coalition agreement stresses that increases in the traditional military budget would come with plus-ups in fields that also have the potential to solve or prevent global crises. Those could include delivering humanitarian aid or funding educational projects abroad.\n\nArmed drones for Germany? Merkel\u2019s would-be government sizes up defense priorities Here\u2019s a rundown of key national security topics that are up for grabs in a likely coalition of three German political parties.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin on Feb. 7, Merkel hailed the idea of a \u201cnetted security\u201d approach, in which nonmilitary instruments of power would gain greater prominence.\n\nAs a major host of refugees from war-stricken Syria and impoverished North Africa, Germany\u2019s security calculus includes removing the impetus for refugees having to stream into Europe in the first place.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiators put on hold the acquisition of armed drones for the Bundeswehr \u2014 Germany\u2019s armed forces \u2014 until lawmakers can answer all legal and ethical questions involved.\n\nAt the same time, the coalition agreement approves leasing the Israeli drone Heron TP for surveillance. The SPD blocked plans for a weapons-capable version of the aircraft last summer.\n\nAn Israeli Heron TP surveillance drone flies during a presentation to the media at the Tel Nof Air Force Base, south of Tel Aviv, on Feb. 21, 2010. (Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP)\n\nDevelopment of a so-called Euro Drone, a key capability under the emerging defense regime of the European Union, will proceed as planned, according to the document.\n\nThe Bundeswehr\u2019s slow, internal acquisition processes, negotiators wrote, are in line for a major reform effort by the end of 2019. Policies requiring EU-wide program competitions could be waived to achieve greater speed for urgently needed equipment. That also would apply for projects involving technologies deemed key for the domestic industrial base.\n\nIn addition, there are plans for a new agency devoted to developing \u201cdisruptive\u201d cybersecurity and sensitive technologies, the document states.\n\nOverall, the defense section of the coalition agreement strives to strike a balance between Germany\u2019s alliance with Washington and its place as a key player in Europe. While it pledges that Berlin would \u201cbreathe life\u201d into a common EU defense policy, it notes that the Unites States is undergoing \u201cfar-reaching change\u201d that would present great challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will react to this with offers for dialogue and cooperation,\u201d negotiators wrote, adding that members of the new government would seek additional avenues for working with the Trump administration, Congress and state governments."

    "text": "The Pentagon is \u201cvery concerned\u201d over the possible implications of Russian sanctions on defence ties between India and the US, a top defence department official has said.\n\nIndia could face sanctions for purchasing high value military defence items, in particular state-of-the-art S-400 missile defence system, from Russia under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\n\nSection 231 of CAATSA mandates secondary sanctions on those who conduct significant transactions with the Russian defence and intelligence sectors.\n\n\u201cWe understand India\u2019s concern about this and we are very concerned as well. These sanctions are intended to target Russia - not India,\u201d Joe Felter, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for South and Southeast Asia, told PTI.\n\nIndia is currently in advance stage of negotiations with Russia for five S-400 system worth an estimate $4.5 billion. The air defence system includes radar, missile launchers and command center technology.\n\nAccording to some lawmakers, the latest Indian move to purchase S-400 air defence missile from Russia could be considered as a sanctionable activity.\n\nForeign Secretary Vijay Gokhale and Defence Secretary G Mohan Kumar also expressed their concerns over this during their US visit last month.\n\n\u201cWe totally appreciate Indians concerns. It was raised in discussions during senior level meetings last month. We also are very concerned because we very much hope to maintain the momentum and the trajectory of this relationship. We want to deepen our cooperation and not to reduce it,\u201d Felter said.\n\nCAATSA was signed into law in August 2017 and went into effect in January this year. The law mandates the Trump administration to punish entities engaging in significant transaction with the defence or intelligence sectors of Russia.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about anything that\u2019s going to make it more difficult for us to cooperate. But it\u2019s just out of our hands this legislation. I can\u2019t anticipate what will actually happen. Any decision to impose sanctions is made outside of DoD,\u201d Felter said.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to building our relationship and keeping it on the current trajectory. We appreciate that that defence trade is a key activity to build this partnership. We will continue to work diligently to maintain the positive trajectory we are on with this relationship and ideally deepen and expand our defence trade,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the growth in India US bilateral defence trade from almost zero to $15 billion, Felter said there was tremendous growth potential for the bilateral ties.\n\nAtman Trivedi, a former State Department official under the previous Obama Administration said that triggering of sanctions on India because of S-400 deal would \u201cundermine serious American interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cToo much is at stake to allow individual defence transactions to damage a budding relationship with a promising partner like India. Before it\u2019s too late, the two countries should quietly work together to find other arrangements to address India\u2019s defence requirements,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf that is not feasible, Congress should provide India a sanctions waiver or consider a larger legislative fix that allows important US allies and partners, like India, to be exempted,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\nCara Abercrombie, a visiting scholar in the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also argued in favour of exemption for India last week.\n\n\u201cIndia warrants an exemption from these secondary sanctions, as does any country with which the US is forging new and strategically important defence relations,\u201d Abercrombie wrote in Axios, an online publication.\n\nWhile the US has become its second largest defence supplier, mainly of aircraft and artillery, India still relies heavily on Russian equipment, such as submarines and missiles, that the US has been unwilling to provide, she wrote.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions, like penalties the US imposed after India\u2019s nuclear tests in the 1990s, would sour relations. At worst, they could stoke domestic backlash and close off US defence sales to India for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cGiven bipartisan support for the US\u2013India defence relationship, Congress should grant India waiver authority under CAATSA. Without waivers, other important regional partners, like Vietnam and Indonesia, are also likely to trigger sanctions,\u201d Abercrombie said.\n\n\u201cSeventy per cent of their military hardware is Russian in origin. You can\u2019t expect India to go cold turkey on that. We ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India,\u201d Admiral Harry Harris, Commander of US Pacific Command, told a Congressional committee last month."

The upgrade will be done locally by the state-run Ordnance Factories Board at the cost of about $50 million.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade work will involve replacing the existing muzzle brake, breech block and associated modifications to the recoil system, apart from replacing the 130mm barrel with a 155mm barrel.\n\n\n\nThe Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) has received the final confirmation of the contract for the upgrade of 300 artillery guns after the successful user trial of a prototype.\n\n\n\n\"We have successfully enhanced the capability of the artillery gun. Its ammunition is already manufactured by ordnance factories. Recently, the Indian Army has ordered to upgrade 300 such guns,\" S. K. Chourasia, OFB Chairman, told Sputnik.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army had initiated the upgrade of the Soviet era guns in 2008 with the contract being awarded to the Israeli firm Soltam \u2014 now part of Elbit. Soltam's contract was suspended midway after allegations that it had bribed officials. Later, the government had decided to throw open the contract for domestic companies. The state-run Ordnance Factories Board participated in the tender issued by the Indian Army, competing with two other private manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\"After extensive field evaluation trial, OFB's gun has emerged as the only gun system meeting all quality requirements,\" an OFB official said.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army plans to eventually convert all existing field guns into 155mm/52-caliber guns \u2014 wheeled, tracked, self-propelled and mounted \u2014 which will cost approximately $6 billion.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

Haun spoke to Defense News at the Eurosatory trade show for land weapons.\n\n\u201cThis is the right path. This means they will find a solution.\u201d Haun is also CEO of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. Stephane Mayer, CEO of Nexter, is the co-chairman at KNDS.\n\n\u201cThe principle is Germany is on the move,\u201d Haun said. \u201cIt is not a block. It is a process and it takes time.\u201d\n\nArms export is a highly sensitive topic in Germany, with strong debate over the use of German weapons by client nations such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, respectively heavily engaged in Syria and Yemen. A sought-after alignment of French and German arm export policy is key to KNDS. The partner companies, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Nexter, have long competed with each other, but now they seek to work cooperatively to snag opportunities in the world market.\n\nThere is little public controversy in France on arms export, on which successive governments publish an annual report to parliament, giving details of the deals won in the previous year. French media have asked the Armed Forces Ministry when this year\u2019s report will be released. Clearance of foreign arms deals lies in political hands and once policy is set, then companies can pursue their target markets.\n\n\u201cWe are not in charge of external policy of our two countries,\u201d said Mayer. \u201cHowever we wish that they find an agreement, to make things clear from the beginning on how to export the systems.\u201d\n\nIf there is political clearance for sales limited to the European market, then KNDS could focus its efforts. That includes building new factories in Europe, Mayer said. The European market for main battle tanks is worth an estimated \u20ac80 billion (U.S. $93 billion) based on an estimated park of 8,000 tanks, worth \u20ac10 million per unit, Haun said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge market,\u201d he said, of which KNDS aims to win more than half. \u201cWe want at least 50 percent, we want to be market leader.\u201d\n\nThe German Leopard tank accounts for 40 percent of the European market, while the French Leclerc holds 3 percent, so KNDS already controls 43 percent. With an operational life of some 40 years, the sale of service and spares for the tanks would be extensive.\n\nEast European nations will likely seek to replace Russian tanks, or tanks built on Russian design, so the market potential is seen to be there. KNDS unveiled at Eurosatory its European Main Battle Tank, built by fitting the Leopard 2 chassis with a Leclerc turret and 120 mm gun. That display outside the KNDS outdoor chalet marked the market launch of a cooperative effort aimed solely for foreign armies."

The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him that were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and his three children.\"The thug that tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in total fear,\" Trump continued. \"Baghdadi's demise demonstrates... our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long.\"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump for the killing of Baghdadi, calling it an \u201cimpressive achievement.\u201dNetanyahu, who released a statement within moments of Trump ending his press conference where he announced Baghdadi's killing, said that it \u201creflects our shared determination \u2013 of the United States and all free states \u2013 to fight terrorist organizations and terrorist states.\u201dNetanyahu said that while this was an \u201cimportant milestone,\u201d the campaign against terrorism is \u201cstill in front of us.\u201dTrump additionally clarified that no US personnel were killed in the operation, though one dog was injured entering the tunnel. He stated that the number of people killed on Baghdadi's end of the operation will be announced in the next 24 hours.He described watching the operation, which he saw along with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, and several other military and intelligence officials, as something \"like a movie.\"\"Today's events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists,\" Trump stated. \"That also goes for other terrorist organizations. Baghdadi and the losers who work for him, and losers they are, had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases, they were very frightened puppies; in other cases, hardcore killers. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way; as a coward, running and crying.\"\"Russia was great,\" he said, explaining that the personnel as part of the operation had to fly over Russian territory.\"I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us,\" he added.Yisrael Beytenu leader and former defense minister Avigdor Liberman wrote on his Twitter account, saying, \"The US military's cautionary operation based on high-quality intelligence is evidence that the US government and the US security forces are the leading forces in fighting Islamic terrorism.\"Al-Baghdadi was a symbol of the extremist Islam, which suffered a heavy moral and operational blow,\" he continued, explaining that his death proves that terrorists are not safe wherever they are, \"including Gaza and Lebanon.\"Foreign Minister Israel Katz also congratulated Trump on Twitter for the operation, adding that the achievement \"is extremely important in the war against one of the most murderous terrorist organizations of our time\" and that the assassination is \"an important message to the free world that in a determined war, terror can be won.\"\"There is a great urgency to create a no-fly-zone in northern Syria,\" said former justice minister MK Ayelet Shaked in response to the assassination. \"It is imperative this is done to prevent the ethnic cleansing of two million Kurds, and to put radical Islamists in their place.\"She further clarified that such an act is necessary in order to \"prevent ISIS from raising its head and avenging the death of their leader.\"\"The world is a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gone,\" said former education and interior minister Gideon Saar on Twitter after Trump's press conference. \"The United States has made sure he met the end that terrorists should meet.

    "text": "TEL AVIV: The Israeli Air Force (IAF) may delay the acquisition of a third Lockheed Martin F-35 squadron in favor of a fast purchase of additional new versions of the F-15.\n\nIn recent deliberations within the IAF\u2019s high command, the leading direction was clear \u2013 -priority for the additional F-15\u2019s while delaying the purchase of a third F-35 squadron.\n\nHowever, the head of the IAF\u2019s aircraft department, Col. H., told Breaking Defense that the force will soon face the decision whether to purchase additional F-35s, on top of the 50 that are included in the signed contracts. \u201cWe are very pleased with the performance of the aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nEven before the delivery of the test aircraft the IAF has equipped the first F-35\u2019s with Israeli-developed systems.\n\nSources told Breaking Defense that the rapidly changing situation in the Middle East, especially the Iranian effort to gain more influence in countries like Syria and Lebanon, makes buying F-35\u2019s more urgent. The sources added that the decrease in the price of the F-35 will be a one of the main factors in the expected decision.\n\nAccording to sources close to the issue, while the F-35 can perform best when its stealth feature is essential \u2014 in later phases of combat \u2014 the IAF believes the need is for other aircraft, ones with advanced avionics that can operate in conjunction with the F-35 and carry heavy loads of weapons.\n\nRetired Brig. Gen. Assaf Agmon, who served in the IAF as a fighter pilot and in senior command position and then headed the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies told Breaking Defense that it will be a mistake to delay the acquisition of an additional F-35 squadron.\u201dThe F-35 is not just another aircraft, it brings a total revolution in the interoperability of air, ground and sea sensors \u201d\n\nHe added that even the Americans have not yet learned the full operational capabilities of the F-35 \u201cand what they do know they not always share with us. So we have to learn by ourselves and this is being done everyday\u201d\n\nHe said that it will be a mistake to invest in another platform based on its capability to carry heavy loads of weapons systems: \u201cThe Israeli defense forces have enough ways to use massive fire power against faraway targets\u201d.\n\nAnother retired IAF brigadier general, who asked not to be identified, said that he was against the acquisition of the F-35 from the outset: \u201cThis is a very expensive aircraft that will not really change the capability of the IAF in the coming 20 years.\u201d With the current Israeli defense budget there is no way to create a critical mass buying F-35s. \u201cThis is a niche system that cannot serve as a game changer. The combat now is based on standoff weapon systems, which makes the presence of an aircraft like the F-35 in the fighting area less important,\u201d the retired general said.\n\nThe contrasting views of the two former high ranking IAF officers symbolize the debate within the IAF. The crucial factor may be the senior leadership of the Israeli Defense Forces and Israel\u2019s intelligence community. The scales tip to the opposite direction whenever the intelligence guys present the most imminent threats, and these changes ARE frequent in the unstable Middle East.\n\nIf the IAF decides to purchase additional F-15s, the deal is likely to occur in the middle of the 10 years U.S defense package that was recently approved by Washington. The new package, in effect from 2019, is for $38 billion over 10 years, up from the $31 billion over the last decade.\n\nThe IAF command wants to keep a \u201ccritical mass \u201d of fighter aircraft that can carry a variety of heavy load weapon systems, including some that are being currently developed by the Israeli defense industries .\n\nThe IAF\u2019s F-15D Baz are central to Israeli air power. They operate a number of missions including air superiority, strike, reconnaissance, and command and control and networking \u201cstations\u201d.\n\nIn the meantime, the IAF is continuing to open the envelope of F-35. And the IAF is adding capabilities to the already operational Adir stealth fighters. This even before the delivery of the dedicated test F-35 that will be delivered in 2019.\n\nThe Israeli F-35A, known as the F-35I Adir, recently took part in the attacks on Syrian ground-air systems that followed the downing of an Israeli F-16 by a Syrian ground -air SA-5 missile.\n\nThe IAF refused to be specific but said that the stealth fighter\u2019s capabilities are a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\nIn mid-March, several IAF sources described the F-35 as a \u201csuper intelligence collector\u201d in stealth mode and with the capability to disperse the data to forces in the air and on the ground.\n\nIAF Commander Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin has decided to classify all F-35 operations so as not to give away data an enemy could use to decrease the stealth fighter\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe IAF\u2019s Golden Eagle squadron is currently operating nine F-35\u2019s; this year another six will be delivered."

    "text": "The US State Department has approved the possible sale of 12 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, along with weapons, spares and training, to Nigeria in a contract that could be worth $593 million.\n\nThe US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on 3 August announced that the possible Foreign Military Sale had been approved and Congress had been notified on 2 August.\n\nThe prime contractor is the Sierra Nevada Corporation, headquartered in Centennial, Colorado. The company is building Super Tucanos for the Afghan Air Force and Lebanon at its US facility.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft will support Nigerian military operations against terrorist organizations Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa, and Nigerian efforts to counter illicit trafficking in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d the DSCA said. \u201cThe Super Tucano is a sustainable platform for counterterrorism, counter-insurgency, border surveillance, and illicit trade interdiction operations.\u201d\n\nThe DSCA went on to say in a notification that Nigeria is an important partner in the US national security goal to defeat ISIS, including its branches in Africa, and this sale is part of the US commitment to help Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin countries in that fight. \u201cThe proposed sale, and associated training and engagement, is one piece of broader U.S. security cooperation to help professionalize, modernize, and build the capacity of Nigeria\u2019s armed forces and strengthen the US security relationship with Africa\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d\n\nForeign Military Sale to the Government of Nigeria of twelve (12) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft and weapons, including all associated training, spare parts, aviation and ground support equipment, and hangar, facilities, and infrastructure required to support the program. The estimated total case value is $593 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on August 2, 2017.\n\nThe potential sale will include logistics support, training, spares, ground support equipment and infrastructure. This will include special training on the law of armed conflict and human rights, and air-to-ground integration to minimize civilian harm in air operations.\n\nNigeria has been seeking Super Tucanos since 2015, but concerns by the Obama administration about Nigeria\u2019s human rights record put the deal on hold. When Donald Trump came into office the deal started moving forward, but, according to Defense News, the sale may encounter turbulence.\n\nIn June, US Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying, \u201cWe are concerned that the decision to proceed with this sale will empower the government to backtrack even further on its commitments to human rights, accountability, and upholding international humanitarian law, which in turn could spur greater unrest and violence, particularly in the northeastern part of the country.\u201d\n\nUS Congress may block the sale \u2013 a Congressman earlier this year put on hold a proposed sale to Kenya of armed Air Tractor aircraft due to alleged anti-competitive behaviour by its manufacturers.\n\nEmbraer has recorded a number of orders for its Super Tucano from African countries, which see it as a low cost light attack aircraft that can also be used as a trainer. On the continent, the Super Tucano has been ordered by Angola, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Senegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force may also get second hand Super Tucanos \u2013 in February the Nigerian Air Force announced that Brazilian government had approved the sale of three second hand Super Tucano aircraft to Nigeria."

    "text": "Inside Sweden's plan to mobilize against Russia If you're a NATO member and you're attacked, other members will come to your aid. For nonmember Sweden, this doesn't apply, and so it has plans to mobilize the entire country if attacked by Russia.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 The Swedish military can expect to see a sizable increase in its annual budget regardless of the composition of the new government that will be formed in the wake of parliamentary elections.\n\nAll of the mainstream parties, including the ruling Social Democrats (SDP), the Moderates, the Center, Liberals and the Sweden Democrats\u2019 right-wing nationalist party, campaigned on delivering a stronger national defense and channeling a much higher level of spending to the Swedish Armed Forces over the next 10 years.\n\n\"Sweden needs a more resilient national defense capability that is better funded and resourced,\" said Stefan L\u00f6fven, the SDP\u2019s leader and Sweden\u2019s prime minister.\n\nThe SDP is hoping to assemble a new government in partnership with the Leftist and Green parties. These three parties secured a 40.8 percent share of the popular vote in the recently concluded September 2018 election.\n\nL\u00f6fven\u2019s main challenge is the center-right Alliance group, which includes the Moderates, the Center, Liberals and Christian Democrats. Together, the four Alliance parties won 40.3 percent of the popular vote.\n\nFortress Sweden: Inside the plan to mobilize Swedish society against Russia Sweden is preparing to turn its entire country against an invading force \u2014 and to hold out for three months until help arrives.\n\nThe Alliance is looking to form a new government that excludes both the SDP and the Sweden Democrats.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats raised its share of the popular vote to 17.6 percent. All mainstream parties have ruled out forming a coalition that includes the Sweden Democrats.\n\nDefense will be very much on the minds of Sweden\u2019s new government, against a backdrop of an unpredictable Russia and a domestic military that is unable to either fund major new procurement programs or work within the tight parameters of the current budgeting framework.\n\n\u201cSweden\u2019s national defense has been neglected for decades. What has happened is shameful. The budget allocated to the armed forces must reflect needs, operational realities and the requirement to replace outdated equipment. The goal should be to raise spending on defense to 2 percent of GDP, the recommended NATO level, inside 10 years,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderates and someone being widely tipped to become Sweden\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nThe Alliance supports a more ambitious spending plan for the military that would increase the armed forces' budget by $2.3 billion in the 2019-2021 budgetary period.\n\n\u201cThe [Swedish Armed Forces] needs to be able to afford to run essential equipment-replacement programs. We need more Army brigades, more fighter aircraft, and among other things an increased cyber defense capacity,\u201d Kristersson said.\n\nRestoring the military\u2019s budget and finances to levels that actually reflect the force\u2019s capability requirements will take time. The organization\u2019s budget has been in decline since the Cold War era of 1963, when defense spending amounted to 3.68 percent of Sweden\u2019s gross domestic product. Spending as a ratio of GDP had dropped to 1.1 percent by 2015. It currently stands at about 1.03 percent, a historic low.\n\nInterview: Swedish defense minister details stance on nuclear weapons treaties Sweden is looking to boost its defense posture to deal with Russia's aggressive actions in the region.\n\nA force development plan endorsed by the armed forces favors an increase in annual spending on defense to between $7.36 billion and $9 billion by 2025.\n\nIn the longer term, and by the year 2035, the military would like to see defense spending rise to more than $12.1 billion. At the same time, the Swedish Armed Forces would be strengthened from the current 50,000 personnel of all ranks to 120,000 by the year 2035.\n\nThis proposed new look, improved capability and reinforced organization would comprise at least four brigade-level units, a light infantry special forces regiment, a fleet of 24 surface combat naval vessels and six submarines, eight fighter squadrons, and 120 Gripen combat aircraft.\n\nStefan L\u00f6fven\u2019s SDP-led government adopted new measures in 2017 to increase annual spending on the military from about $4.7 billion to $6.6 billion by 2019.\n\nUnder the spending plan supported by the Alliance, defense expenditure would grow year on year after 2019, reaching $8 billion by 2024.\n\nThe Swedish Armed Forces\u2019 commander in chief, Gen. Micael Byd\u00e9n, has warned the government and the national parliament\u2019s Committee on Defence that the military will be forced to implement \u201cfar-reaching\u201d cost-saving measures if the military fails to secure a substantial increase in its budget after 2019.\n\n\u201cThe government has been updated regarding the true state of our capabilities and finances. We will need to engage in additional and wide-ranging cost savings if there is no real improvement in spending going forward,\u201d Byd\u00e9n said.\n\nAreas provisionally targeted for cost-saving and resource cutbacks by the Swedish Armed Forces include system procurement programs and the Army\u2019s training and exercise operations. Belt-tightening would also likely place greater constraints on the regularity of Air Force flight missions and the Navy\u2019s littoral patrol and ocean water defense activities.\n\nSweden\u2019s purchase of the Raytheon-made Patriot air and missile defense system from the U.S. government emerged as one program that could be negatively impacted by a lack of defense spending.\n\nEstonia eyes mid-range air defense systems to rectify NATO \u2018oversight\u2019 The Baltic region faces a challenge on how to defend its airspace from Russian incursion.\n\nSwedish interest in the Patriot increased after the defense missile system was deployed during the military\u2019s Aurora 17 exercises, held in and around the Swedish Baltic island of Gotland in September 2017.\n\nThe Patriot system, including missile units, will cost Sweden an estimated $1.2 billion. In August, Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told a meeting of the national parliament\u2019s Committee on Defence that Sweden plans to purchase an undisclosed number of missiles at an estimated unit cost of about $5 million.\n\n\u201cThe purchase of the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system is important given the difficult security situation in Sweden\u2019s neighborhood. Rapid technological developments mean that Sweden faces a mix of threats,\u201d said Joakim Lewin, the head of the FMV\u2019s Army Design Office. The FMV is responsible for materiel sourcing and managing military procurement."

Yet, the report said, the military has remained a \u201clargely opaque and unaccountable institution\u201d.\n\nThe average defence budget is estimated to be about $4.4bn, but little is known about where that gets earmarked as it is treated as a state secret.\n\nDuring the past five years, Egypt has become the third largest arms importer in the world, but Lynch said there is little to show in terms of protecting the safety and security of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian people have a military that does everything but keep the country secure,\u201d he said. \u201cIts concern with building its economic and political power has hugely frustrated its efforts to deal with the security challenges it faces in the Sinai and other places.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, several human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have accused members of the Egyptian military of extrajudicial executions in the Sinai, showing \u201cthey fear no oversight or accountability for their actions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a military that may very well be the architect of its own security crisis,\u201d Lynch said.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nTransparency in the face of opacity\n\nAs human rights abuses and state violence in Egypt continue to increase, the report made a series of recommendations for the international community to counter the opacity of the Egyptian military.\n\nIt called for making financial and security assistance dependant on achieving basic levels of transparency and accountability, and to amplify domestic voices advocating for that.\n\nIt also urged better domestic oversight of the armed forces by asking tougher questions on the military\u2019s economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe international community must understand that not only is it doing a major disservice to the people of Egypt by providing support to the armed forces with few strings attached,\u201d Lynch said, \u201cit is also contributing to the security crisis in the country and region.\u201d"

    "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to make it easier to sell small arms abroad.\n\nThe State department has submitted a request to shift oversight on small-arms exports, such as semiautomatic rifles, from State to Commerce, kicking off a 45-day review period of the new policy, which has been long sought by the gun industry.\n\nThe move impacts any firearms that are \u201cwidely available\u201d in U.S. stores for commercial sale. However, State would maintain oversight on any weapons sold primarily for military use.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that arms manufacturers have sought for years, with hopes of selling more weapons abroad \u2013 one that aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s stance that economic security and national security are irrevocably linked.\n\nDo new Trump arms export rules live up to the hype? The Trump administration has a new conventional arms export policy, but it is unclear what has actually changed.\n\nBut while the Trump administration is pushing forward the policy, discussion about moving such weapons to Commerce has been underway for years as part of the Obama administration\u2019s export reform efforts. Under that umbrella, the State department went through the various categories of export rules and looked to move as much as possible over to Commerce, in order to encourage exports and free up State regulators to spend more time on large defense items.\n\n\u201cThese changes will significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition industry, promote American exports, and clarify the regulatory requirements for independent gunsmiths, while at the same time prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related issues may be of concern,\u201d a State department spokesman told Defense News on background.\n\nDuring the 45-day comment period, arms control groups are expected to object over fears such weapons may be used against civilian populations. While State continues to have oversight on military-grade weapons, sales of semiautomatic weapons for police forces would now be outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

In a May 15 statement, he warned that \u201cweakened Congressional oversight of international small arms and munitions sales is extremely hazardous to global security.\u201d"

    "text": "The recent standoff between Ukraine and Russia in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov has put the often-ignored Russian coast guard into the...\n\nThe recent standoff between Ukraine and Russia in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov has put the often-ignored Russian coast guard into the spotlight. Expletive-laden videos in Russian show a coast guard cutter ramming a Ukrainian tug, probably incurring damage in the process.\n\nThe Russian coast guard is an element of the border guard. In an administrative reorganization in 2003, the previously independent border guard was swallowed by the FSB. The FSB succeeded the KGB as a crucial element in internal intelligence, security and control for the Russian state.\n\nHowever, the border guard has a long and illustrious history in Russia, where Border Guard Day is celebrated on May 28. The Russian coast guard is therefore both a law enforcement and a quasi-intelligence organization, although its roots and identity are in maritime law enforcement. The Kerch incident perhaps is a significant gatepost marking the evolution of the Coast Guard after 15 years of control by the FSB.\n\nThe level of working integration between the coast guard and the FSB structure above it remains uncertain, although the Kerch incident suggests a high level of control. In addition, air support for this operation likely came from military units, demonstrating further operational coordination between FSB and the military.\n\nThese aspects of the Kerch incident are interesting for both the potential future uses of the Russian Coast Guard for aggressive gray zone operations, and for questions about the United States and NATO countries\u2019 engagements with the Russian coast guard.\n\nThe Kerch Strait operation reflects a new use of the Russian coast guard, more akin to Chinese or Iranian use of paramilitary and constabulary maritime forces and \u201clawfare.\u201d As recently described by my colleague Conor Kennedy, China has been using its coast guard and maritime militia with great effectiveness to assert presence, conduct harassment and sabotage, escort and provide a pretext for defensive military action, and gather intelligence.\n\nWhile harassment of U.S. Navy warships by Iranian small boats that are military lies firmly within mil-mil guidelines, using constabulary forces changes the dynamics of the use of force. Similar to Chinese use of nonmilitary coast guard and maritime militia to accomplish strategic objectives while maintaining \u201cplausible deniability\u201d and avoiding escalatory dynamics, Moscow may have deliberately chosen to use the Russian Coast Guard to act in the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe use of the Russian Federation Navy to close the strait would have been more likely to escalate because it would have been a military-on-military clash. In contrast, using the Russian coast guard made it a law enforcement issue rather than a military-sanctioned act of war. Russia is adept at using legal channels to pursue violations of justice. It now appears willing to use its coast guard for this purpose.\n\nOnshore, the situation in eastern Ukraine has been stuck in a rut. Perhaps the escalation in the Sea of Azov was seen by the Russians as a means to break the impasse, using the flimsy legal cover provided by the coast guard. No similar terrestrial options exist, as the Russians have exhausted their plausible deniability for operations by police, volunteers and undercover \u201clittle green men.\u201d\n\nWhile Russian seizure of the Azov coast was anticipated, it was not expected to use its coast guard. Utilizing the Russian coast guard in this way opens a new range of options for Moscow, in the Sea of Azov and beyond.\n\nAbove \u2014 the Russian coast guard Project 97P vessel Volga. Photo via Wikipedia. At top \u2014 a Russian tug rams a Ukrainian navy boat as a Russian coast guard vessel stands by on Nov. 25, 2018. Ukrainian ministry of defense photo\n\nAbove \u2014 the Russian coast guard Project 97P vessel. Photo via Wikipedia. At top \u2014 a Russian tug rams a Ukrainian navy boat as a Russian coast guard vessel stands by on Nov. 25, 2018. Ukrainian ministry of defense photo\n\nAdditional motivation to launch a coast guard operation, rather than using Russian navy ships, may come from the recent accident involving Russia\u2019s PD-50 floating dry dock in Severodvinsk. The carry-on effects of losing that dry dock must be rippling through operational plans for the Black Sea Fleet. If the PD-50 accident is hastening the \u201cgreen water\u201d evolution of the Russian navy, a growing role and closer coordination with the coast guard is a logical step.\n\nBringing the Russian coast guard into play may provide additional operational flexibility depth, in addition to range.\n\nAs it has tested different tactics in Syria and Ukraine, Russia could be evaluating the use of the Russian coast guard for action elsewhere. Where else might Russia deploy its coast guard in aggressive ways? On conceivable option would be against Norway in Svalbard, a demilitarized island group under Norwegian sovereignty adjacent to important Barents Sea fisheries.\n\nWith a substantial Russian population on Svalbard, there has been increasing speculation that Russia may launch gray zone operations there. However, the Norwegian and Russian navies and coast guards have a fairly effective working relationship and Russia could be far less confident in the outcome.\n\nDespite the loss of a frigate, Norway\u2019s confidence and modern naval and air capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis Russia are far beyond Ukraine\u2019s. Moreover, the strategic calculus for Moscow in Svalbard is far riskier.\n\nCoast guards are one of the last remaining effective areas of cooperation among NATO countries and Russia. The coast guards of the United States, Canada and Norway all engage with their Russian counterparts on soft security issues including fisheries enforcement, oil spill response and search and rescue operations.\n\nBilaterally, U.S. and Russian coast guards cooperate on fisheries enforcement in the Bering Sea and North Pacific across the shared maritime border. Therefore the Kerch incident will pose a challenging question about further cooperation between coast guards. One avenue of response may be to limit engagement by NATO countries\u2019 coast guards with the Russian coast guard.\n\nMoscow\u2019s bold new deployment of the Russian coast guard this week puts further pressure on the strategy of isolation the United States and its allies are pursuing against Russia. It is also a troubling sign of future directions for Russian unconventional operations, and an indication of closer ties between the RCG and Russian Federation Navy.\n\nThe recordings released by the Ukrainian General Staff, which in fact might be intercepted Russian coast guard communications, include comments that Adm. Gennady Medvedev, head of the border guard, is \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201cthe president is in control of all that.\u201d Medvedev may be apprehensive about his suddenly expanding role in the Russian constellation of aggression.\n\nThe views presented here are the author\u2019s own, and do not represent the views of the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Naval War College, where the author is an instructor."

    "text": "The Kenyan Police Air Wing has taken delivery of a Mil Mi-17V-5 multi-role helicopter from Russian Helicopters as it forges ahead with a force modernisation exercise that includes the acquisition of new aircraft for the Police Air Wing.\n\nThe helicopter was handed over to Kenyan Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery by Alexander Shcherbinin, Russian Helicopters Deputy Director General for Marketing and Business Development in a ceremony held at the Wilson Airport in Nairobi on 29 March.\n\nThe aircraft was manufacture by Russian Helicopters subsidiary Kazan Helicopter Plant. Nkaissery hailed the delivery of the helicopter as a boost to the Police Air Wing, which now has three operational Mi-17 rotorcraft.\n\nHe said with the new aircraft, the air wing would be able to conduct counter-terrorism operations and respond to other policing needs in remote parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe capacity and ability of the Police Air Wing has tremendously improved in the last four years under the National Police Service modernisation programme, of which the helicopter acquisition project is part.\n\n\u201cToday we launched a long-range helicopter with the capacity to carry 36 fully-equipped security officers and an airborne endurance of up to about four hours depending on various factors including the weather,\u201d Nkaissery said.\n\nShcherbinin said by opting for the Mi-17V-5, Kenya had joined a growing African customer base which now operates more than 700 products of the Russian Helicopters conglomerate.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully fulfilled the contract to supply our first helicopter to Kenya. Currently, the total fleet of Russian-made helicopters in the African countries exceeds 700, and it requires a gradual upgrade.\n\n\u201cRussian helicopters have shown good results in performing the widest range of tasks in Africa. We hope for further and fruitful cooperation,\u201d he said. In terms of the contract, the company has also started training some local aircraft assembly and maintenance specialists.\n\nThe company is expected to deliver another Mi-17V-5 helicopter to the Kenyan police service before the end of April. At least five helicopter pilots have been trained to operate the helicopters.\n\nAccording to Russian Helicopters, the Mi-8/17 type helicopters offered to African clients are intended primarily for use in civil aviation, to transport cargo and passengers including VIPs.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two Klimov VK-2500PS-03 turboshaft engines of 2,400 hp each giving a cruising speed of 260 km/h, a maximum speed of 280 km/h and a range of 800 km. It has a service ceiling of 6 000 m.\n\nThe Kenya Police Air Wing lost an AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter in a crash in September 2016. It was damaged beyond repair and written off after the accident. The delivery of the Mi-17 partially offsets this, and other helicopter losses by the Air wing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kenyan National Police Service has also taken delivery of 43 Toyota Landcruiser 4X4 patrol vehicles in single-cab configuration. The vehicles were donated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and they will be used for policing operations in and around the Dadab and Kakuma refugee camps.\n\nThe Dadab camp, which is home to thousands of war-refugees from neighbouring Somalia, is set to be closed by the Kenyan government which claims to have intelligence reports indicating that it was a breeding ground for some of the militants who were involved in terrorist acts in the last few years.\n\nThe vehicles were handed over to Kenyan Police Inspector-General Joseph Boinnet by UNHCR country representative Raouf Mazou in Nairobi on 28 March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoinnet said with the vehicles as a force multiplier, police would work to ensure the security of the refugee camps. Some of the vehicles will be deployed to counter-terrorism operations in the north-east of the country."

(Long-term plans call for at least 18 multi-role helicopters to replace Soviet-designed Mi-17 rotorcraft, though no platform has been selected as yet.)\n\n\u201cBy replacing them, we are also cutting those ties with Russia,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, adding that Slovakia will fly the UH-60 and Mi-17 for several years while the UH-60 is phased in.\n\nSlovakia was a part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War but joined the European Union and the NATO military alliance in 2004.\n\nSlovakian officials understand the purchase of American hardware strengthens their strategic relationship, but Ondrejcs\u00e1k emphasized \u2014 on the anniversary of Czechoslovakia\u2019s velvet revolution in 1989 \u2014 the partnership is based on faith in liberal democratic values.\n\n\u201cWe want to see America as a leader in the free world, as they did for 70 years,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said. \u201cWe hear a lot here [at Halifax] about the values-based international order, but it\u2019s very real for us.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Both have moved to increase their respective defense budgets following Russia\u2019s alleged military intervention in Ukraine\u2019s eastern part and its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nAs to the F-16s, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said the intent is for his government to finalize the legislative vehicle and contract in the coming months to ensure timely delivery of the first F-16s in 2022 or 2023.\n\nIn part driven by maintenance costs, Slovakia decided to make a switch from the MiG-29 and ultimately chose the F-16V over the Saab Gripen based on price and internal analysis, according to Ondrejcs\u00e1k.\n\nThe announcement came in July after U.S. State Department in April approved the potential sale of 14 Block 70/72 F-16Vs for Slovakia.\n\nOtherwise, negotiations are also underway for the U.S. to further improve Slovakian air fields in Slia\u010d, which is in central Slovakia and in Malacky, which is in in Western Slovakia.\n\n\u201cWe take it as a win-win situation because they are investing in infrastructure, which will be crucial for us too,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said of the U.S. military. \u201cOf course its good for them (the U.S. military) because in case of potential operations, they (the airfields) are available.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has ramped up investments that would enable it to deploy to allied bases in Eastern Europe and operate close to Russia\u2019s western flank. U.S. air field improvements have already included partner air bases in Hungary, Estonia and elsewhere.\n\nAs Slovakia upgrades its heavy mechanized units, it is also exploring the modernization of its existing fleet of T-72 main battle tanks, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, rather than wait for the next generation of MBT to be developed. No platform has been selected."

    "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 More than two decades after the program was officially launched, Turkey has signed a contract for the serial production of the country\u2019s first indigenous, new-generation main battle tank, the Altay.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar contract was signed Nov. 9 between Turkey\u2019s defense procurement authority, the Defence Industry Executive of the Presidency (or SSB, formerly SSM) and Turkish-Qatari armored vehicles manufacturer BMC, which has close links to Turkey\u2019s ruling party. Officials did not reveal the contract price.\n\nThe contract involves the production of an initial batch of 250 units, life cycle logistical support, and the establishment by the contractor of a tank systems technology center and its operation. As part of the contract, BMC will also design, develop and produce a tank with an unmanned fire control unit.\n\nThe first Altay tank will roll off the assembly line within 18 months, according to the contract.\n\nAccording to Ahmet Raci Yal\u00e7\u0131n, head of the land vehicles department at SSB, the Altay program will materialize in two phases: T1 and T2. T1 covers the first 250 units, he said, and the T2 phase will involve the advanced version of the Altay.\n\nIsmail Demir, the head of SSB, said: \u201cThis contract is the joint work of the parties (SSB and BMC) for the optimal production of a cost-efficient tank.\u201d He added that the Turkish government has not ruled out partnerships, cooperation and support with and from foreign entities.\n\nAfter Turkey\u2019s election, is it (defense) business as usual? Turkey's president is widely known for his ambitions in indigenous defense and aerospace capabilities in line with his efforts to increase Turkey\u2019s regional and global political clout.\n\nHe also noted that the government expects BMC to deliver unmanned armored vehicles solutions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nDespite plans for the Altay to be the \u201cbest tank in the world\u201d (in the words of BMC Chairman Ethem Sancak), industry sources and experts are questioning the program\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cNo one knows if, as originally planned, the Altay would be powered by a German-made engine (from MTU) and a German-made transmission mechanism,\u201d one source said. \u201cThere are big questions marks about the armor and the active protection system. \u2026 And of course, if the Altay will feature German know-how, will it be on the market with German export licenses, or restricted for sales abroad, or even deployed for certain sensitive missions like in Syria or Iraq?\u201d\n\nDemir, however, is confident Turkey \u201cwill not allow any restrictions\u201d in regard to indigenous programs with foreign know-how, including the engine. In other words: BMC will use foreign engines in the first Altay tanks due to \u201ctime limitations,\u201d but ultimately Turkey wants to maximize locally made parts for its indigenous programs.\n\nIn terms of where this foreign technology will come from, A London-based defense expert noted that a potential German blockade could mean \u201cBMC will not have too many options and may have to go non-NATO, like Russia or Ukraine.\u201d Such a move would be the second major defense contract that Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 would sign with a non-NATO country, after the government\u2019s decision to acquire and deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense system.\n\nSecurity experts say Turkey\u2019s regional rivals, as well as state and nonstate entities Turkey views as security threats, are closely watching the Altay\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cThe future pace of the Altay program and potential technological and financial snags it may face will be watched closely by Greece, Syria, Iraq and, to a lesser degree, by Russia,\u201d said Ahmet Do\u011fan, vice president of the Ankara-based think tank Sigma.\n\nCurrency crisis risks Turkish defense programs Turkey\u2019s defense and procurement planners are worried the plunge of the national currency could expose foreign currency-related weapons programs to the risk of major delays or suspension.\n\nIn April, the procurement authority SSB, then SSM, announced that it selected BMC as the winner of the Altay contract. BMC defeated Otokar, an armored vehicles producer that built the Altay\u2019s prototype, and FNSS, another privately owned armored vehicles maker.\n\nIn 2008, Otokar, Turkey\u2019s largest privately owned defense company, signed a $500 million contract with SSM for the development and production of four prototypes of the Altay. The prototype contract did not involve serial production.\n\nBMC is a partnership between a Qatari investment fund and a Turkish venture, whose partner, Sancak, also sat on the executive board of Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party."

Some rights reserved.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Open Caucasus Media. We are grateful for their permission to republish it here.\n\nFor three decades the border between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan has echoed with the crack of gunfire: the ceaseless noise of the oldest \u2018frozen conflict\u2019 in the former USSR. Yet for those living in Nagorno-Karabakh since the ceasefire of 1994 was signed, this border has seemed to drift further and further away, almost vanishing from the horizon of relevance.\n\nGegham Baghdasaryan, the head of the Karabakh Press Club, illustrated this in an anecdote: at an international conference years ago, a young Armenian woman from Karabakh was called to the floor. She was asked about the relationship between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. She replied, \u201cwhat is my relationship to Azerbaijan? I don\u2019t have a relationship. I just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\nThis opinion was far from unique, and was echoed by many in Karabakh. One respondent, a young man in his mid-twenties, said that the events of April \u201copened his eyes\u201d to the \u201creal danger\u201d that Azerbaijan presented. For him and for other young people, the ceasefire had been all they had ever known, and for all the bellicose rhetoric and the slow but constant deaths on the border, it had become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky.\n\nThe ceasefire is all Karabakh\u2019s youth have ever known. Bellicose rhetoric and deaths on the border have become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky\n\nSince the clashes of April 2016 \u2014 four days during which fierce fighting erupted along the line of contact, and ended with over a hundred fatalities, and the seizure by Azerbaijan of several key positions formerly controlled by Armenian forces \u2014 the conflict has taken on a shrill immediacy. The shock which initially gripped the population of Karabakh transformed into anger both at Azerbaijan and at the loss of a sense of normality.\n\nA few years ago, flare-ups in the prolonged conflict might have been seen both by residents and politicians as exceptional, but this most recent violent eruption seems to have solidified in their minds a sense that rather than an exception, war is in fact, the normal state of affairs, and that military interests must circumscribe and submerge all other pursuits.\n\nThe Karabakh war lasted from 1988\u20131994. It claimed over 30,000 lives, displaced almost a million people, and utterly devastated Karabakh\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The region suffered an estimated $5 billion in damage (with a population of only 140,000) \u2014 further compounded by the deindustrialisation that followed the USSR\u2019s collapse.\n\nNevertheless, Nagorno-Karabakh endured. With generous aid from the Republic of Armenia as well as donations from the global Armenian diaspora, Nagorno-Karabakh was rebuilt. By 2007 it had the fastest growing economy in the wider region, with GDP growth rates fluctuating between 10%\u201315% per year. Moreover, unlike Armenia, it did not suffer from demographic decline, with the population increasing by 10% since 2005.\n\nThis quite literal \u201crise from the ashes\u201d is most apparent in Karabakh\u2019s capital, Stepanakert. Formerly a bombed-out city with more than a passing resemblance to post-war Sarajevo, it has in recent years developed into a small yet bustling urban centre, featuring well-paved boulevards, neatly maintained gardens, and a wealth of public amenities.\n\nThe Caucasian tiger\n\n\u2018At first [Karabakh\u2019s economic development] was a patriotic undertaking\u2019, Davit Babayan, speaker for the office of the President of Nagorno-Karabakh, told OC Media. \u2018But that cannot work forever\u2019. He argues that Karabakh\u2019s economic motor for the past decade was a commitment to a \u2018market-driven\u2019 economy, and that only by creating \u2018special conditions for investment\u2019 would Karabakh\u2019s development continue.\n\nOfficially, Nagorno-Karabakh has been on an explicitly market-oriented path since 2007, when under the official direction of its newly elected President Bako Sahayan, it undertook rapid (neo)liberal economic reforms. Examples of this include: the dissolution of the anti-monopoly service (under the slogan \u201cThe Market Will Figure It Out\u201d), the creation of a flat-tax for those categorised as self-employed ($15 a month), and the reduction of regulations on construction licenses (officially it should take only three days for a new license to be approved). The reforms also entailed the privatisation of a series of state-owned assets, most significantly, the regional hydropower utility.\n\nMuch like the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, this \u201cCaucasian Tiger\u201d is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance\n\nConsidered in conjunction with Karabakh\u2019s stellar rates of economic growth, these reforms drew praise from liberal voices in the wider region, with some even calling the region \u201cThe Caucasian Tiger\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a similar vein to the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, Karabakh is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance. Karabakh\u2019s rapid development has been made possible only through significant government intervention in the market and perhaps more importantly, ongoing transfers of funds from the Republic of Armenia. This state of affairs is only made possible through Karabakh\u2019s unique geopolitical and ideological position.\n\nArmenia\u2019s heart\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is without question the single most volatile factor in Armenia\u2019s politics. It is not simply a place, but an idea. It stands in for Armenian nationhood, and in a country where the Armenian Genocide of 1915 still defines foreign policy, it provides a powerful counter-narrative to a sense of historical victimhood. As Karabakh politician Karen Avagimyan told OC Media, Karabakh is \u201cthe spiritual heart of Armenia\u201d.\n\nA banner in central Stepanakert. Photo (c): Khachig Joukhajian / OC Media. All rights reserved.In practical terms this means that if any significant amount of territory in Karabakh is re-taken by Azerbaijan, the government in Yerevan would likely not survive. For instance, in the summer of 2016 a group of Karabakh veterans calling themselves the Sasna Tsrer (the Daredevils of Sasun) seized a police station and called for an uprising against the government. Central to their criticisms of the government was their claim that the current administration intended to cede part of Karabakh to Azerbaijan. While the claim seems to have been spurious, at the time, it helped to mobilise thousands of young people who met with police in violent clashes in defence of the Sasna Tsrer.\n\nThe policies of the Armenian Government towards Karabakh, and the policies of the Karabakh government itself, must be understood in the light of such events. Karabakh\u2019s territorial integrity must be maintained, and all economic and social policies must account for and support this objective.\n\nIn Karabakh, where economic emigration is seen as a threat to national security, neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option\n\nAs Nagorno-Karabakh is an unrecognised state, it is therefore not party to most international trade-treaties. This means the government needs to maintain an investment friendly atmosphere and to advertise this friendliness, if \u201cnon-patriotic\u201d investment (coming primarily from the Russian Federation) is to continue. However, this creates a certain conundrum for the ruling authorities. Investor-friendly and deregulated markets often foster grave societal inequality, with less competitive local workers and small businesses being crushed by economies of scale. As in much of the world, poverty easily transforms into migration, which while quite tolerable for most governments, in Karabakh is simply a non-starter.\n\nIn the eyes of Karabakh officials, the equation of migration is simple: migration equals a lower population, a lower population means fewer soldiers, and fewer soldiers not only makes Karabakh militarily weaker but also incentivises Azerbaijan to attack. This means that the economy cannot be subject to the whims of a capricious market, as population fluctuation resulting from periodic economic crises would quite literally endanger Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option.\n\nMilitarised social democracy\n\nIn practice, the collection of policies enacted to ensure economic stability and liveability in Nagorno-Karabakh can be considered a sort of militarised social democracy: welfare mechanisms are in place to lessen the impact of unemployment or poverty, but they differ from traditional European social democracy in that these mechanisms are tied explicitly to military status.\n\nFor instance, a large portion of the population sits on military pensions, and the families of soldiers killed or wounded on the front are not only financially supported, but often granted free housing or other essentials and amenities. The state also insures all residents who live close to the line of contact, with any damage from the conflict (such as homes damaged by shelling or cattle killed by gunfire) covered by the state.\n\nMarket in Stepanakert, 2012. Photo CC BY-NC-ND 2.0: Marco Fieber / Flickr. Some rights reserved.That\u2019s not to say the government doesn\u2019t make use of traditional Keynesian policy either. In fact, the state often intervenes at the level of the firm, providing subsidies and preferential loans to struggling businesses, keeping them afloat to ensure that a higher level of employment is maintained.\n\nIt may seem like this is a little much for a government presiding over a relatively poor population of 146,000 to accomplish, and that\u2019s because it is. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh is far from self-sufficient. Officially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated for the region, though the real number is likely far higher, especially since any budget transfers related to national defence are classified.\n\nOfficially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated to Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 though the real amount is probably much higher\n\nThis policy direction has only solidified since the April clashes. Villages near the line of contact have become subject to new legislative classification as \u201cborder villages\u201d. Here, according to Speaker of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Artak Beglaryan, the government\u2019s explicit purpose is to maintain, and if possible, increase the population in order to create a presence that would detect and deter Azerbaijani attacks. This is a difficult task, as these villages are directly in the line of fire \u2014 an understandable disincentive for citizens to continue living there.\n\nWhich is why under the auspices of this new legislation the government has increased subsidies for these villages \u2014 for instance, creating a gas and electricity subsidy that, for some households, entirely covers their monthly bills \u2014 as well as providing financial incentives (again subsidies, as well as tax breaks) for investment in border villages in order to stimulate employment.\n\nBut the lengths to which the government is willing to leave behind neoliberal economic orthodoxy is most apparent in the village most affected by the conflict: Talish.\n\nA kolkhoz by any other name\n\nIn the dawn hours of 2 April 2016, the north-western heights above the small village of 500 were overrun by the Azerbaijani military. By the time Armenian forces retook Talish, it had been reduced to rubble, and even after the ceasefire was signed, the strategic hills overlooking the village remained in Azerbaijani hands.\n\nWith most of the homes destroyed, the people of Talish have become homeless, living with relatives or in state-provided housing in nearby villages further away from the line of contact. However, even in its current strategically vulnerable position, the Karabakh government is committed to rebuilding Talish, and having its residents return.\n\nArmenian militia in Talish, a village in the Martakert region of the self-declared Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, April 2016. Photo (c): RIA Novosti. All rights reserved.Every single family that lost a home will have their home rebuilt. Infrastructure will be repaired and updated. New buildings will also be added, including a house of culture and a recreation centre. But these are not the most ambitious plans for the village; in order to ensure a high level of employment and a strong degree of social solidarity, the village is rebuilding its agricultural and production capacities in a collective model.\n\nIn the words of Talish Mayor Vilen Petrosyan, \u201cIt will be like a Soviet kolkhoz (collective farm - ed.), but different. Instead of giving our profits to the government, the community will decide what to do with them\u201d. The beginnings of this new/old model are already in place. The Talish \u2018collective\u2019 is producing honey, fruit and vegetables, spirits, meat, and dairy \u2014 with several dozen workers employed by the social enterprise composed of former Talish residents (entirely men) who have returned to the village as government contractors, working to rebuild their homes and defend them in case of an attack.\n\nWhether the model will work, and if it will actually be democratic, remains to be seen. But for the local administration, the hope is that the new Talish will not only flourish, but become a model of economy and governance for other villages in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nGoing nowhere\n\nFrom 1994 onwards, the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh have been holding out hope for a peaceful normalisation of their situation. But as repeated peace deals floundered, and a deep chill descended, many began to adapt to a new status quo. Even if peace never came, life would go on. But the events of April 2016 shattered this uneasy sense of stability.\n\nIn a strange irony however, as the Karabakh people\u2019s sense of stability was shattered, the existing economic and political order only grew stronger. As a region forged in the crucible of conflict and still enduring its ravages almost thirty years later, Nagorno-Karabakh has ceased being a place where the military exists to support state and society. Rather state and society now exist to support the military. And that is unlikely to change any time soon."

    "text": "The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is well-positioned for the future as it takes a long-term perspective in its planning.\n\nThis includes studying the latest-generation F-35 fighter jets and investing in advanced unmanned aerial vehicles, said Chief of Air Force Mervyn Tan.\n\nAs a small nation facing a future fraught with uncertainty and challenges, the commitment, dedication and resilience of RSAF's people will continue to play a critical role in safeguarding Singapore's sovereignty, he added.\n\nIn an e-mail interview released on Sunday ahead of the Singapore Airshow 2018, Major-General Tan gave his views on topics relating to the air force's 50th anniversary this year, future challenges and plans. The year-long celebrations will be launched tomorrow at the Airshow, where President Halimah Yacob will unveil an F-15SG fighter jet painted in RSAF50 colours.\n\nMG Tan said: \"The RSAF has always taken a long-term perspective in our planning. This approach has allowed us to invest in capabilities that not only meet our near-term defence needs, but also enable us to address evolving threats.\"\n\nOne example is the investment in advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs enhance the Singapore military's \"battlefield awareness as well as security agencies' ground situation awareness to better orchestrate responses for homeland security operations\", said MG Tan, who took over as air force chief in March 2016.\n\nWith the F-5s retired after reaching the end of their operational lifespan, the air force has upgraded its F-16s and is evaluating the F-35 as an option to further modernise the fighter fleet and maintain its combat edge, he said. \"This is to ensure that we continue to have a capable fighter fleet to defend Singapore's sovereignty and interests into the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe F-35B will be in Singapore for the first time at the biennial Airshow, which takes place from Feb 6 to 11 this year. The fifth-generation fighter aircraft has been developed by United States defence company Lockheed Martin.\n\nEmphasising the importance of the air force to Singapore as a small nation, MG Tan said airmen and women are trained to perform a wide spectrum of peacetime operations, such as humanitarian and disaster relief missions, besides defending Singapore's sovereignty.\n\nThe instances when the RSAF has responded to the call of duty include rescuing stranded passengers during the 1983 cable car disaster, participating in counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and contributing to the Defeat ISIS Coalition in the Middle East, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the air force has overcome challenges such as training in Singapore's \"small and congested airspace\". This was done by conducting some training overseas and using simulators.\n\nMG Tan also pointed to the RSAF's people as its greatest strength. \"It is their professionalism, commitment and resilience that will enable us to achieve mission success,\" he said.\n\n\"With this firm foundation, I am confident that the RSAF will continue to be the deterrent, dependable and dominant force that is capable of defending Singapore's sovereignty and interests, and fly our flag high into the future.\""

Subsequently, Airbus will promote the aircraft to North American operators.\"During its tour, the C295 will demonstrate its advanced ISR capabilities as well as the platform's versatility and suitability for potential operators, especially in the Asian region,\" Airbus said. The company is also promoting the aircraft to meet regional requirements to enhance surveillance, search and rescue, transport, medical evacuation, and humanitarian missions.Airbus said the aircraft on display in Thailand is a model of the platform recently delivered to the Brazilian Air Force to meet its search and rescue and maritime patrol requirements.Airbus said it sees opportunities to supply the aircraft to the RTN, which is expected in the coming years to replace its ageing fleets of Dornier 228 and Fokker F27 Friendship patrol craft, which were acquired from the 1980s onwards.In addition, Airbus said it is seeking to expand sales of the C295 military transport aircraft to the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) took delivery in June 2016 of a single C295W transport aircraft, although it is understood that the service requires three additional platforms."

The crash was listed as the worst accident in Myanmar Air Force history.\n\n\n\nA military helicopter crashed in central Myanmar, killing three military personnel on board in June 2016.\n\n\n\nFive military personnel were killed in February 2016 after an air force aircraft crashed in the country\u2019s capital, Naypyitaw, according to media reports.\n\n\n\nTopics: Accident, Military\n\n\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\nYes he was a brave pilot. Based on the location and the coordinates of his plane's path, some say he steered the ill fated plane from hitting villages. Which is why the plane was found in a paddy field. So he couldn't deploy his parachute in time and they had to drag his body from the water. I hope they give him a proper funeral. Thanks for your contribution here and helping us stay updated bro"

Half will go to Poland's special forces and the remainder to the Navy.\n\nThe aircraft will include two Black Hawk helos, and the remaining 14 will be selected among offers that were submitted by Lockheed Martin, Leonardo and Airbus Helicopters, Antoni Macierewicz told local news outlet Polish Press Agency.\n\n\"I was told that [the two Black Hawks] will be delivered this March,\" Macierewicz said. \"All the paperwork had to be consulted across the Atlantic. This significantly delayed the procedure.\"\n\nThe aircraft will replace Poland's Soviet-designed Mil Mi-8, Mi-14 and Mi-17 helicopters.\n\nLast year, the government announced that it ended negotiations over a potential acquisition of 50 Caracal helos from Airbus under a deal worth about 13.5 billion zloty (U.S. $3.3 billion). The helo tender was relaunched shortly after this, and the ministry accepted new offers by Lockheed Martin, Airbus Helicopters and Leonardo.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Hawk is produced by Lockheed Martin's Polish subsidiary PZL Mielec, and Leonardo's Polish offshoot PZL Swidnik, which makes the AW149 helicopter.\n\n\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?
