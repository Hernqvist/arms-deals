Namibian President Hage Geingob on Friday commissioned two Chinese-built naval vessels at the harbor town of Walvis Bay. (Xinhua/Wu Changwei)\n\nWALVIS BAY, Namibia, Oct. 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Hage Geingob on Friday commissioned two state-of-the-art Chinese-built naval vessels at the harbor town of Walvis Bay.\n\nThe two submarine chasers, Brukkaros and Daures, boast surface and undersurface targets attacking capabilities.\n\nThey were donated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and arrived in Namibian waters in August.\n\nThe Namibian president thanked China for its assistance to the southwestern African country in protecting its territory and maritime resources.\n\n\"The delivery and incorporation of the two submarine chasers into our naval fleet will add tremendous value to Namibia's naval combat surface and under-surface capability, as well as augment the country's maritime patrol and surveillance capability,\" Geingob said.\n\n\"Our maritime economy is a major contributor to job creation and economic growth. Given our large coastline, the Navy faces a huge challenge in ensuring that it protects the country against any and all maritime threats. It is therefore of paramount importance that we continue to increase our naval capabilities.\"\n\nGeingob also thanked China for being an all-weather friend, adding that it is better to have one loyal friend than a hundred fair-weather friends."

    "text": "Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody has sold L-39NG jets to Senegal, which are configured for light attack and training.\n\nAero Vodochody on 4 April said the President of Senegal, Macky Sall, during national Independence Day celebrations, announced the purchase of the four L-39NGs.\n\nThe contract will also cover the training of pilots, including conversion, instructor and combat training, maintenance personnel training, spare parts, ground support equipment and logistic support services.\n\nSenegal\u2019s air force has few fixed wing combat aircraft, its most significant purchase being Super Tucanos in 2013. It has several Mi-35P Hind attack helicopters in service.\n\n\u201cThe L-39NG aircraft is the new future of Aero Vodochody, the company that has been producing proprietary aircraft since 1919. The L-39NG is based on successful aero dynamical concept of the current L-39, but is manufactured with the use of new technologies and contains modern systems,\u201d said Giuseppe Giordo, the president of Aero Vodochody. \u201cCurrently we also have two additional contracts in a very mature state of negotiation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn January, Aero started up the L-39NG pre-series production line. Aero is currently producing a total of four L-39NGs. The first and the fourth aircraft will be used for flight tests, the second one for static tests and the third for fatigue tests. The first flight of the new pre-series L-39NG is planned to happen at the end of 2018 with deliveries expected to start in early 2020. Full scale production is expected by 2022 with 16 units a year.\n\nThe L-39NG programme started in 2014. The aircraft is powered by a single Williams FJ44-4M engine with FADEC control and has five hardpoints for 1 200 kg of weapons (three more than previously). Other changes compared to the standard L-39 are wet wings without wingtip tanks, it has a 15 000 flight hour service life, lighter and stronger airframe and Health and Usage Monitoring System. The L-39NG uses 50% new parts and 50% parts taken from the existing L-39.\n\nAero Vodochody said that, after focussing on aerostructures, the Senegalese L-39NG sale represents the first international sale of new aircraft in 20 years.\n\nThe sale of the light attack version of the aircraft is the first of a series the company is seeking to close abroad after bringing in industry veteran Giuseppe Giordo as president in 2016 to help turn the company around.\n\nDuring the last days of the Cold War in 1988, Aero Vodochody\u2019s factory outside Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia produced a 250 of its Albatros L-39 training jets for Soviet bloc air forces.\n\nThose customers disappeared with the collapse of Communism as successive governments focused on building a market economy and steered away from arms exports, sending the industry into a tailspin. Numerous comeback attempts sputtered for Aero, which halted jet production between 2003 and 2015.\n\nBoeing bought a stake in Aero in the 1990s but sold it back to the government after failing to land new contracts. Czech-Slovak private equity group Penta bought Aero in 2006.\n\nGiordo has overseen the relaunch of the L-159 and has championed the next generation L-39 trainer. It aims to produce up to 26 aircraft annually over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nIn recent years, Aero sold its L-159 light combat aircraft to the Iraq Air Force and US aviation services company Draken International. Those aircraft were originally made for the Czech military in the early 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-series production L-39NGs will be delivered to the launch customer, Czech state-owned company LOM Praha. Besides LOM Praha, the L-39NG is also being acquired by the Breitling Jet Team and Draken International\u2019s Black Diamond Jet Team."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nThe budget allocated is far short of the money the IAF has committed to pay for purchasing aircraft. It will need a mid-year bail out.\n\nNew Delhi: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has projected that it may not be able to make tranche payments (akin to EMIs) for its past purchases in fiscal 2018-19, as adequate resources haven\u2019t been allotted by the finance ministry.\n\nThe projection underlines the crisis that an increasingly lopsided defence budget has brought to the defence services.\n\nThe IAF has been allocated Rs 35,755 crore for the next fiscal year, a sum that top officials say falls well short of the amount it has to pay for purchases made in the past few years, including for systems such as the Rafale fighter jets, Apache attack choppers and Chinook heavy lift helicopters.\n\nAll these aircraft are to be delivered by 2019-2020, but part payments need to be made every year as they go through the production cycle in France and the US, and training and associated activities commence from the Indian side.\n\nWith the allocated budget short of its committed liabilities, the IAF will need to apply for special budgetary sanctions mid-year, throwing its financial planning out of gear. Sources said that the Air Force could be short by as much as Rs 14,000 crore, but that special provisions will be made later in the year to ensure that all commitments are honoured.\n\nEmpty pockets\n\nSenior officials say that while every year the allocated budget is far short of what the services project as expenses, this is the first time in recent memory that it will fall short of the \u2018compulsory payments\u2019 that need to be made.\n\nIn 2017-18 for example, official records show that the IAF requested the finance ministry for Rs 62,049 crore under the capital head, as it had planned to make payments for the Rafale fighter jets and associated components. However, given financial constraints, the service was allotted just 54 per cent of this sum (Rs 33,570 crore).\n\nAs reported by ThePrint, the Indian defence budget is now dangerously skewed as the revenue bill has zoomed over the years. The sustained manpower-intensive nature of the services has resulted in a situation where resources available for modernisation of the forces are far outstripped by the allocations required for paying salaries and pensions to soldiers.\n\nReports of the parliamentary standing committee on defence show a steady decline in the capital budget of the defence ministry. From 2007, when the ministry spent 41 per cent of its money on capital expenses, the ratio was down to 32 per cent in 2016-17.\n\nA shrinking capital budget means that the money available to initiate new purchases has reduced \u2013 in the case of the Army, for example, the money available for new purchases in 2016-17 was Rs 2,080 crore, or just 14 per cent of its total capital share.\n\nWhat can be done to fix this?\n\nThe parliamentary standing committee on defence, headed by BJP veteran Maj. Gen. (retd) B.C. Khanduri, has been a strong advocate of creating a non-lapsable, rollover fund for modernisation of the armed forces.\n\nThis would collect all unspent amounts from the defence capital budget at the end of a financial year into a corpus that can be used for future purchases.\n\nWhile this concept was given a go ahead by the defence ministry last year, the finance ministry has resisted all moves to set it up. Sources said that the standing committee is set to make a fresh bid to set up this fund in its next reports that are to be tabled in Parliament shortly.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "The Council of Ministers on Friday approved a draft budget for 2018, which calls for significant increases in government spending. Jenni Reid\n\nGovernment proposes $6B budget for 2018\n\nThe Council of Ministers on Friday approved a national budget for next year that calls for more than $6 billion in spending, the largest increase ever proposed for the Kingdom, with big boosts for education, defence and the arts.\n\nIn an executive summary of the draft law released on Friday, the Council of Ministers proposes raising the budget by nearly $1 billion, stating that the budget increases are necessary to run the Senate and national elections next year and to improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe royal government must ensure both elections will be smooth, orderly, correct, free and fair,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn addition, the money is also needed \u201cto ensure defence, peace and social stability\u201d in order to prevent \u201cany tricks and any kinds of attempts to make the country fall into chaos and instability\u201d.\n\nThe proposal will go to the National Assembly by the end of the week \u2013 the second time in as many years that the legislative body is forced to decide the budget amid significant political turmoil.\n\nCambodia National Rescue Party President Party President Kem Sokha is currently in pretrial detention on \u201ctreason\u201d charges, while Prime Minister Hun Sen has alleged the party as a whole is involved in a plot to topple the CPP-led government.\n\nLast year, the CPP-controlled National Assembly voted in favour of a $5 billion budget for 2017 in the absence of CNRP lawmakers, who boycotted in protest of a number of politically charged legal cases against their colleagues.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, the Ministry of Education will see the single biggest funding boost, of roughly $167 million, or 24 percent. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Health are also set to receive sizeable increases of 17 and 15 percent, respectively, or $80 million and $63 million.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts would see the single largest percentage increase, more than doubling from $20 million this year to a proposed budget of $47 million.\n\nReached yesterday, CNRP lawmaker Mao Monyvann said he had not yet seen the full budget but $6 billion seemed to be \u201ctoo much\u201d. He said the focus of the budget-makers should be on increasing funding transparency and boosting education.\n\n\u201cTo stay within budget, we suggest more transparency,\u201d Monyvann said. \u201c[For example], before approving any government projects, please have public bidding.\u201d\n\nCambodia\u2019s budget process has been criticised in the past by good governance NGOs, such as International Budget Partners (IBP), for lacking detail and transparency. Since 2015, however, the process has improved, according to IBP\u2019s metrics, with year-end reports now produced for internal use and audits made available to the public, among other reforms. Nonetheless, full budget proposals are typically not made public before passage of the law.\n\nCouncil of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan said that the budget hikes were justified, pointing to needs in the education sector and for recruitment of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe need it,\u201d Siphan said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t need it, why would we increase it?\u201d\n\nSee last year's budget here.\n\nSan Chey, head of the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability Cambodia, expressed concern that the budget process is moving too quickly in an uncertain political climate, with NGOs and lawmakers lacking the opportunity for input.\n\n\u201cThe tense political situation impedes the opposition party from having the opportunity to check and evaluate 2018 national budgets,\u201d Chey said.\n\nAccording to the Council of Ministers, the budget will also fund several initiatives announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen in recent speeches \u2013 including pledges to fund salary increases for civil servants, pregnancy care for garment workers and tax breaks for people who earn less than $300 per month.\n\nThe council did not explain how much the government is budgeting for those initiatives.\n\nSiphan said more detailed questions about the budget would have to wait until the full proposal is sent to the National Assembly for debate. Instead of having the chance to give their input directly, NGOs can try to persuade assembly representatives, he said.\n\n\u201cThey could voice their opinion on what they want and what they don\u2019t agree with to the National Assembly,\u201d he said."

But we will work it out and all countries will be happy.\"\n\nThe fact Canada has no intention of raising defence spending to two per cent was laid out in the Liberal government's defence policy last year. It forecast hitting 1.4 percent of GDP by 2024.\n\nSeveral times on Tuesday, Trudeau outlined the spending his government plans, including the expected purchase of 88 new fighters for the air force and 15 frigates for the navy.\n\nTrudeau shakes hands with Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis following a bilateral meeting in Riga on Tuesday. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nHe described the NATO target as \"easy shorthand\" and a \"limited tool\" and said Canada is always focused on having the capacity to respond when called upon.\n\nThe argument is not dissimilar to one the former Conservative government made when it faced pressure to ramp up defence spending prior to 2015.\n\nTrudeau received some political backing from Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, whose country meets the benchmark and has openly said it is prepared to spend more.\n\nHe said the percentage doesn't matter and it's all about capability.\n\nKucinskis seemed happy to have Canada's commitment to continue to lead one of the three NATO battle groups in the Baltics.\n\n\"Today all of us are a little bit Canadian,\" he told troops at Adazi. \"And we see and we feel that all of the Canadians have become a little bit Latvian.\"\n\nIn addition to announcing the extension, Trudeau revealed that the army will deploy an extra 85 soldiers, many of them logisticians and engineers to help run the battle group.\n\nThe additional commitment will play well at NATO, which is in the process of organizing a division headquarters to co-ordinate the operations in the Baltics.\n\nGen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top military commander, said the additional troops and the extension are welcome."

    "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 An escalating diplomatic crisis between NATO allies Turkey and the United States may risk suspending a $1.5 billion deal between Turkey and Pakistan for the sale of 30 Turkish-made T129 ATAK helicopter gunships.\n\nThe T129 is being produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries under license from the Italian-British company AgustaWestland.\n\n\u201cThe problem is related with the U.S.-made parts for which TAI will need U.S. export licenses in order to materialize the deal,\u201d a Turkish aerospace official said.\n\nThe T129, based on its predecessor A129 Mangusta, is a twin-engine multirole attack helicopter. The T129 is powered by two LHTEC T800-4A turboshaft engines. Each engine can produce 1,014 kilowatts of output power. The T800-4A is an export version of the CTS800 engine. LHTEC is a joint venture between the American firm Honeywell and the British company Rolls-Royce.\n\n\u201cApparently we shall need U.S. export licenses to go ahead with the T129 deal,\u201d a senior procurement official said. \u201cThis is not a technological or financial matter but is purely political at the moment.\u201d\n\nGo face to face with the TAI T129 ATAK helicopter at the Dubai Airshow 2017.\n\nWashington has sanctioned two Turkish ministers, and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium exports to his country. Turkey retaliated by sanctioning two U.S. secretaries, but the row has already sparked a financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has lost 81.5 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the year to Aug. 12.\n\nThe row significantly deepened after a Turkish court refused to release a U.S. pastor who had been in jail since 2016 on charges of terrorism and attempted to topple Turkey\u2019s elected government. Pastor Andrew Craig Brunson was later released from jail to house arrest, but U.S. officials are demanding his immediate release and return to his homeland.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe two NATO allies also have been at odds over U.S. support for Kurdish militants fighting the Islamic State group in northern Syria, as well as Turkey\u2019s refusal to follow U.S. sanctions on Iran, and Ankara\u2019s decision to deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense systems on Turkish soil.\n\n\u201cThis is a commercial deal (with Pakistan) with a country that has friendly relations with America. For Washington what matters should be the recipient of the systems, not who produces it and if relations are bumpy with the producer country,\u201d a Turkish defense official said. \u201cWhy should the Americans punish Pakistan for their disagreements with Turkey?\u201d\n\nA TAI official said a U.S. embargo on the chopper deal was unlikely because it would also hurt a U.S. company as well as two British companies and one Italian. \u201cThese are not enemy producers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are on the ally side. And we (TAI) are not being sanctioned by the U.S. or any other ally country.\u201d\n\nA U.S. diplomat in Ankara refused to comment.\n\nTurkey and Pakistan signed a deal July 13 for 30 T129 ATAK helicopter gunships. Pakistani officials say their own AH-1F Cobra gunships lack the capability to perform adequately over the higher altitudes of the Hindu Kush mountain range separating Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2016, Pakistani officials thoroughly tested the T129 and endorsed the deal.\n\nLHTEC\u2019s T129 engine also powers the 12 AH\u22121Z Viper attack helicopters ordered from the U.S. These are yet to be delivered, and such a timescale remains unclear in view of present U.S.-Pakistani bilateral relations.\n\nTo finance one of the country\u2019s largest defense and aerospace export contracts, Turkey offered Pakistan a $1.5 billion credit line in 2017, but the deal\u2019s payment terms are unknown.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is not always predictable. \u2026 He may wish to punish Turkey by sabotaging such a critical export contract at a time when the Turkish economy is badly ailing. At the same time he may also wish to give a message to the Pakistanis,\u201d according to a European defense attache in Ankara."

Currently the Bundeswehr is receiving portable launchers of the missile. New Puma IFV\u2019s are going to be fitted with the Spike-LR missiles no sooner than in 2018.\n\nAccording to the information obtained by Defence24.pl from the spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defence, the Bundeswehr has acquired a \u201ccertain number\u201d of the MELLS anti-tank missiles (local derivative of the Spike-LR system). The purchases are being still realized. Ultimately, MELLS system is going to replace the Milan ATGW system which is classified as a second generation missile.\n\nAt the moment, the Bundeswehr is receiving MELLS launchers in their portable variant. This type of weaponry is also going to be integrated with the Puma IFV, vehicle which has recently been introduced into service in the German Army. Implementation of this system on the German IFV is planned to happen no sooner than in 2018.\n\nMELLS system uses the Spike-LR Dual missiles which feature a guidance system based on fiber-optics and visible- and thermal-spectrum cameras (similarly as the missiles used by the Polish Army). The missile is capable of destroying armoured targets, including main battle tanks, at distances of up to 4000 meters.\n\nThe contract covering the delivery of the first batch of the Spike missiles for the Bundeswehr has been signed back in 2009 by the Eurospike GmbH joint venture company, with involvement of Diehl BGT Defence (40%), Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (40%) and Rafael. Integration with the Puma IFV is delayed, comparing the current status of the acquisition process with the initial plans.\n\nMilan Missile Launcher on the Marder IFV; Image Credit: Heer/Dana Kazda.\n\nSpike missiles are going to replace the cable-guided Milan 2 ATGW, characterized with a range of 2 kilometres. The Milan missile is capable of penetrating up to 700 mm of armour. Use of this type of missiles requires the operator to observe the target continuously, after firing. The said missiles are also not capable of striking targets that are located behind the obstacles. Milan missiles constitute \u2013 among other weapons \u2013 armament of the Marder IFV\u2019s. The Marder vehicles are going to be replaced by the new Puma IFV. Currently, Milan missiles are also utilized by the German elements of the NATO \u201cSpearhead\u201d unit. This weapon system is also being delivered for the forces of the Iraqi Kurdistan, who are fighting against the IS.\n\nSpike missiles, on the other hand, are widely utilized by the NATO armed forces, including the Polish Army. Poland uses the Spike-LR Dual derivative which is similar to the missile delivered for the Germans. Polish missiles are license manufactured by the ZM Mesko plant. Currently, the Polish Army uses the portable launchers system. Spike missiles are also going to be integrated with the unmanned turrets for the Rosomak APC. In the future they may be used by the prospective Borsuk IFV, based on a track-chassis. Back in January, col. Jacek So\u0144ta, spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Defence, informed Defence24.com that Poland is also willing to integrate the Rosomaks using the Hitfist Turrets, with the Spike system.\n\nREAD MORE: Spike Missiles For Rosomak IFV."

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration, working to increase exports of U.S.-made weapons, has asked the U.S. Congress to review the sale of more than 120,000 precision-guided munitions to allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sources said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol building is seen in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2018. REUTERS/ Leah Millis\n\nPresident Donald Trump has thrown his political weight behind the arms export push to help job growth at home. Last year, his administration approved the sale of about $7 billion of the precision-guided weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat deal raised concerns from some members of Congress over American weapons being used in the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen and the deaths of thousands of civilians there since March 2015.\n\nThe value of the transactions under review now could not immediately be determined.\n\nRaytheon Co is the largest maker of the PGMs in the United States. A company official declined comment.\n\nAdministration and congressional sources confirmed that the informal 40-day review period to sell the munitions to the two countries was under way.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees have been briefed, and lawmakers have asked the administration for more information, which one congressional aide said had not yet been provided.\n\nCommittee spokespeople declined comment.\n\nSaudi and UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress.\n\nThe issue is likely to come up this week when Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, testifies before the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs panels for the first time since the Senate confirmed the former CIA director in his new position last month.\n\nTrump views weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States and has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in January 2017.\n\nHe has at times taken a personal role in pushing through foreign sales of U.S. arms, underscoring his determination to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, despite concerns from human rights and arms control advocates.\n\nKey members of Congress, including the leaders of the two committees, are allowed to informally review major foreign arms sales, and at times they have objected to sales and held them up for months.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of Foreign Relations, blocked major sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf nations for much of last year over a dispute with Qatar, lifting his \u201chold\u201d only early this year.\n\nHowever, if a president wants a sale to go through despite lawmakers\u2019 objections, it can only be stopped if Congress passes legislation blocking the sale. No such measure has ever passed Congress."

It will be supplied by the Gorky Zelenodolsk Shipyard, according to Shepherd Media. The contract is worth $180 million.\n\nRussian defence minister Sergey Shoigu said one of the reasons for Algeria acquiring the Project 22160 was its performance off the Syrian coast.\n\nThe 94 metre long Project 22160 vessels displace 1 300 tons and have a range of 6 000 miles at 30 knots with an endurance of 60 days. Crew is some 80 sailors.\n\nSensors include the Pozitiv-ME1 3D search radar, Pal-N navigation radar and Pallada and Vinyetka-EM sonars and weapons Kalibr-NK cruise missiles as well as a 76.2 mm K-176MA gun or 57 mm AK-220M gun. Apparently, the Algerian version will be armed with Klub-K missiles and Igla surface-to-air missiles. Two rigid-hulled inflatable boats can be carried on each side of the vessel and a helicopter hangar can accommodate a medium sized rotorcraft.\n\nMissions include maritime patrol, exclusive economic zone protection, anti-piracy, counter-terrorism, search and rescue, environmental monitoring and special operations support amongst others.\n\nSix Project 22160 vessels are under construction for Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The first vessel was laid down in February 2014 and was launched in August 2017 \u2013 it is undergoing sea trials and these included firing Kalibr-NK missiles at targets in Syria from the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria is receiving two new Project 636 Kilo class submarines from Russia, with the first about to be delivered and the second nearing sea trials. Algeria has apparently also ordered two additional Kilo 877EKM vessels, for delivery in 2020-2022."

It can engage four targets out to 200 km and altitudes of up to 25 000 metres. The S-300VM is the export version of the S-300 system.\n\nAs a result of the US suspension of some of its $1.3 billion in annual military aid following the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi by the military in July 2013, Egypt has looked to Russia to meet some of its military needs and has agreed to a massive $3.5 billion arms deal, announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2014 exhibition in Pretoria. State-owned company Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov told RIA Novosti that under the deal Russia would supply small arms, air defence equipment and artillery.\n\nRussia is supplying 46 Ka-52K attack helicopters to Egypt and 50 MiG-29M fighter jets, as well as 1000 AT-9 and 100 AT-16 anti-tank missiles for the Ka-52Ks. Russia also donated a Project-1241/Tarantual fast attack craft to Egypt \u2013 this is armed with Moskit/SS-N-22 anti-ship missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Russian equipment delivered in the last five years includes 14 Mi-8MT/Mi-17 helicopters and the EgyptSat-2 reconnaissance satellite."

They will be equipped with Indian-built radar, sonar, communication suites and anti-ship BrahMos missile systems, an Indian Navy official said. The ships are expected to be delivered by the end of 2022, the official added.\n\nIndia and Russia signed an agreement in October 2016 for the purchase and construction of four additional upgraded Kravak III-class stealth frigates, under which two frigates will be directly supplied by Russia and two others built at state-owned Goa Shipyard Limited in India though a technology transfer.\n\nA separate contract will be signed next year for the construction of two similar stealth frigates in India.\n\nThe 4,000-ton Krivak III vessels will also accommodate two multirole helicopters and will be used for anti-submarine and airborne early warning missions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Subsequently, Airbus will promote the aircraft to North American operators.\"During its tour, the C295 will demonstrate its advanced ISR capabilities as well as the platform's versatility and suitability for potential operators, especially in the Asian region,\" Airbus said. The company is also promoting the aircraft to meet regional requirements to enhance surveillance, search and rescue, transport, medical evacuation, and humanitarian missions.Airbus said the aircraft on display in Thailand is a model of the platform recently delivered to the Brazilian Air Force to meet its search and rescue and maritime patrol requirements.Airbus said it sees opportunities to supply the aircraft to the RTN, which is expected in the coming years to replace its ageing fleets of Dornier 228 and Fokker F27 Friendship patrol craft, which were acquired from the 1980s onwards.In addition, Airbus said it is seeking to expand sales of the C295 military transport aircraft to the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) took delivery in June 2016 of a single C295W transport aircraft, although it is understood that the service requires three additional platforms."

This process was completed and therefore the peak of military spending on armaments was over, Peskov noted.\n\n\"So, there is a tendency of a small step-by-step decrease in spending,\" Peskov said.

Ted Aljibe, AFP\n\nMANILA - The United States handed over six surveillance drones to its ally the Philippines on Tuesday, as part of efforts to boost its ability to tackle a growing threat from Islamist militants and to respond to natural disasters.\n\nThe six Boeing Insitu ScanEagle drones, which have two cameras and can operate for up to 24 hours on a single run, were financed through a $13.7 million grant from Washington's foreign military assistance program.\n\nIt follows the transfer of two single-engine surveillance planes last year.\n\nThe Philippines plans to deploy the drones for surveillance against militants and pirates, and for surveying the aftermath of disasters like typhoons, mudslides and earthquakes.\n\n\"This acquisition of ScanEagle is one way to modernize the military to deter those who want to wage war against our country,\" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at a ceremony at a Manila air force base, attended by the U.S. ambassador.\n\n\"This collaboration is also an indication of the Philippines and the United States' goodwill, deep friendship and genuine commitment to peace.\"\n\nThe United States is the most important military partner of the Philippines, with a decades-old treaty alliance and numerous pacts that enable rotational deployment of U.S. troops and annual joint exercises.\n\nHowever, ties have been tested by President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility towards the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military provided technical support and surveillance vital in helping the Philippines end a five-month occupation of Marawi City by pro-Islamic State rebels last year."

    "text": "Japan\u2019s government has approved a record defence budget, with money earmarked for costly missile defence systems and, controversially, weapons that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korea.\n\n\n\nThe 5.19tn yen ($46bn) budget, up 1.3% from last year, is the largest ever and marks the six straight annual rise in defence spending under Japan\u2019s conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe, who ended a decade of defence cuts soon after becoming prime minister in late 2012, has described the threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d.\n\nThe regime has launched two missiles over northern Japan this year, and several others have landed inside its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. In September, North Korea threatened to \u201csink Japan into the sea\u201d with a nuclear bomb after Tokyo and Washington spearheaded a new round of UN security council sanctions against the regime.\n\nDefence officials say Japan needs to drastically and quickly upgrade its missile defence in response to Pyongyang\u2019s rapid development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said this month: \u201cAt a time when North Korea is beefing up its ballistic missile capability, we need to strengthen our capability fundamentally.\u201d\n\nThe new budget, which has to be approved by parliament, came days after Japan said it would buy land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence systems from the US to improve its ability to locate and destroy incoming North Korean missiles.\n\nAbout 730m yen ($6.4m) was set aside to prepare for the introduction of the systems, which will be operational by 2023 and are expected to cost at least 200bn yen.\n\nAmid pressure from hawkish members of Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), Japan will also acquire cruise missiles that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korean military sites.\n\nThe budget includes more than 2bn yen for a Norwegian-built cruise missile with a range of 500km that can be fired from F-35 stealth fighter jets. Japan also plans to buy US-made cruise missiles with a range of 900km.\n\nIn addition to the land-based Aegis radar stations, Japan will invest in a new, longer-range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, and upgrades to Patriot missile batteries \u2013 the last line of defence against incoming warheads.\n\nThe heavy spending on US military hardware comes after Donald Trump vowed to boost arms sales by pressuring Japan and South Korea to play a bigger role in their own defence. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan,\u201d Trump said during a visit to Asia last month.\n\nCritics say possession of a first-strike capability violates Japan\u2019s constitution, which bans the use of force to settle international disputes and has restricted the country\u2019s military to a purely defensive role since the end of the second world war.\n\nOnodera and other senior LDP officials say Japan would target North Korean missile sites only if it believed an attack was imminent \u2013 a move they insist would not violate the country\u2019s \u201cpacifist\u201d principles.\n\nBut Yukio Edano, whose Constitutional Democratic party of Japan fought October\u2019s general election vowing to defend Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, said the acquisition of cruise missiles would be a \u201cfairly big point of dispute\u201d when MPs debate the budget next month.\n\nAkira Kato, a professor of international politics and regional security at JF Oberlin University in Tokyo, said the Abe administration was exploiting the North Korean crisis to bolster Japan\u2019s defences. \u201cJapan is expected to continue strengthening its defence power for the time being,\u201d Kato told Agence France-Presse.\n\nWhile the budget\u2019s focus was on North Korea, it included more than 55bn yen for the construction of military facilities on two outlying islands to boost the ability to respond to Chinese activity in the East China Sea.\n\nThe islands are not far from the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands \u2013 uninhabited outcrops that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, whose vessels regularly enter Japanese waters near the territories."

    "text": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At first glance from above it looks like any clean and neatly planned small town, complete with sports grounds, neat roads and large civic buildings.\n\nBut the town is on Subi reef in the Spratlys archipelago of the hotly contested South China Sea and, regional security experts believe, could soon be home to China\u2019s first troops based in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.\n\nPrivate sector data analysis reviewed by Reuters shows Subi, some 1,200 km (750 miles) from China\u2019s coast, is now home to nearly 400 individual buildings \u2013 far more than other Chinese islands.\n\nSubi could be the future location of hundreds of People\u2019s Liberation Army marines, as well as a possible administrative hub as China cements its claim with a civilian presence, security analysts and diplomatic sources say.\n\nThe data from Earthrise Media, a non-profit group supporting independent media with imagery research, was based on surveys of high-resolution images obtained by DigitalGlobe satellites, dating back to when China started dredging reefs in early 2014.\n\nThe images show neat rows of basketball courts, parade grounds and a wide variety of buildings, some flanked by radar equipment.\n\nEarthrise founder Dan Hammer said his team\u2019s count included only free-standing, permanent and recognizable structures.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at these pictures I see a standard PLA base on the mainland \u2013 it is incredible, right down to the basketball courts,\u201d Singapore-based security analyst Collin Koh said after reviewing the data and images.\n\n\u201cAny deployment of troops will be a huge step, however \u2013 and then they will need to secure and sustain them, so the military presence will have to only grow from where it is now.\u201d\n\nSenior Western diplomats describe the placement of troops or jet fighters on the islands as a looming test of international efforts to curb China\u2019s determination to dominate the vital trade waterway.\n\nSubi is the largest of China\u2019s seven man-made outposts in the Spratlys. The so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d of Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs all share similar infrastructure \u2013 including emplacements for missiles, 3km runways, extensive storage facilities and a range of installations that can track satellites, foreign military activity and communications.\n\nMischief and Fiery Cross each house almost 190 individual buildings and structures, according to the Earthrise analysis. The previously unpublished data details the building count on more than 60 South China Sea features, including those occupied by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines.\n\nWhile the data shows well developed infrastructure on some on islands such as Vietnam's Spratly Island, the Philippines' Thitu Island and Taiwan's Itu Aba, the scale and development by Beijing dwarfs its rivals. (For a multimedia package on the data, click tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne)\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nThe number of buildings on Subi makes it similar in size to Woody Island in the Paracels, a Beijing-controlled group much closer to China also claimed by Vietnam.\n\nWoody is the base and surveillance post which foreign military attaches say is the headquarters of the military division across the South China Sea, reporting to the PLA\u2019s southern theater command.\n\nKoh and other analysts said the facilities on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross could each hold a regiment - between 1,500 to 2,400 troops.\n\nChina\u2019s precise intentions remain unclear and Chinese experts say much will depend on whether Beijing feels threatened by regional security trends, particularly U.S. activity such as its so-called \u201cfreedom of navigation patrols\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s defense ministry did not respond to Reuters questions about the build-up on Subi or what the facilities could be used for.\n\nBeijing has consistently said the facilities on its reclaimed islands are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with their freedom of navigation patrols.\n\nDing Duo, a researcher at the Chinese government-backed National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Beijing needs a military presence in the Spratlys to protect its civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs for how big that presence is depends on the threat assessment China has going forward for the Nansha Islands,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the Spratlys.\n\n\u201cThe Nansha region faces severe military pressure, especially since Trump took office and increased freedom of navigation patrols. So China has raised its threat assessment.\u201d\n\nLOOMING TEST\n\nThe White House said this month it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization after CNBC reported anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems had been installed on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross. [nL1N1SA1VE]\n\nThis weekend, China revealed bombers had conducted take-off and landing training on some of its islands and reefs in preparation for what it called \u201cthe battle for the South China Sea\u201d. [nL3N1SR08Q]\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nSome U.S. analysts noted PLA photographs appeared to show a bomber landing on Woody Island in the Paracels, and the Chinese military has yet to confirm planes actually landed on its Spratlys holdings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to join a major naval drill because of Beijing\u2019s continued militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. [nL2N1SU1KU]\n\nAdmiral Philip Davidson, the nominee to be the next commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific, said last month the bases were now complete and lacked only deployed forces.\n\n\u201cAny forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\u201d Davidson told a congressional panel.\n\nSo far, repeated U.S. naval patrols close to Chinese features and growing international naval deployments through the region have had little obvious impact on Beijing\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cThere is a real sense among Western nations that a new strategy is needed, but there is little sign anything meaningful coalescing,\u201d said one senior Western diplomat familiar with discussions across several countries. \u201cThe deployment of jet fighters \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will sorely test that lack of a cohesive response.\u201d\n\nAlready large Chinese amphibious landing vessels and other ships have used the full-scale naval wharves at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief \u2013 pointing to what foreign naval officers describe as virtually a permanent presence throughout hotly contested waters.\n\nChinese forces are using their island holdings to police of what Chinese naval officers tell other navies is a \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d \u2013 an ambiguous term that both Asian and Western military officials say holds no basis in international law.\n\nPeople briefed on recent Western intelligence reports describe an intensifying pattern of radio challenges to foreign military ships and aircraft delivered from Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on Fiery Cross.\n\nAustralian officials recently publicized a \u201crobust but polite\u201d Chinese challenge to three of its naval ships plying the South China Sea en route to Vietnam.\n\nSources say such exchanges between Chinese and foreign militaries are far more frequent than is widely known.\n\n\u201cThey have become the rule rather than the exception across significant areas of the South China Sea,\u201d one person familiar with recent Western security reports told Reuters.\n\nShips and aircraft from India, France, Japan, New Zealand and rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have also been similarly warned, according to regional military officials and analysts.\n\nWith the claimed \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d having no basis in international law or military practice, foreign naval officials routinely stress they are in international waters and continue on their way.\n\nZhang Baohui, a Chinese security expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, said Beijing was likely to be cautious about any offensive moves, such as the stationing of combat aircraft.\n\n\u201cNow the islands are complete, I think we will see a degree of caution in Beijing\u2019s next moves,\u201d he said. \u201cSustaining that presence so far from the Chinese coast is a massive undertaking, and I think the deployment of troops and jet fighters would really cross a threshold for China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials insist they are leaving little to chance, warning the bases are already helping China project military power into areas once dominated by its neighbors.\n\n\u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d Davidson said in his testimony last month."

    "text": "BRUSSELS \u2015 The European Union has agreed to bolster the ailing European defense industry by allocating \u20ac500 million (U.S. $585.19 million) in 2019 and 2020 to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme.\n\nThe EDIDP is a new program aimed at the development, for instance, of drones for military use or a European cyber defense mechanism. Funding is expected to increase to \u20ac1 billion per year from 2021.\n\nIt means increased pan-EU cooperation in major weapons systems such as aircraft, battle tanks and navy ships should now be possible.\n\nBoom or bust? German industry sizes up Euro-defense potential A whitepaper aims to clean up major misunderstandings surrounding the nascent PESCO process, chiefly the assumption that the construct represents a pot of money for which companies can apply.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the \u201ccore objective\u201d of the funding was to make Europe\u2019s defense industry more competitive and innovative. The program will act as an \u201cenabler for cooperation, incentivising potential collaborative development programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt aims to encourage cooperation in developing the technologies and equipment needed to address common defense and security challenges,\u201d added the spokesman.\n\nWhat remains unclear at this stage, however, is the role and future involvement of the U.K. in EU-funded defense programs after it exits the EU, due to happen at the end of March 2019.\n\nQuestions remain particularly about the impact a British exit will have on the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and, indeed, on the desirable future agreements between the U.K. and the EU in this area.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith a turnover of \u20ac97.3 billion in 2014, 500,000 people directly employed and 1.2 million indirect jobs, the European defence industry is a major industrial sector. But the European defense market has been shrinking, with NATO saying spending on defense by its 26 European members slipped to about $250 billion in 2014 from $275 billion in 2010.\n\nThe new \u20ac500 million funding, announced Wednesday, is partly designed to the give the sector an economic shot in the arm.\n\nThe deal will now be presented to EU ambassadors for their endorsement on May 29, after which it will be submitted to the European Parliament for a vote and then to the EU member states for final adoption.\n\nIt is expected that the program will finance the first capability projects in 2019.\n\nTo foster the pan-EU development of defense systems, the requirement is that a minimum of three companies from three EU countries participate.\n\nFor prototypes, up to 20 percent of the cost could be covered by the program while for other actions such as design or testing, it can go up to 100 percent.\n\nFor the period 2021-2027 the EU also plans to allocate \u20ac13 billion for the European Defence Fund, a relatively new initiative which has already started to fund pan-European research projects.\n\nThe new funding announcement was welcomed by El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, EU commissioner for the internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises, who said the program \u201cis part of our wider efforts to establish a credible Defence Union which protects its citizens. With this agreement, we are building EU\u2019s strategic autonomy and boosting the competitiveness of the EU defense industry.\u201d\n\nFurther comment came from Krasimir Karakachanov, Deputy Prime Minister for Public Order and Security, Minister for Defence of Bulgaria, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, who added, \u201cThis agreement will allow the European Union to fund for the first time a programme on defence capabilities. This new step in our security and defence cooperation reflects the importance in today\u2019s world of doing more as Europeans for our own security.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, a senior French centre right Member of the European Parliament and rapporteur on the issue in Parliament, said, \u201cWe have taken a first and very important step to increase cooperation in the defence industry and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU defence industry.\n\n\u201cThe all-European defense technological and industrial base, in particular our SMEs and mid-caps, will benefit from this program in order to strengthen our strategic autonomy. Excellence and innovation will be the main drivers.\u201d\n\nA source at the European Defence Agency, based in Brussels, said, \u201cmaintenance of a strong and competitive DTIB in Europe is a fundamental underpinning of the European security and defense policy. A robust EDTIB is a prerequisite to the EDA achieving its mission: improving the EU\u2019s defense capabilities."

    "text": "ROME \u2014 The U.S. government\u2019s nuclear warhead agency is scheduled to receive $15.1 billion in the Trump administration\u2019s fiscal 2019 budget request, a 17.5 percent increase over the previous year\u2019s request as the administration seeks to refresh and improve America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe National Nuclear Security Administration, a semiautonomous arm of the Department of Energy, has oversight on nuclear warhead development, production and security. This is the second year the NNSA was slated for a budget increase, although the FY18 request \u2014 $13.9 billion, an increase of 7.8 percent over the FY17 omnibus level \u2014 has yet to be enacted.\n\nThe Nuclear Posture Review, released Feb. 2, called for the development of two new nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as heavy investment in infrastructure to support the nuclear arsenal. But just how NNSA would do in the new budget, which has sometimes struggled with funding in comparison to the broader defense budget, was unclear.\n\nOf the NNSA\u2019s budget, just more than $11 billion are dedicated to weapons activity. The agency is currently doing a massive refresh on its warhead programs, which involves refurbishing and redesigning five warhead variants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government Accountability Office has warned that NNSA is underfunded for its needs.\n\nThe funding will be welcomed by proponents of the NNSA, particularly after comments from the previous administrator, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank Klotz, that his agency was \u201cat capacity.\u201d\n\nNotably, the NNSA could be in line for another plus-up in the FY20 budget. Speaking during the NPR rollout, Steve Erhart, acting undersecretary for nuclear security and NNSA administrator, said to expect \u201cmore fidelity in the budget request in the following year, FY20.\u201d"

    "text": "WASHINGTON: The Polish government is working to renegotiate an arms deal approved by the State Department last year for the U.S.-made HIMARS long-range rocket artillery system after experiencing some sticker shock when seeing the final price tag.\n\nThe $250 million package for the rocket launcher along with guided warheads and other tactical missiles was seen as a way for Poland and NATO to push back against the Russian military buildup in neighboring Kaliningrad, which gives Moscow the ability to track and knock down Polish aircraft over Polish airspace. The HIMARS, Polish officials told me, would give them the ability to hit targets at a longer range if their aircraft were unable to fly.\n\nBut almost six months on, the deal remains a work in progress even as the Trump administration has kicked off a new initiative to eliminate red tape, speed up timelines, and cut costs for sales of U.S. military equipment to allies overseas.\n\nMaj. Gen. Cezary Wi\u015bniewski \u2014 a former F-16 pilot now serving as Poland\u2019s Defense Attache to the United States \u2014 told me during a recent conversation at the Polish consulate here, his government very much wants to move forward with the HIMARS deal, but can\u2019t at the current price. The Polish government and HIMARS-maker Lockheed Martin continue to hash out possibilities for making the deal happen, but neither side would, for the moment, give much insight on how to bring costs down.\n\nWi\u015bniewski said that the mobile rocket artillery system remains a priority due to the continued Russian buildup in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea that allows Russian radars and S-400 missile systems to reach deep inside Polish territory, essentially taking away any home field advantage Polish pilots might have in the event of a conflict.\n\nCrucially, the deal also supports a Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) between Lockheed and PGZ, Poland\u2019s state-run defense group, which is the prime contractor in Poland.\n\nA spokesperson for Lockheed told me that the company \u201cis fully committed\u201d to working the deal, and \u201chas remained engaged and flexible with PGZ, ready to finalize a [missile defense] offering that will provide commonality and interoperability with U.S. forces and NATO partners.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Warsaw wants out of the deal are offsets, which would allow PGZ to build components in Poland.\n\nJust last month, as part of inking the largest arms deal in Polish history \u2014 a $4.75 billion contract for Patriot air defense systems and other associated equipment \u2014 Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman agreed to offsets worth about $280 million.\n\nNegotiations over Phase II of that Patriot program began on April 16, and include talks about buying a 360 degree radar, and additional offsets.\n\n\u201cWe would like to procure the same 360 degree radar that is under development by the U.S. Army,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said. \u201cIt has not been selected by the Army, yet so we are waiting. We would like to use the same system so the integration and sustainment costs would be lower.\u201d\n\nBut the Polish government is also looking to shift more work to its own defense industry. \u201cWe expect the Phase II would provide us more technology transfer than Phase I,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for more technology transfer for our industry.\u201d\n\nOne key element of the current negotiations is Raytheon\u2019s low-cost SkyCeptor interceptor missile, which would be used in a nascent short-range interceptor program called Narew, which Warsaw wants to build locally, according to Wi\u015bniewski.\n\nThe general described a gap in the budding Polish air defense ecosystem between shoulder-fired MANPADS and the Patriot, a gap that will be filled by Narew, which his government considers crucial in bulking up its borders with Kaliningrad and providing the NATO alliance with more ground punch.\n\n\u201cIt helps us to deter,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysis haven\u2019t been surprised by the Polish interest in more air defenses, and its willingness to spend a lot of money to acquire the. \u201cI think this is a natural case of Poland looking to balance Russian military modernization and leverage their sizable defense budget to adjust for a new generation of capabilities deployed in Kaliningrad,\u201d said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA. \u201cOf course there is also the political aspect to defense procurement, seeking to leverage defense spending as another instrument to further build ties with the United States,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe original HIMARS announcement in November was part of a wave of big buys \u2014 including September\u2019s $1.25 billion agreement to sell the HIMARS and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Romania, who also agreed on a deal for seven Patriot Configuration 3 units in November \u2014 that signaled to Moscow that the alliance was was meeting Russian buildups in Kaliningrad and Crimea.\n\nAny HIMARS deal with Poland would be significant for NATO, as other than Romania, the only foreign buyers have been Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, while Qatar has received authorization to buy the system.\n\nThe government in Bucharest announced during in the summer of 2017 that it planned to buy HIMARS, along with 36 F-16 fighter jets by 2022, part of a long-term pan to lay out $11.6 billion on military procurements between 2017 through 202"

    "text": "The Air Force just massed an amazing array of fire power. It just might have been in the wrong place.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2018, two U.S. Air Force wings in Utah launched thirty-five F-35 stealth fighters in a short span of time.\n\nThe air force lauded the display as evidence of America's overwhelming military might. At least one critic dismissed it as a publicity stunt.\n\nIn fact, there's one region where mass-takeoffs are an important military procedure: the Korean Peninsula. Ironically, that's the one region where the Trump administration is deliberately limiting the flying branch's authority to organize large-scale warplane-launches.\n\nThe November group-takeoff, which the air force calls an \"elephant walk,\" involved F-35As from the 388th and 419th Fighter Wings at Hill Air Force Base. The active-duty 388th and reserve 419th train air force F-35 pilots.\n\nThe 388th's 34th Fighter Squadron, whose F-35s have the latest Block 3F software, also has a front-line role. In late 2017, it became the first air force F-35 unit to deploy overseas, to Japan.\n\nAt the time of the elephant walk\u2014the first for the F-35\u2014the Utah wings possessed around forty F-35s. The wings are on track to receive a combined seventy-two F-35s by 2019.\n\nThe Hill stealth fighters took off one at a time in roughly 30-second intervals. In just a few minutes, the wings launched as many F-35 sorties as they normally do in a full day of routine training.\n\n\"Exercising with multiple squadrons of F-35s can demonstrate our ability to defeat potential adversaries wherever they may arise,\" Maj. Caleb Guthmann, the 34th Fighter Squadron's assistant director of operations, said in a statement.\n\nBut Valerie Insinna, a reporter for Defense News, echoed a more cynical sentiment when, on Twitter, she described the elephant walk as \"cool\" but \"very choreographed.\"\n\n\u201cCall me when they fix all the ALIS problems and then we'll talk,\u201d Insinna added, referring to the F-35's buggy Autonomic Logistics Information System, a computer network for the type's maintainers.\n\nIn a March 2018 congressional hearing, Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the air force's deputy chief of staff for plans, programs and requirements, said it cost around $50,000 to fly one F-35 for an hour. That's roughly twice what an F-16 costs for an hour in the air.\n\nIn fact, elephant walks significantly contribute to the readiness of American and allied squadrons in South Korea and nearby countries.\n\nIn the event of war with North Korea, U.S. and allied forces plan to quickly target the roughly 13,000 artillery pieces that Pyongyang has massed along the Korean demilitarized zone. In the early hours of a war, that artillery likely would bombard Seoul, which lies just 25 miles south of the DMZ.\n\n\"A serious, credible threat to 25 million [Republic of Korea] citizens and approximately 150,000 U.S. citizens living in the [Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area] is also posed from its long-range artillery,\" U.S. Army general Vincent Brooks, head of U.S. Forces Korea, told a U.S. Senate committee in March 2018.\n\nThe air force maintains three F-16 squadrons and an A-10 squadron in South Korea and two F-15 squadrons in Japan. Additional squadrons, almost certainly including F-35 units, would join them during a crisis. An air campaign targeting North Korea would require 2,000 sorties per day, U.S. military officials told Air Force magazine.\n\nBy comparison, the allied air war over Iraq and Kuwait in January 1991 averaged 1,200 strike sorties per day, according to statistics compiled by David Deptula, a former air force general who is now an analyst for the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Virginia. The U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria averaged just fifteen strikes per day, according to Deptula.\n\nThe roughly 100 U.S. F-16s and A-10s in South Korea and Japan\u2014and any F-35s that deployed in time for the first day of fighting\u2014likely would be the first to hit North Korean artillery. And they'd have to launch fast to save lives in Seoul.\n\nThere is a reason that the 7th Air Force in South Korea and Japan has organized more elephant walks than most air force commands have done. \"The threat here on the peninsula is very real, and countering that threat needs to be in the forefront of our minds,\" Col. William D. Betts, then-commander of the 51st Fighter Wing in South Korea, said in 2017.\n\nBut the Korea elephant walk is an endangered species. The 7th Air Force has conducted most of its mass-takeoffs, which require intensive planning and maintenance efforts, under the auspices of the annual Vigilante Ace exercise.\n\nIn 2018 the Trump administration suspended Vigilant Ace as a concession to North Korea, hoping that Pyongyang in turn would suspend its nuclear-weapons program. North Korea has continued to develop its nukes.\n\nThe air force organized elephant walks in South Korea in 2016 and 2017 but not in 2018. The suspension of large-scale exercises with South Korea hasn\u2019t created \"immediate\" concerns about combat-readiness, Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. Charles Brown said in November 2018. But it could cause \"difficulties\" if it continues.\n\nThere's nothing preventing air force squadrons that aren't in South Korea, including Hill's F-35 units, from practicing mass takeoffs. These same squadrons might deploy to the Korean Peninsula during wartime, in which case their elephant walks would amount to more than an expensive public relations exercise.\n\nThey'd be preparation for the kind of sudden, overwhelming violence a new Korean war would require.\n\nDavid Axe edits War Is Boring.

    "text": "Covering politicians who constantly say stupid things while hoping that they will say a sensible thing in the future is a symptom of journalism in the age of extreme populism.\n\nInstead of treating every madcap utterance with surprise, it is time to make peace with the fact that, when speaking of science, Union \u2018science\u2019 minister Harsh Vardhan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi simply lack the competence to speak knowledgeably. They are not going to say sensible stuff in the future. It is time to stop covering each proclamation that \u201cthe Vedas said it all\u201d with a clarification that they did not. Everyone who has ever been willing to be persuaded otherwise has already been persuaded otherwise; the facts, as they say, are right there.\n\nJournalism has reason to value objectivity above all else but objectivity is not \u2018balance\u2019 in some mechanical sense; it is the capacity to evaluate a bit of information such that the evaluator can eliminate cognitive and intellectual biases from the evaluation. Not surprisingly, those who would end up on the wrong end of a truly objective evaluation are the ones who demand \u2018evenhandedness\u2019 and scream the loudest about bias when a report is not empathetic. Hence the popular perception that if a story quotes someone saying A is wrong, it must also include the voices of those who think A is right.\n\nYet even this demand for false balance goes out the window the moment a minister comes along to publicly proclaim that people flew airplanes 3,000 years ago and grafted elephant heads onto human bodies. There is no point in collecting quotations from those who believe the minister is right when objective methods of evaluation have established that the minister is wrong. This is not journalism\u2019s loss of objectivity because misconstrued objectivity was never journalism\u2019s purpose.\n\nIndeed, pretensions of objectivity would be downright unethical while reporting on a science minister\u2019s pseudoscientific claims on a stage meant for scientists, and the audience\u2019s quiet tolerance of his words.\n\nAny other country with aspirations akin to India\u2019s on the science front might have shunned a man as unhinged in his opinions of science as Harsh Vardhan, but he is protected in India by a culture that exalts, and sometimes makes excuses for, political and bureaucratic patronage. In a political culture fixated on hero worship, journalism should question his right \u2013 and those who afford him that right \u2013 to insult our intelligence and debase the endeavours of highly qualified men and women his ministry is responsible for supporting.\n\nThe man seems unstoppable \u2013 and it no longer seems fair for us to expect him to stop. At the 105th Indian Science Congress that kicked off in Imphal on Friday, Harsh Vardhan went on stage to say that Stephen Hawking had acknowledged that the Vedas might have \u201coffered a better theory\u201d than the mass-energy equivalence in Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity (the latter probably better known as the equation E = mc2).\n\nWhat Vardhan has said has no meaning. The Vedas could have offered a better theory for what exactly? E = mc2 is not a theory \u2013 it is a \u2018problem\u2019 that requires solving in contexts where the relationship between the variables as specified in the equation applies. More generally, E = mc2 is not the kind of solution Vardhan is hoping it could have been because it wasn\u2019t exclusively developed to resolve a germane problem. On the contrary, it was developed first, based on which humans invented challenges that the equation could help surmount.\n\nIt is also funny that Vardhan\u2019s celebration of the Vedas as an instrument with which to claim historic primacy and superiority directly contradicts the manner in which the minister sought to use a scientist from the very West that he and his parivar deride as a crutch for his nonsensical claim.\n\nFinally, Hawking himself has never acknowledged that \u201cthe Vedas are better\u201d (Update, March 18: a member of the Stephen Hawking Foundation\u2019s governance panel has attested to this). The source of Vardhan\u2019s claims has been tracked to a Facebook page run by a user whose display name is Stephen Hawking, with a note that provides no sources for its contents. Additionally, in claiming what he did, Vardhan has also insulted the memory of Hawking, a staunch atheist and rationalist wholly antithetical to the idea of mixing religion and politics.\n\nWhat doing science means\n\nHarsh Vardhan\u2019s recklessly utilitarian conception of science \u2013 in which the only question he wants us to ask is \u201cWhat good is this to me?\u201d \u2013 has no space for science\u2019s non-functional value.\n\nHe and his government believe that when 0.8% of the country\u2019s GDP is being channeled into R&D, it is possible to ensure all of it is further channeled only into translational and/or technologisable outcomes by tweaking scholarship policies, tugging on higher-education infrastructure development and by announcements of intent. It is likely that the government is not stopping to think about whether science itself can work that way.\n\nIt can\u2019t. It will stall, splutter, choke on itself and blow up \u2013 particularly in a growth-minded country like India.\n\nIf Einstein had to be wondering about relativity just so he could make the world a better place, he might not have bothered with the question in the first place. But today, the mass-energy equivalence informs everything from nuclear power to manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nIt is also important that Einstein had to be selfish, self-absorbed, even privileged to some extent. No good can come of vilifying these attributes when it is clear to everyone that, with one\u2019s heart in the right place, enormous \u201cvalue\u201d can be created. But no, Vardhan and the administration to which he belongs have only displayed a lack of trust in the morality of India\u2019s scientists. Instead of letting science be what each scientist wants to achieve with its rules and apparatuses, with stringent quality control, accountability and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 an equitable vision for scientific research in the country, the government has been attempting to homogenise everyone\u2019s vision of science in the image of its own. And if you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\n\nThis is not going to end well. The moment is already upon us when reacting from strength of insight instead of from fear of criticism \u2013 to adapt Jay Rosen\u2019s criticism of the Times \u2013 is no longer an option. If not, we might as well all go to hell. Or whatever the Vedic equivalent of it is."

IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly quoted Mohamed Emad el-Kabbany, MSPV\u2019s assistant manager for sales and business development, as saying that Egypt is receiving between 2 000 and 3 000 Panthera T6s for its police and army.\n\nHe added that Egyptian company Eagles Defence International Systems (EDIS) is the company\u2019s Egyptian agent \u2013 in 2014 it was reported that EDIS was producing the Panthera T6, as well as the larger S10 and K10CMD.\n\nThe Panthera T6 was first seen in May 2014 during an Egyptian military parade and subsequently seen in the Sinai Peninsula. At least some have been fitted with electronic warfare equipment for use in the Sinai.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its Arms Transfers Database, lists 50 Panthera T6s being ordered from the UAE in 2013, with deliveries from 2014-2015.\n\nAccordign to MSPV, the Panthera T6 is powered by a 4 litre V6 petrol engine driving all four wheels through a five speed manual transmission. It seats two plus six, although other seating arrangements are available. Features include air conditioning, a remote controlled roof mounted search light and camera, optional gun ports and hatches.\n\nThe Panthera T6 is based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 79-series chassis. An optional mount on the roof can accommodate a machinegun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibya has apparently taken delivery of Panthera T6s donated by the United Arab Emirates. They were delivered in April 2016. The Panthera T6 was seen several times in March 2015 in use by the Libyan National Army. In September last year Indian security forces introduced the vehicle into service, particularly for security in Jammu and Kashmir."

    "text": "The government must lift the ban on media access and ensure that the repatriation of refugees is acceptable to the international community.\n\nBy SITHU AUNG MYINT | FRONTIERWHEN THE National League for Democracy government took office in March 2016, there was intense interest in its plans for developing the economy.State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi decided that economic development depended on ending decades of civil war and made the pursuit of peace the government\u2019s top priority, a cause to which she has devoted much time and energy.The NLD government\u2019s efforts to attract foreign investment, which included legislative reforms, received a boost when the United States lifted all remaining economic sanctions against Myanmar in September 2016. The next month, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army launched the first of a coordinated series of attacks on security posts in northern Rakhine State.They were followed by another series of attacks last August, which led to a massive military counter-insurgency operation that triggered the exodus of more than 688,000 Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh. Many Myanmar initially believed that conflict and violence in a remote corner of the country was unlikely to have a negative impact on economic development, but it is now clear they were wrong. This week I\u2019d like to discuss the adverse effects of the Rakhine crisis on the economy.In a shock decision on February 1, Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose, the Myanmar affiliate of a New York-based law firm, announced that it was closing its Yangon office at the end of the month. In 2013, it became the first American law firm to open for business in Myanmar amid the high expectations for economic growth fuelled by foreign investment after the country began its transition to democracy in 2011.HRMR\u2019s lead director, Mr Eric Rose, was quoted as saying there were three main reasons that influenced the decision to close shop in Myanmar. In lengthy interviews withand, he cited government inaction on the economy, the Rakhine crisis, and remaining US financial sanctions together with the suspension of the European Union-Myanmar investment protection agreement.It is clear that economic development has been adversely affected by the situation in Rakhine. Rose said the Rakhine crisis, particularly the flight of more than 750,000 refugees, had created a reputational risk that deterred Western companies from investing in Myanmar. The risk was \u201cin particular due to the lack of a coherent response from the Myanmar government\u201d to the situation in Rakhine, he toldThe Rakhine crisis is not only a border problem, a religious and ethnic problem, a human rights problem and a sovereignty problem, but a problem that is directly related to economic development. That it was a factor in the decision to close the Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose office after five years is an indication of the importance of solving the Rakhine problem.What needs to be done to address the problem that has attracted intense domestic and international interest?Media coverage of the violence in northern Rakhine after the August attacks last year has had a negative effect on Myanmar\u2019s international image. It has included accounts of atrocities against Muslims and the burning of their homes to drive them out of the country.Initially, the government and the Tatmadaw denied allegations of human rights abuses during the counter-insurgency operation. Then news emerged of the massacre at Inn Din village in Maungdaw Township on September 2 last year. An exhaustive account of the Inn Din massacre published byon February 8 included interviews with Buddhist villagers who admitted torching Muslim homes, burying bodies and killing Muslims.The report also included the accounts by security personnel of their role in an operation to drive Muslims from the village.said it was the first time soldiers and paramilitary police were implicated by testimony from other security personnel.A week before the Reuters investigation was published,reported that there were at least five mass graves containing the bodies of Muslims at Gu Dar Pyin village in Buthidaung Township. The report said that before victims were thrown into mass graves, acid was poured on their faces to prevent them from being identified.On February 2, the government denied the report, saying a clash at the village on August 27 last year had resulted in the deaths of 19 \u201cterrorists\u201d who had been \u201ccarefully buried\u201d by the security forces. The Rakhine State government threatened to suewhich said it stood by its reporting.On media coverage, there is only one way forward. The ban on media access to northern Rakhine must be lifted so that the international community may learn the truth about what happened during the counter-insurgency operation launched after the August 25 attacks.The Annan commission on Rakhine recommended \u201cfull and regular\u201d media access, saying that the ban was counterproductive. Media access has also been urged by former Thai foreign minister, Mr Surakiart Sathirathai, who heads a board appointed by the government to advise the committee formed to implement the Annan commission recommendations.Another important issue is the repatriation and resettlement of refugees, which must be accomplished successfully, no matter how many difficulties need to be overcome. Muslims should be resettled where they had lived before they fled Myanmar and be able to live without fear.The repatriation process must be conducted in a way that is acceptable to the international community. Otherwise, the Rakhine problem will continue to hinder economic development in Myanmar.who are they ?"

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 The French Armed Forces Minister called July 23 for industry to play a greater role in servicing heavily used military vehicles, with companies called to support 40 percent of the mixed fleet by the middle of the next decade.\n\nSpeaking at Bruz, a base for vehicle support in western France, Minister Florence Parly said the service goal compares to the present 15 percent, with a target of 2025.\n\nThe minister announced a \u201ctransformation plan\u201d for vehicle support based on an official report by defense procurement official Vincent Imbert and Army Gen. Bernard Guillet.\n\n\"The improvement of our maintenance process and availability of our equipment is one of my priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nThat call for greater support reflects problems in servicing a highly mixed fleet, including new-generation armored vehicles to be delivered in the Scorpion program, modern VBCI infantry fighting vehicles and Caesar truck-mounted artillery, and an aging park of VAB troop carriers and VBL scout cars.\n\nThe plan seeks to boost the availability of vehicles by restructuring the industrial and technological base for service, boost a sense of responsibility of the personnel using the vehicles, and reshaping links between the armed forces and industry, the ministry said in a briefing note. There are also plans to increase local support in the deployed theaters and adopt new technology in monitoring and predicting breakdowns.\n\nThere is a high availability of more than 90 percent for vehicles in overseas operations, but those vehicles return to France in poor condition, with only 65 percent of the various fleets available for use once back on national territory, the ministry said. That availability varies greatly depending on the type of vehicle.\n\nThat means there is a lack of vehicles for training troops for deployment. Some 3,500 vehicles are broken down and there is a lack of capability to reduce that number. The British and German forces face similar problems, with lower availability and lack of an organization to improve the situation, the ministry said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe modernization plan calls for closer ties between government maintenance organizations, the armed forces and manufacturers including Arquus, Nexter, Safran and Thales, as well as specialist NSE and small- and medium-sized enterprises, the ministry said. Those actors should use more efficient tools and methods, and cut out duplication and waste of resources and time.\n\nA French military modernization program is getting a makeover Scorpion is seen as more than just bringing in new vehicles and equipment, as the French Army is rewriting the concept of operations to adapt to new technology.\n\nThe official report pointed up a \u201clack of sense of responsibility\u201d of the users as the vehicles are held in pools rather than assigned specifically, a contrast to an attachment of Air Force and Navy personnel who are closely tied to their aircraft and ships.\n\nCompanies showed a weak link with service support in the land sector, also in contrast to ties seen between industry and the naval and aeronautical sectors, the report said.\n\nThere should be greater use of new technology, adopting 3D printing and the use of health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) to predict breakdowns, the report said. Development under the Scorpion program offered industry an opportunity not to be missed to incorporate such technology.\n\nThe report called for equipment which was beyond repair to be handed over to industry to repair and resell, with the money to be shared between the government and industry.\n\n\"This reform requires a mobilization and a greater responsibility of industry in their performance and their capacity to honor the client\u2019s needs, whose objective is both to be effective on the ground and to guarantee the safety of soldiers,\u201d Parly said.\n\nSome 13,000 personnel are employed on vehicle service, with 11,000 in the armed forces. The balance is split between two government organizations \u2014 SMITer and SIMMT. The latter awards service contracts to companies.\n\nSome \u20ac1 billion (US $1.2 billion) has been earmarked for land vehicle service in the 2019-2015 defense budget law."

    "text": "Algeria evaluating Chinese CH-4 UAV\n\nDenel Seeker 400 takes to the skies\n\nWritten by defenceWeb, Tuesday, 11 March 2014Algerian is evaluating the Chinese CH-4 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is reportedly very interested in acquiring the type, which can be armed with guided weapons.The CH-4, developed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA), has been undergoing testing with the Algerian military for some months, according to Air Forces Daily. One is reported to have crashed during testing at the Algerian Air Force\u2019s base at Tindouf several months ago while a second one crashed on Sunday at the Ain Oussera Air Base. The UAV came down 100 metres short of the runway whilst preparing to land.In spite of the crashes, Algeria is apparently still very interested in acquiring the CH-4 (Cai Hong 4 or Rainbow 4), which appears to have been inspired by the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. The UAV, with a takeoff weight of 1.3 tons and a payload of 350 kg, has a wingspan of 18 metres and a length of 8.5 metres. Top speed is 235 km/h and operational altitude is 3000-3500 metres, according to officially released data, while combat radius is 2000 km and endurance is 36 hours.CAAA technical staff claim the CH-4 has four hard points capable of carrying two AR-1 laser-guided missiles and two FT-5 small guided bombs.The CH-4 was first seen at the Zuhai airshow in 2012 and in the absence of Chinese military interest it seems the aircraft is aimed at the export market.Algeria has reportedly also been in discussions with China over the purchase of Xianglong unmanned aerial vehicles. Echorouk quoted an unnamed Algerian defence ministry colonel as saying that the UAV was successfully tested in Tamanrasset, southern Algeria, last year.The Xianglong (Soar Dragon) is a jet-powered High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft designed by the Guizhou Aircraft Corporation of China, initially for use by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force. The Xianglong has a length of 14 metres, a height of 5 metres and a wingspan of 25 metres. It has a top speed of 750 km/h, endurance of up to 10 hours, and a maximum range of 7 000 km.Tactical Weekly earlier this year reported that the Algerian Defence Ministry is said to have decided to go ahead with a programme to buy 90 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including attack UAVs.Last year, Algeria expressed interest in the Adcom Systems Yabhon United 40 Block 5 UAV from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to meet its Medium-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) requirement. According to Algerian daily El Watan, Algeria is negotiating with Russia to purchase 30 E95 unmanned aerial vehicles/target drones from Russia.Algeria is looking for aerial reconnaissance platforms to track down various Maghreb-based terrorist groups, drug and arms traffickers and militants who have taken advantage of post-war chaos in Mali and Libya to destabilise the Sahel-Maghreb region.Algeria currently flies Denel Seeker II UAVs and is believed to have ordered one new Seeker 400 system with three aircraft. The Seeker 400 is currently undergoing flight testing.The North African country has previously expressed interest in General Atomics Predator/Reaper UAVs. It also has six King Air 350ER surveillance aircraft fitted with Gabbiano T-200 radars, Wescam Mx15i infrared cameras and other features for maritime and ground surveillance.Since war clouds started gathering over northern Mali in November 2012, the Algerian army has deployed more than 12 000 personnel to secure the borders with Mali, Libya and Niger.Algeria has increased its defence budget for 2014 and is actively seeking new tankers, transports, helicopters and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. Last year Algeria evaluated the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport and Airbus A330 MRTT tanker with an eye to replacing ageing Il-78 Midas tankers and acquiring a new transport aircraft. Algeria asked the two respective companies to conduct demonstrations, indicating the seriousness of these potential contracts.Algeria is growing its defence spending by 6% through 2017, according to some estimates, as it modernises and re-equips to meet the challenge of insecurity and terrorism in the region.....Written by Guy Martin, Wednesday, 26 February 2014Denel\u2019s new Seeker 400 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) completed its first round of flight tests earlier this month at the Alkantpan test range in the Northern Cape, after a three year development process.The test flights were successful and will be followed by another round of testing in March ahead of production starting around the second half of this year.\u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Denel and again confirms our global leadership position in the design and manufacturing of UAVs,\u201d said Tsepo Monaheng, the CEO of Denel Dynamics.The Seeker 400 was originally due to fly a couple of years ago but was delayed due to contracting and certification issues, according to manufacturer Denel Dynamics. Denel\u2019s annual report for the 2012/13 financial year also identified \u201ccomplexities with the key subsystems\u201d as another reason for \u201csignificant variation in the programme schedule, including a delay of the maiden flight test.\u201dThe Seeker 400 was displayed in mock-up form at the 2010 Africa Aerospace and Defence exhibition. It has an endurance of 16 hours, a ceiling of 18 000 feet and a cruising speed is 150 km/h. Denel Dynamics says it is inaudible at altitudes higher than 1 000 metres above the ground and invisible to someone on the ground when flying at typical operating altitudes of between 4 500 and 9 000 feet.The Seeker 400 can carry 100 kg and this can include two payloads at the same time, including electro-optical/infrared and radar as well as a laser rangefinder and illuminator for target designation. Denel says an electronic surveillance payload is available for the detection and location of radar emitters. Future upgrades will include satellite communications, and sense-and-avoid capability in order to obtain civil aviation certification.Currently, the Seeker 400 has a range of 250 km, because it uses only line-of-sight communications, but it could be upgraded to use satellite communications, which would allow it to operate at much greater ranges. With the use of the existing tactical ground station (TGS), the range may be extended to 750 km.Denel Dynamics is executing a production contract for the UAV\u2019s launch customer (which previously operated the Seeker I) and has also attracted strong interest from other potential clients, with most demand expected to come from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South America. Denel is promoting the Seeker 400 to Seeker II customers, as the new UAV can be flown with Seeker II control stations.Monaheng said the Seeker 400 is a highlight in South Africa\u2019s development of local UAVs, which started in the mid-1980s. Its forerunner, the Seeker II, has been deployed in operational service by international clients, including in Afghanistan. The Seeker was also the first UAV in the world cleared for operations in controlled airspace when it was deployed to monitor potential hotspots during South Africa\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994.The Seeker II has undergone further developments by Denel Dynamics, and has since rebranded as the Seeker 200, and offered to clients who require a medium endurance and dual payload capability offered by the latest version."

    "text": "TOKYO -- Japan is considering selling air defense radar technology to the Philippines in what would be its first export of defense equipment since ending a nearly 50-year ban in 2014.\n\nTokyo is sounding out the Philippines about buying an upgraded model of the Mitsubishi Electric-made FPS-3 air defense radar system, which Japan's Air Self-Defense Force has used since 1991 in missile defense and monitoring airspace incursions. Tokyo has already begun offering technical information on the system to Manila.\n\nJapan's thinking goes that upgrading the less-than-cutting-edge radar to meet the Philippines' needs will keep costs down, helping it win orders. The price is expected to be between 1 billion yen and 2 billion yen ($8.87 million and $17.7 million). Manila has also approached the U.S. and Israel on the matter, according to a source connected to the Japanese government, and may decide as early as the start of next year.\n\nJapan's defense cooperation with the Philippines, which had centered on joint military exercises, has expanded into defense equipment in recent years. In March, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force donated TC-90 trainer craft to the Philippine navy. And Japan agreed in June to grant parts for multi-mission UH-1H helicopters formerly used by the Ground Self-Defense Force to the Philippine air force.\n\nThe two sides are interested in partnering on maritime security as China continues to build up its military presence in the South China Sea, a vital sea lane for goods and energy shipments for both Tokyo and Manila. By exporting air-defense radars to the Philippines, Japan hopes to improve the Southeast Asian country's detection and surveillance capabilities and help maintain safety in the region.\n\nJapan essentially banned arms exports for decades until April 2014, when the cabinet laid out basic rules letting the country transfer defense equipment and technology and participate in international joint development under certain conditions, such as when it contributes to Japan's security. Selling the radars to the Philippines was judged appropriate because it would further bilateral defense cooperation.\n\nTokyo has not yet sold any defense equipment under the new rules. Japan sought to build submarines for export to Australia, but lost the deal to France in 2016. An effort to sell P-1 patrol jets to the U.K. also fell through, and Japan lost a bid to supply radar for the Thai air force to a Spanish company."

    "text": "Taipei has a new idea instead: the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nTAIPEI - Taiwan\u2019s air force will cease campaigning for the F-35 Lightning stealth fighter aircraft and will, instead, reissue a request to the U.S. government for F-16 fighters.\n\nThe new proposal will push for the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nThis is, in part, a resurrection of an abandoned effort to procure sixty-six F-16C/D Block 50/52s killed by the Obama administration due to Chinese pressure. Beijing had dubbed the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan a \u201cred line\u201d and has repeatedly threatened to invade the self-ruled island.\n\nThe new campaign will also request co-production and performance-based logistics (PBL) as part of the overall package. PBL would improve combat effectiveness by 80 percent, say Taiwan defense industry sources.\n\nOne source said PBL was a \u201ccritical part of the package\u2026we must have it.\u201d\n\nThe package is consistent with Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s indigenous defense industry policy that mandates local production of weapon systems that in the past were procured only from the United States. In part, the policy weens Taiwan away from dependency on the United States for weapon sales that are often influenced by Washington\u2019s fickle relationship with Beijing.\n\nLocal sources also want the PBL to expand later to include Taiwan\u2019s current F-16 upgrade effort. Taiwan procured 150 F-16A/B Block 20 fighters in the 1990s and is currently upgrading them to F-16V as part of the $5 billion Phoenix Rising Program.\n\nThe PBL could later be expanded for the fleet of twenty C-130H Hercules cargo/transport aircraft and twelve P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, all Lockheed Martin products.\n\nThe air force is also upgrading its Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF) under a program that will allow the IDF to carry more munitions and replace its radar and combat computer. Taiwan is down to 126 aircraft from the original 130 due to crashes. It was constructed in the 1990s by state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) in Taichung, which is also participating in the F-16V upgrade program.\n\nAIDC is currently manufacturing a new advanced jet trainer (AJT) to replace its ageing AT-3 and F-5 fighter trainers. The new AJT, expected to roll-out in late 2019, is loosely based on the IDF design. AIDC plans to build sixty-six aircraft with operational deployment in 2026.\n\nThe air force turned its back on pursuing the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) fighter due to a recent Taiwan National Security Council report. It indicated the stealth fighter was too exorbitant and untested in real combat to be a pragmatic choice for Taiwan.\n\nThere are also suspicions in Taiwan that opposition to the sale of a fifth-generation fighter would be raised in Washington over secrecy issues, as mainland Chinese espionage on the island is rampant.\n\nThe STOVL option was originally considered a practical requirement due to China\u2019s vast arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. Military analysts in Taiwan and Washington predict that the air bases will be pummeled during the initial phase of a war.\n\nHowever, Taiwan still needs an advanced fighter aircraft capability to maintain sovereignty and control of its air space, especially as China begins testing the island\u2019s air defense capabilities with fighter and bomber aircraft sorties that now circumnavigate the island.\n\nTaiwan will also retire its ageing Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft due to high maintenance costs and to make room in the budget for new F-16s. Of the sixty fighters France sold Taiwan in the 1990s, fifty-six remain operational. \u201cWe would like to resale the Mirage fighters to a third country,\u201d said one source.\n\nWendell Minnick is an author, commentator, journalist and speaker who has spent two decades covering military and security issues in Asia, including one book on intelligence and over 1,200 articles. From 2006-2016, Minnick served as the Asia Bureau Chief for Defense News, a Washington-based defence weekly newspaper."

Both UAV types are the outcomes of efforts of a team of .\n\n\u201cNAF\u2019s foray into UAV development commenced in 2008, when its student officers, who were undergoing postgraduate studies in aerospace engineering programmes at Cranfield University, UK, chose UAV development as their research project. The student officers produced the as part of their project and it had neither autopilot nor Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability.\n\n\u201cBy 2013, the NAF developed an experimental UAV, codenamed GULMA, which was then unveiled as the first indigenous UAV. It is noteworthy that Gulma UAV was a technology demonstrator used to gather performance data on UAV systems.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in September 2015, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), , directed the NAF\u2019s R&D Team to build an operational UAV, codenamed Tsaigumi to be used in the Northeast and other theatres of operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe data gathered from the Gulma prototype was subsequently applied in the design of the operational UAV, known as Tsaigumi, and inducted into service on 15 February 2018. Although the Tsaigumi UAV was manufactured at the Air Force Research and Development Centre at NAF Base Kaduna, the Team had to collaborate with an overseas facility to produce the moulds.\n\n\u201cTsaigumi UAV, which is capable of day and night operations, has an operational endurance in excess of 10 hours, a service ceiling of 15,000 feet and a mission radius of 100km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 80kg and its payload comprises an electro-optical infrared camera system as well as weapon hard points. The Tsaigumi UAV, whose engine sound is muffled, has a state of the art encrypted communication system.\n\n\"It has a wingspan of 5.5metres and is able to gather real time weather information. On the contrary, the Gulma UAV has an operational endurance of 4 hours, a service ceiling of 5,000 feet and could not be operated beyond 20km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 40kg and its payload is an electro-optical camera system only. The Gulma UAV, whose engine sound is not muffled, relies on direct radio frequency communication system with attendant limitations.\n\n\u201cThe Gulma has a wingspan of 4.4 metres and relies on Air Traffic Control for weather information. Besides, while the Gulma UAV has an imported autopilot, the operational Tsaigumi UAV has an in-house developed autopilot. Tsaigumi UAV is thus a much more advanced and operationalized version of the earlier produced Amebo and Gulma UAV prototypes,\u201d he announced.\n\nAdesanya said the NAF is currently working on ICHOKU, which when completed, would be the first indigenous Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) in Nigeria."

    "text": "The Coast Guard\u2019s long-sought heavy icebreaker, the Polar Security Cutter, was among the programs to receive funding when Congress passed a spending package on late Thursday.\n\nThe Coast Guard is receiving $655 million to start construction on the lead ship for a new class of Polar Security Cutter and is receiving an addition $20 million to purchase long-lead-time materials for a second heavy icebreaker, as part of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations bill, Congressional staffers told USNI News.\n\nLast summer, the Senate had agreed to appropriate $755 million for the Polar Security Cutter. The House of Representatives, though, instead provided DHS with $5 billion to build a wall along the border with Mexico while canceling funding for a variety of programs including the Polar Security Cutter.\n\n\u201cWith the support of the administration and Congress, we plan to build a new fleet of six polar icebreakers \u2013 at least three of which must be heavy icebreakers \u2013 and we need the first new Polar Security Cutter immediately to meet America\u2019s needs in the Arctic,\u201d read a statement from the service provided to USNI News. \u201cThe United States is an Arctic nation with extensive national and global responsibilities. Our role in the Arctic is growing. Diminishing Arctic sea ice is expanding access to the region and attracting attention from both partner and rival states across the globe. Resource extraction, fisheries, tourism and commercial shipping, in conjunction with traditional Alaska native activities, are driving increased maritime activity and a greater need for Coast Guard presence in the region. America\u2019s only heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star, is more than 40 years old and must be replaced by the new Polar Security Cutter.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard has for several years pushed for funding the ice breaker program. Currently, the Coast Guard has only one operational heavy icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10), commissioned in 1976. A second icebreaker, USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11) has not been operational since a 2010 engine failure and instead has for nearly a decade served as a parts donor to keep Polar Star running, USNI News reported in 2017.\n\nFor years, having only one working heavy icebreaker hindered the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to satisfy mission requests from government agencies effectively. The Coast Guard was only able to fulfill 78 percent of heavy icebreaking missions between 2010 and 2016, according to a September 2017 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nHouse Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security member Rep David Price (D-N.C.) told USNI News that the new bill will start to build up what he sees as a critical U.S. capability.\n\n\u201cWith China and Russia showing increased interest in the Arctic region, the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic Strategy is more critical than ever to our national security,\u201d Price said in a statement to USNI News. For years, there has been a significant gap in our nation\u2019s icebreaking capabilities, and I\u2019m pleased the bipartisan FY19 omnibus bill includes funding to finally construct a new Polar Security Cutter, as well as money to begin purchasing long lead time materials for a second. The new Polar Security Cutter will ensure that our national security and economic interests are protected, that our marine vessels are provided safe passage, and that the United States has the ability to counter increased Russian aggression.\u201d"

    "text": "A fracas over a telephonic message from the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to Imran Khan on 23 August only added to the already strained relations between the US and its former South Asian ally. Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi contradicted the content of the call. The State Department had said in readout that during the call \u201cPompeo raised the importance of Pakistan taking decisive action against all terrorists operating in Pakistan\u201d. Islamabad refuted the US readout as incorrect, saying that this \u201cissue of terrorism\u201d was not discussed. However, when questioned by a reporter, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there would be no correction in response to Pakistan\u2019s complaint. \u201cI can only say we stand by our readout,\u201d\n\nMike Pompeo\u2019s message was preceded by the visit of Iranian foreign minister Zarif to Islamabad and Imran Khan Government\u2019s outright expression of support to Iranian stand in the face of Trump\u2019s threat to rescind the nuclear deal. Pakistani foreign minister\u2019s mind was also worked about the New Delhi visit of the US high-power delegation likely to take place after about a week of its visit to Islamabad. By raising the controversy Pakistan government wanted to give a message to the people that the US had taken the first initiative for rapprochement in bilateral relations that had begun to nosedive with the famous remark of Trump that \u201cwe gave billions of dollars to Pakistan and in return, they gave us lies and deceit.\u201d Qureshi\u2019s compulsion of distorting the factual message reflects discomfiture caused by Washington\u2019s insistence on \u201cdo more\u201d.\n\nPak Foreign Minister\u2019s attempt to dilute the content of the telephonic talk becomes meaningless when we focus on Pentagon\u2019s overview of Pak-US relations with reference to the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe denial could also be an attempt to dodge the closely guarded commitment that Pakistan army top brass might have made to their counterparts in Washington. What was the army top brass of the two sides talking about all these months? In a statement given at a briefing in the Pentagon the spokesman Mr Faulkner said \u201cSince January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan\u201d. Does Pakistan army now want to make the scapegoat of the civilian government for wriggling out of the broad frame of a formula worked out during these parleys for ending Afghan crisis?\n\nDays before Pompeo delegation\u2019s departure for Pakistan, Defence Secretary James Mattis said in a news briefing at the Pentagon that in their talks with Pakistani officials, the delegation will \u201cmake very clear what we have to do, all of our nations, in meeting our common foe, the terrorists, and make that a primary part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nEvidently, the issue at hand is Afghan war and Pakistan\u2019s hand in fuelling its flames. Noting that repeated warnings to Pakistan to deny safe haven to Afghan Taliban, particularly the Haqqani and Let networks fighting the US-led NATO forces have fallen on flat ears, Trump administration put into practice its three-point agenda of containing global terrorism with epicentre in Af-Pak region as was announced by him in his speech in Saudi Arabia last year. He earmarked three facets of US\u2019 new strategy for South Asia viz. (a) stripping terrorists of their territory (b) cutting off their funding and (c) exposing the false allure of their evil ideology. \u201cTerrorists are nothing but thugs, criminals and predators\u201d, he had concluded.\n\nReferring to Afghanistan and Pakistan in his Camp David speech last year, President Trump had underlined the basics of his strategy as (a) stopping resurgence of safe havens and (b) preventing nuclear weapons and materials being used against us or anywhere in the world. This very emphatically suggests that Trump administration\u2019s main concern is to find a mechanism that would deny the terrorist groups in Af-Pak region access to Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nTrump administration\u2019s indication of discouraging IMF to bail out Pakistan with 9 billion dollar loan from its crumbling financial crisis is in addition to the cancellation of US dollars 300 million aid to Pak army. The loud and clear warning has come on the eve of the visit to Islamabad of a high powered US government delegation. Pakistan foreign minister Qureshi is trying to minimize the adverse impact of the cancellation of a hefty amount of aid by raising flimsy technical issues. However, Lt. Col. Kone Faulkner, the Pentagon spokesman in an email to the AFP made clear why the US had blocked the amount of aid. He said, \u201cDue to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy\u2026 $300m (actually $323.6m to include non-Pakistan funds) was reprogrammed by the Defence Department in the June/July 2018 time frame for selected urgent priorities\u201d.\n\nThis statement touches on the essence of the irritants between the two countries. It found reverberation in the statement of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Joseph F. Dunford, who also had attended the Congressional briefing, that the US had \u201cpermanent interests in South Asia\u201d and wanted to \u201cmaintain a presence (there) to have influence in that region\u201d.\n\nIncidentally, General Dunford\u2019s inclusion in the delegation dispels the impression that this was not a proper visit but just a stopover, as US State and Defence Secretaries were both going to be in New Delhi next week for the first two-plus-two talks between the United States and India.\n\nThe \u201cpermanent interest in the region\u201d to which the American General was referring has to be understood by what President Trump expressed about dismantling of terrorist organizations active in Afghanistan-Pakistan region, and its threat to American interests. President Trump asserted that 9/11 had originated in that very region. A further clarification of the expression of interest is reflected more eloquently in how Trump looks at India in his vision of the new South Asian strategy. He had made a very clear and threadbare statement:\n\n\u201cAnother critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India\u2019s important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region\u201d.\n\nAt the Pentagon meeting Secretary Defence, Mattis said, \u201cWe see the strengthening of India\u2019s democracy, its military, its economy as a stabilising element in the world. And we want to make certain that where we have common interests, we are working together.\u201d\n\nThis is a paradigm shift in US\u2019 South Asia policy. In other words, US acknowledges the significance of India\u2019s role in stabilizing peace in the South Asian region where Afghanistan and Kashmir continue to be the zones of activity of terrorist organizations, particularly those that have been designated by the US or the UN. The first pillar of the new strategy in South Asia enunciated by President Trump and stated above is of \u201cstripping terrorists of their territory\u201d. This means chalking out of a joint strategy with frien0dly countries to deny space to the terrorists presently active in two conflict zones in South Asia. The message is clear and loud for all terrorist networks and their handlers as well as safe haven providers\n\nAs for the second pillar meaning \u201ccutting off their funding\u201d the Trump administration has taken two explicit steps viz. using its clout with IMF to obstruct bailing out Pakistan from financial crunch and cancellation of 300 million US dollar aid, a proposal waiting Congressional determination likely to come before the close of September.\n\nCuriously, Pakistani foreign minister Qureshi has disputed the $33b figure quoted by President Trump, insisting that around half of the money relates to reimbursements. His contention about the cancelled aid is that the payment, which the US is now considering scrapping, is, in fact, the support coalition fund. \u201cThis is not an aid of any kind that can be suspended,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is actually the payment of expenses incurred by us during the war against terrorism.\u201d However, forcefully rebutting Pakistan\u2019s contention, Pentagon spokesperson Faulkner analysed the US stand as this.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, recent reporting has distorted the details of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) by stating several things out of context. The suspension of security assistance to Pakistan was announced in January 2018. The CSF is included in the suspension and it remains in place. This is not a new decision or a new announcement, but an acknowledgement of a July request to reprogram funds before they expire. Reminding Pakistan that since January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan.\n\nHe made it clear that the US \u201ccontinues to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and LeT, and we continue to call on Pakistan to arrest, expel or bring the Taliban leadership to the negotiating table.\u201d Asserting that 2018 DoD Appropriations Act, published on March 23, details $500 million was rescinded by the Congress. He dismissed the Pakistani stand by arguing that owing to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy, the remaining $300 million was reprogrammed by the Department of Defence (DoD) in July 2018 time frame for other urgent priorities before the funds expire on September 30.\n\nIn final analysis the message brought to Islamabad by the US delegation boils down to this: Sever all links with Taliban terrorist groups including Haqqani and LeT networks; become our partner in new South Asian strategy of uprooting terrorism of all hues and in stabilizing peace in the region; ensure that nuclear weapon and material does not fall into the hands of terrorists. In return, we shall restore the process of giving the aid money and develop a sound partnership in bilateral trade and commerce.\n\nEvidently, Pakistan will make a deep study of the repercussions of dropping down the Haqqani and LeT networks as that would amount to the all-time departure from the policy of carving strategic space westward and eastward with focus on Afghanistan and Kashmir. Islamabad will also carefully study the outcome of the US high-level team\u2019s parleys with the Indians next week. Interestingly, New Delhi has done some advance spadework in J&K as a complement to the US\u2019 theorem of stripping terrorists of their territory. Dismissal of the PDP-led coalition government was part of cooperation for counter-terrorism. The continuation of the process will see the revival of the suspended assembly to prop up a government with far less commitment to the spectre of separatism and fundamentalism.\n\nIslamabad will closely watch to what extent the US high power delegation will gravitate to the Indian perception of terror phenomenon in South Asia. In the impending 2 + 2 meets in New Delhi, the status of Sino-Russian forays into South Asia and India-Pacific politics is likely to be the keynote subject for discussion. Remember that the Chinese foreign minister is expected to show up in Islamabad soon after the departure of the visiting US delegation."

Sometimes it is referred as the BREM-84. It is similar to modern Western ARVs. Typical tasks of the Atlet include recovery of damaged or overturned armored vehicles on the battlefield. It also provides maintenance service or tows them to maintenance units. The Atlet ARV was officially accepted to service with the Ukrainian Army in 2008. However only one vehicle was built. This armored recovery vehicle is also proposed for export customers. A small number of these ARVs (BREM-T) have been exported to Thailand. Recently some sources reported that Pakistan ordered 12 of these Ukrainian armored recovery vehicles alongside with 294 Oplot-M main battle tanks for delivery in 2018-2021.

It is fitted with a crane, winch and a front-mounted dozer. Crane of this armored recovery vehicle is hydraulically operated and can lift up to 25 t, which is adequate for most missions. The crane is installed on a rotary platform. It is capable of lifting the turret of most main battle tanks. It is also used to lift powerpacks of the MBTs, or for other load-lifting works. If repairs are required to a vehicle's suspension, the crane raises the front of back of the vehicle to allow access to the damaged system. When not required the crane lays along the right side of the hull. The main mechanical winch is provided with 130 m of cable and has a traction force of 25 t. With the help of pulley blocks traction force is increased to 50 and 75 t. The main winch is used for recovery of damaged, stuck, sunken and overturned vehicles. There is also an auxiliary winch with 260 m of cable and a traction force of 900 kg. It is used for delivery of the main winch rope and other cargo handling operations. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle tows damaged, faulty or uncontrolled vehicles, or similar type tanks using rigid or non-rigid hitches. Vehicles are towed to the nearest shelters, assembly points of repair depots. Vehicle has a welding outfit for welding and cutting works in the field. These are carried by one of the crew member. The Atlet also has a set of tools for field repairs. The front-mounted dozer blade is used for clearing obstacles and earth-mowing works, such as preparation of firing positions, covering up of ditches, self-entrenching and so on. Capacity of earth-mowing works in clay terrain is 120 m\u00b3/h. The dozer blade is also used to stabilize the vehicle during craning and winching operations. The Atlet ARV has a required level of protection to operate alongside the frontline units. Front arc withstands small-caliber projectile hits, while all-round protection is against heavy machine gun fire and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle is fitted with NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. This armored recovery vehicle is armed with remotely controlled 12.7 mm machine gun. It is used for self-defense against ground and low-flying air targets. A total of 450 rounds are carried for this machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle has a crew of three, including commander, driver and handler. There is a special cargo platform at the hull rear. It is used to transport spare engine, gearboxes, spare parts, cargo, additional fuel or other equipment with a total weight up to 1.5 t. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle is proposed with two engine options. The basic is a 6TD turbocharged diesel engine, developing 1 000 hp. A more powerful 6TD-2 engine, developing 1 200 hp, is also available. This armored recovery vehicle is also fitted with auxiliary power unit. It ensures operation of the add-on equipment, such as welding equipment, auxiliary winch and other electric equipment of the vehicle, when the main engine is turned off. With a deep wading kit this ARV fords water obstacles up to 5 m deep. When not in use this deep wading kit is stored on top of the roof. The Atlet ARV can be airlifted by the An-124 or similar heavy cargo aircraft. Variants BREM-T is a similar armored recovery vehicle with some minor changes to meet specific Thai Army requirements, such as a different radio, air conditioner and so on. . It was specially developed to meet a Thai Army requirement. It was revealed in 2013. It is based on the Oplot-M chassis and is designed to support these main battle tanks. Thailand ordered a total of 49 Oplot-M tanks and required a dedicated ARV to support them. Can't find what you're looking for?"

    "text": "A remote Iranian port could be the next trigger for geopolitical tensions between rivals China and India. India has pledged more than $500 million to develop the strategically located port of Chabahar -- roughly 1,800 kilometers (1,110 miles) from the capital Tehran -- since it first expressed interest in 2003. Yet repeated delays have prompted Iran to turn to China in the hope of speeding up construction.On a March trip to Islamabad , Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he\u2019d welcome Chinese and Pakistani investment in Chabahar, according to Dawn newspaper. He cited China\u2019s development of Gwadar, a port down the coast that is a showcase of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt-and-Road infrastructure initiative.The shift makes sense for Iran, which wants to ensure Chabahar is an economic success. But it could be a strategic loss for India, which opposes China\u2019s expansion in the Indian Ocean and is already worried that Gwadar could one day be used as a military base -- along with other China-backed ports from Myanmar to Bangladesh to Sri Lanka.Any formal investment from Beijing would further weaken the strategic advantage for New Delhi to invest in Chabahar, which is close to Pakistan\u2019s western border. The Gwadar port is part of Xi\u2019s plan to finance $50 billion in infrastructure investments in Pakistan , and Chinese merchants already have a strong foothold in Chabahar.China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"Delhi would likely take the view that any Chinese presence at Chabahar, even if not involved in the operation of the port, could be used as a way of undermining India\u2019s influence with local authorities,\" said David Brewster, a senior research fellow with the Australian National University\u2019s National Security College. \"It could also be potentially used to facilitate surveillance of India\u2019s activities.\"While it\u2019s unclear whether China will take up Iran\u2019s offer, the involvement of a cash-rich and expansionist Beijing would almost certainly speed up development of the port.China has overland train connections linking China to Iran and \u201chuge\u201d investments in the country, said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think-tank. \"China is much deeper there than India.\"Iran\u2019s invitation to invest was welcomed in Pakistan. \"It\u2019s a positive statement that came for the first time from their side,\" Dostain Khan Jamaldini, chairman of the Gwadar Port Authority, said by phone. The two countries are already discussing a new ferry service that would link ports in Gwadar and Karachi with the Iranian ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas, Jamaldini said.Cooperation between the two ports could be awkward. India and Pakistan are historic foes that have fought several wars, while India and China -- which recently faced off in the Himalayas -- are battling for geopolitical influence in South Asia.Still, for Iran the port\u2019s development is important. It will be a vital trading hub in the Gulf of Oman, said Ebrahim Jamili, head of the Iran-India Chamber of Commerce in Tehran.\"The priority is with the Indians -- they\u2019ve been involved and came forward first,\" Jamili said. \"But if another investor comes along and is interested in Chabahar, there is certainly enough space and opportunity for them and for their investment.\"While there\u2019s been talks on Chinese and Pakistani involvement, Jamili said Pakistan is not a serious contender in terms of investment.India first agreed to help Iran expand Chabahar port in 2003, constructing two terminals -- a multipurpose cargo terminal and a container terminal. Progress slowed particularly as Western nations imposed sanctions on Iran, which were lifted in 2015. Delays have persisted since then, including a two-year dispute over whether India would pay $30 million of excise duties on port equipment imported into Iran.Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Monday construction was going well and both sides were meeting regularly. He was unable to give a completion date.\"Significant progress\" has been made at Chabahar, Kumar said, noting it was Iran\u2019s \"prerogative\" to choose its partners.Cooperation with China would help Iran to relieve its financial situation and promote infrastructure development, said Yang Guang, a researcher on international relations with state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\"China and Iran, as increasingly important economic forces on the international stage, have great potential for cooperation,\u201d Yang said."

    "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."

    "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - Just one day after signing a $233 million agreement to sell 16 helicopters to the Philippines, the Canadian government on Wednesday ordered a review of the deal amid concerns the aircraft could be used to fight rebels.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Canada's Minister of international trade Francois-Philippe Champagne speaks during an interview with Reuters in Danang, Vietnam November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nTrade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that the deal - formally signed on Tuesday - had been struck in 2012 on the understanding the helicopters would be used for search-and-rescue missions.\n\nPhilippine Major-General Restituto Padilla, military chief of plans, told Reuters on Tuesday the helicopters would be used for the military\u2019s internal security operations, adding they could also be deployed in search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw that declaration ... we immediately launched a review with the relevant authorities. And we will obviously review the facts and take the right decision,\u201d Champagne told reporters, without giving more details.\n\nThe Bell 412EPI helicopters were due be delivered early next year as the Philippine military prepares to step up operations against Islamist and communist rebels.\n\nPhilippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana initially expressed bemusement at news of Canada reviewing the deal.\n\nHe later issued a statement that the helicopters would primarily be used for the transporting and supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers and for humanitarian assistance and disaster response.\n\n\u201cThey are not attack or close support aircraft,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cWhile they may be used in support of Internal Security Operations ... their role is limited to those that I mentioned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShould the Canadian government choose to discontinue their sale of the aircraft to us, then we will procure them from another source.\u201d\n\nCLEAR REGULATIONS\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, asked later whether he was concerned the helicopters might be used against Filipino citizens, replied \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nCanada has very clear regulations about to whom it can sell weapons and how they can be used, he said during a question and answer event at the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure before this deal or any other deal goes through that we are abiding by the rules ... that Canadian governments have to follow,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte publicly criticized Trudeau at a regional summit in Manila for raising questions about his war on drugs, calling it an \u201cofficial insult\u201d, adding that he \u201cwould not answer to any other bullshit, especially (from) foreigners\u201d.\n\nNearly 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in the campaign since June 2016. Human rights groups accuse police of carrying out illegal killings, staging crime scenes and falsifying reports, a charge they deny.\n\n\u201cHuman rights is a key element of our foreign policy and of our trade policy,\u201d said Champagne.\n\nIn 2016, the Liberal government was criticized for deciding to honor a contract to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite human rights concerns. Like the helicopter contract, the deal had been arranged by Canada\u2019s former Conservative administration.\n\nPhilippine defense ministry spokesman, Arsenio Andolong, said it was \u201cunfair to equate internal security operations in general with human rights violations\u201d or to cast judgment on the military when allegations were unverified.\n\nHe did not specify what the allegations or violations were, or who had made them."

    "text": "Government of Trinidad & Tobago Announces Future Acquisition of Two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats\n\n(Source: Austal; issued July 29, 2018)\n\nAustal Limited (Austal) is pleased to report that the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) has announced its intention to purchase two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats. The vessels will enhance the border protection capabilities of the country in conjunction with the existing Coast Guard fleet, and will join six Austal Fast Patrol Craft acquired in 2009.\n\n\n\nThis announcement is further to a comprehensive proposal submitted by Austal to GORTT in recent weeks. The sale is likely to be supported by the Australian Government via the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), and follows a demonstration by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) of the capabilities of the Cape Class vessel to a delegation of senior Trinidad and Tobago officials, which included the Chief of Defence Staff.\n\n\n\nThe order is likely to be valued at circa AU$100m plus a multi-year ongoing maintenance and support package. Austal expects to establish a Service Centre in Trinidad to support these vessels, the Austal supplied Fast Patrol Craft, and any additional vessels requiring maintenance as determined by GORTT.\n\n\n\nThe new Cape Class vessels will be built in Austal\u2019s Henderson shipyard based in Western Australia. Austal have already built 10 Cape Class vessels in Henderson for the Australian Border Force and RAN. Delivery is expected to be in mid-2020.\n\n\n\nDesigned and built by Austal, the Cape Class is a 58 metre all aluminium monohull patrol boat specifically produced to combat the full range of maritime security threats. The vessel has a long 4000 nautical mile range and 28-day patrol cycle with a crew of up to 22. The vessel also supports two high speed 7.3 metre Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats used for intercepting other vessels.\n\n\n\nGORTT have requested that the purchase be supported by an EFIC finance package which will be developed specifically to support the program, for which EFIC have already supplied a letter of support. The sale of the vessels is conditional on final contracts being signed in the coming weeks, together with a conclusive offer from EFIC to GORTT. It is expected that an initial, lower value design contract will be signed shortly to hasten preparations for the main contract and ensure that the delivery schedule will be maintained.\n\n\n\nThese vessels will be the latest additions to the work already scheduled in the Henderson facility, including a 109 metre catamaran for Molslinjen of Denmark, 21 Pacific Patrol Boats (PPB), currently in build, and a 117 metre trimaran for Fred Olsen S.A. of the Canary Islands which will commence construction in August 2018.\n\n\n\nThese additional build programs will keep the local workforce active at the current level until 2021 (2023 for PPB), one of the longest forward order books seen at Austal for a decade or more.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n\n\n"

According to the information we presently have at hand, those helicopters are not U.S.-made, but rather manufactured by a number of states with an American license,\u201d the spokesman said, adding they were intended for non-military use.\n\nTouching upon the recent Azerbaijani provocations along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, in the direction of Nakhichevan, Mr Balayan noted that the country acts upon the principle of irresponsibility, failing to fulfil the commitments undertaken by it.\n\n\u201cWe keep voicing this issue both before the [OSCE Minsk Group] co-chairing countries and our remaining partner states and organizations. I believe the co-chairs have a serious work to do here since Azerbaijan disregards the co-chairing countries by ignoring their calls and doing completely the opposite,\u201d he added."

PHOTO | FILE\n\nBy NEVILLE OTUKI\n\nMore by this Author Summary Treasury secretary Henry Rotich made the top-ups through a mini-budget that is awaiting Parliament approval.\n\nThe KDF had recently gone slow on acquisition of weapons as neighbouring Uganda made a strong comeback to lead in East Africa\u2019s arms race.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) last month revealed that Kenya slashed its spending on military hardware by half to Sh1.3 billion ($13 million) in 2017 from Sh2.8 the previous year.\n\nThe military has been added Sh9 billion for weapons acquisition, positioning the Kenyan army for a bullish entry into the global arms market following a lull that saw Uganda overtake it in arsenal spending last year.\n\nTreasury secretary Henry Rotich made the top-ups through a mini-budget that is awaiting Parliament approval.\n\nOf the Sh9 billion army cash, Sh7.4 billion will be for arms stockpiles and the remaining Sh1.6 billion for personnel emoluments in the period to June 30, as the current financial year comes to an end.\n\nMr Rotich last September also sought MPs\u2019 approval for budget top-ups by Sh1.8 billion for the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), coinciding with the period when the country was gripped by a prolonged election.\n\nREAD: Uganda tops arms race as Kenya halves to Sh1.3bn\n\nALSO READ: US gives Kenya six boats to help boost war on terrorism\n\nMORE: Court gives auditor-general free hand to audit military spending\n\nStrong comeback\n\nThe KDF had recently gone slow on acquisition of weapons as neighbouring Uganda made a strong comeback to lead in East Africa\u2019s arms race.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) last month revealed that Kenya slashed its spending on military hardware by half to Sh1.3 billion ($13 million) in 2017 from Sh2.8 the previous year.\n\nUganda on the other hand ended its lull with its last year\u2019s arms stockpile worth Sh1.8 billion, a departure from 2016 when it made nil purchase. In 2017, Tanzania did not make any purchase.\n\nTanzania\u2019s non-action in the global arms market came amid austerity plan by President John Magufuli who is pushing for cuts in expenditure deemed non-essential.\n\nNairobi\u2019s arms orders last year included a second-hand naval gun, AK-630 30mm, from Montenegro \u201cfor modernisation of Jasiri OPV (offshore patrol vessel),\u201d the Sipri report says."

    "text": "LONDON \u2015 Britain\u2019s defense secretary has put at least a \u00a33 billion-a-year (U.S. $4 billion) price tag on the value of the country\u2019s close military relationship with the US, but conceded that the arrangement was priceless to the government.\n\n\u201cWe benefit massively from our relationship with the U.S. I said you couldn\u2019t actually put a price on it, but when you look at [it] in terms of the benefits we get on a yearly basis I think we would benefit to the tune of a very minimum of \u00a33 billion, and that is taking a very conservative approach,\u201d Gavin Williamson told the parliamentary Defence Committee on Tuesday.\n\nWilliamson said the benefits came in \u201cterms of technology, in terms of joint programs working together. Quite frankly we would always struggle to put that level of investment into a program if we wanted to bring it to fruition, so we are a massive beneficiary of this relationship.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come as the committee concluded an inquiry into British relations with the U.S. and NATO. The findings of the report are expected to be published in the next few months.\n\nThe defense secretary earlier in the day announced the Ministry of Defence had on May 21 hosted a meeting with the U.S. Defense Innovation Board in London aimed at sharing, among other things, innovation priorities.\n\nBritain\u2019s relationship with the U.S. could take a serious hit, however, should media reports from last week prove true \u2015 that London is considering cutting its pledge to buy 138 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets and instead purchase more of the cheaper Eurofighter Typhoons as part of its defense review, officially known as the Defence Modernisation Programme.\n\nOne British newspaper described the possible move as \u201can epic snub\u201d to Washington.\n\nWilliamson also announced Britain\u2019s investment in the creation of what will be called the AI Lab \u2015 a defense center for artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science based at the MoD\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory facility in Porton Down, southwest England.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith the cash-strapped MoD expected to publish the defense review ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels scheduled for July 11, lawmakers wanted to know whether Washington had voiced an opinion about British defense spending.\n\nWilliamson said the U.S. Defense Department and others in the states had contributed to the defense review, but the subject of money hadn\u2019t been on the agenda formally or informally.\n\n\u201cWhat they have asked is to make sure we have the right capabilities. But we have not had a discussion about defense spending. ... They have put a very high value on the capabilities we have, and they would be very concerned to see that capability eroded,\u201d Williamson told the committee.\n\nThe defense secretary specifically noted \u201cmassive ticket items that the U.S. sees as pivotal for the defense and security of NATO members\u201d:\n\nRapid deployment of troops as part of NATO.\n\nSpecial forces.\n\nThe new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier battle group.\n\n\n\nThe nuclear deterrent.\n\n\n\nCountering the uptick in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic.\n\n\n\nWilliamson also mentioned the Royal Navy\u2019s mine-hunting capabilities and said Britain is a world leader in terms of technological development done in partnership with the U.S., asserting that in some cases the U.S. is further behind Britain.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, senior U.S. military and diplomatic figures voiced concern over Britain\u2019s declining defense capabilities as spending slipped close to falling below the NATO-set spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThey [the U.S. administration] recognize that our commitment to 2 percent is something to be praised and is an important signal to other European nations to be spending at that same level,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nEarlier this month, Woody Johnson, the U.S. ambassador in London, urged Britain to increase its defense spending.\n\n\n\nThe Defence Modernisation Programme is meant to prioritize British capabilities and programs, in part to reflect the rapidly changing threat posed by Russia and others since the Strategic Defence and Security Review was published in 2015.\n\nThe MoD, which is facing a multibillion pound black hole in the defense equipment and other budgets over the next few years, will have to find significant cuts from efficiency gains and other measures to balance the books. The department is also fighting for more money from the Treasury to stave off cuts.\n\nDefense funding problems took a new knock Tuesday when the National Audit Office, a government-spending watchdog, warned that the program to design, build and support nuclear submarines over the next 10 years faces a \u00a36 billion funding gap."

    "text": "Turkey won\u2019t strike a deal on purchasing American-made Patriot air defense missile systems if the US ties it with tearing up the existing arms contract with Moscow, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u201cThe S-400 deal has already been finalized. We can agree with the US on the Patriot system, but not if there will be [a condition] to abandon the S-400s,\u201d the minister stated on Thursday, as quoted by NTV.\n\nAlso on rt.com US tells Turkey to give up on Russian S-400s in exchange for Patriot systems deal \u2013 report\n\nTurkish media reported earlier that the contract presented by the Americans says the missiles will only be delivered if Ankara abandons the S-400 purchase.\n\nThe US Department of State approved the sale of 80 Patriot missiles and 60 PAC-3 missile interceptors last month. Cavusoglu confirmed that Ankara received a formal proposal to buy the weapons and will consider the terms. But in no way should Washington attempt to meddle in the nation\u2019s arms deals with other partners, the minister warned.\n\nNATO allies can get whatever air defense systems they want.\n\nThe deal to buy Russia\u2019s advanced S-400 air defense missile system was signed by Ankara last year following lengthy negotiations. The first batch of S-400s is scheduled to be deployed in October.\n\nAlerted by the Russian-Turkish talks, officials in Washington unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade its ally from dealing with Moscow. Last year, Congress passed a law effectively blocking the shipment of 100 F-35 jet fighters to Turkey. Lawmakers cited the risks that the sale of S-400s poses to the US and NATO.\n\nUS diplomats and military officials similarly tried to pressure India out of buying the S-400 as the transaction could potentially violate American laws on sanctions placed on Russia. According to local media, Washington even proposed granting New Delhi a free pass on receiving arms from Moscow if it also buys the US\u2019 F-16 aircraft.\n\nDespite pressure from overseas, Turkey and India maintained that they can freely choose partners in the arms trade without interference from Washington or anybody else. \u201cWe don\u2019t need permission from anybody\u201d to purchase the S-400s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in September.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

According to manufacturer BAE Systems, which also has the contract to modernize Latvia's vehicles, 23 countries have bought a total of 3,500 of the vehicles since 1972.\n\nAn interesting history of the vehicles and details of some previous purchasers is found at the Army Guide website.\n\nWith Latvia due to increase its defense spending to NATO's recommended minimum level of 2% of GDP by 2018, more money is certainly going to be spent on procurement, with a corresponding need for scrutiny to make sure it is being spent in the most efficient way.\n\nThe deal has come under fresh scrutiny after Lithuania last week announced its largest ever defense purchase: \u20ac386 million to buy 88 brand new German 'Boxer' armored fighting vehicles.\n\nIf you fancy some military hardware of your own, the British Ministry of Defense has plenty of pre-loved vehicles available at bargain prices - though to collectors rather than allied powers needing rapid mechanization and combat capability."

The eight, collectively valued at R268 969 122, are the forerunners of the Badger, the SA Army\u2019s new infantry fighting vehicle being built by Denel Land Systems.\n\nAs far as heavy weapons are concerned the report notes the import of 16 cannon, worth R19 989 941, from Switzerland; 12 84 mm weapons, worth R4 867 196, from the Peoples Republic of China; 46 grenade launchers (R183 847) from the United States and two Swiss sniper rifles (R167 015).\n\nFrom China, the import of 13 missile launchers worth R1.2 million was approved, as well as two missile launchers from the United States worth R1.3 million. A single mortar system was acquired from Spain, for R362 000.\n\nOn the ammunition front South Africa imported thousands of rounds ranging in calibre from 40mm to 338, 30mm and 7.62 mm as well as 400 specialist rounds for sniper rifles. All told the value of ammunition is over R186 million. The majority of this was for 21 000 rounds of 40 mm ammunition from Bulgaria, worth R175 million. Other large ammunition contracts were awarded to Norway (2 000 30 mm rounds worth R8 million) and Switzerland (1 000 20 mm rounds worth R1.3 million).\n\nOther imports noted in the report include five simulators from Switzerland (R2.4 million); communications equipment from Germany (R69 million); communications equipment from the United States (R65 million); and cameras, thermal imagers and other optics from France, Belgium, Canada and Germany worth a total of R48 million. The 51 thermal imagers from France (worth R46 million) were probably for the Badger infantry fighting vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the NCACC granted 2 245 import permits from 74 countries in the 2016 calendar year. For the 2015 calendar year, the NCACC authorised 2 249 import permits covering 74 countries worth R502 million. This compares to R200 million in 2014.\n\n"

In a joint statement issued at the time, it was specified that \u201cthe ships will be built by the French high-tech company, Naval Group, in partnership with Abu Dhabi Ship Building Company (ADSB).\u201d\n\nThe contract is significant for Naval Group, given it has never sold anything to the UAE.\n\nThe Gowind corvettes are powered by engines made by Germany\u2019s MTU, meaning Berlin could make the contract difficult to honor. The government is not delivering licenses to export military materiel to either Saudi Arabia or the UAE over their involvement in the war in Yemen and the resulting humanitarian crisis there.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s 2,700-ton corvettes will be equipped with Naval Group\u2019s SETIS combat management system, MBDA\u2019s Exocet missile and Raytheon\u2019s Evolved Seasparrow Missile. It was initially announced that Abu Dhabi would procure the Thales Tacticos combat management system.\n\nThe Emirates News Agency, WAM, interviewed Naval Group CEO Herv\u00e9 Guillou in February during the IDEX 2019 defense conference in Abu Dhabi, and it quoted him as saying that \u201csince the announcement of the deal in 2017, we have been discussing with the UAE authorities to take into account their specific requirements and to provide them with the best answer to their operational need.\u201d\n\nAccording to WAM, the executive also said that \u201cin the frame of the program, Naval Group envisions to transfer technologies and know-how to UAE institutions and to the naval ecosystem, thus developing national sovereign capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

    "text": "Senegal and the Ivory Coast are buying CN235 and NC-212 aircraft from PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) for transport and maritime surveillance duties.\n\nA framework agreement was signed last week during the Indonesia-Africa Forum held in Indonesia between 10 and 11 April. The agreement is worth $75 million and covers the supply of two NC-212-200 maritime surveillance aircraft and a CN235-220 maritime patrol aircraft to Senegal and a CN235-220 to the Ivory Coast for transport.\n\nThe agreement was signed with Belgian company AD Trade Belgium, which is facilitating the deals with Senegal and the Ivory Coast.\n\nPTDI (Indonesian Aerospace) President Director Elfien Goentoro said \u201cthe African market is promising, as it comprises several countries. Geographically, African countries and Indonesia have similarities, so they need several light and medium turboprop aircraft.\u201d\n\nGoentoro said the contracts will be firmed up in July this year and the aircraft delivered in two and a half years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cWe are offering countries in Africa the development of human resource skills and knowledge in the aircraft manufacturing industry,\u201d Goentoro added, saying there are opportunities for African countries regarding upgrades, modifications and maintenance and overhaul of CN235 and NC212 aircraft.\n\nIn December 2016 PTDI delivered a CN235-220 transport aircraft to Senegal\u2019s Air Force. It was ordered in November 2014 via AD Trade Belgium. The aircraft is in a quick change configuration that allows it to be used for paratrooping, medical evacuation, VIP and passenger transport missions.\n\nThis was followed by Senegal\u2019s order in August 2017 for a single CN235-220 for maritime patrol, again through AD Trade Belgium.\n\nBurkina Faso and Guinea have also ordered CN235s \u2013 the Burkina Faso deal for two CN235s was facilitated by PTDI and AD Trade Belgium. Guinea\u2019s single CN235 was acquired from Senegal, which had previously acquired two second-hand aircraft from Indonesia.\n\nPTDI said its maritime patrol aircraft are able to carry out a wide range of missions, such as border patrol, Exclusive Economic Zone monitoring, fisheries policing, pollution monitoring, search and rescue and combating human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nThe aircraft CN235-220 MPA variant has an endurance of 10-11 hours and features a more modern full-glass avionics cockpit system, autopilot, and winglets for better performance and economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CN235-220 MPA aircraft can be fitted with a 360-degree search radar that can detect small targets up to 200 nautical miles away, forward-looking infrared as well as an Automatic Identification System (AIS), and automatic tracking system."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nA Parliamentary panel is concerned about India\u2019s declining defence expenditure \u2014 which is at 1.56% of GDP in 2017-18, down from 2.6% in 2014-15 \u2014 and said the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d in a two-front war.\n\nNew Delhi: A parliamentary committee has taken exception to the low defence expenditure in India, noting that, in the current geo-political scenario, the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d on the question of preparedness for a two-front war.\n\nIt has also expressed concern about the slow rate of increase in indigenisation in the defence sector, and noted that \u201cnothing concrete has been done for implementation of the strategic partnership model\u201d unveiled in May last year.\n\nThese observations are part of the estimates committee\u2019s draft report on \u2018Preparedness of Armed Forces: Defence Production and Procurement\u2019.\n\nMembers of Parliament privy to the deliberations told ThePrint that the committee, headed by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, is perturbed about the fact that India\u2019s defence expenditure, at 1.56 per cent of the GDP in 2017-18 \u2014 down from 2.6 per cent in 2014-15 \u2014 is at its lowest since the 1962 Sino-Indian war.\n\nFrom the data made available to the committee, it was found that defence expenditure had marginally increased since 2014-15, but when compared to the central government\u2019s expenditures, the percentage decreased from 13.15 in 2014-15 to 12.2 in 2017-18.\n\nAccording to a study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which conducts research on global security, the defence expenditure, as a share of the GDP, of China and France had remained the same, increased in case of Saudi Arabia and Russia and decreased in case of the US and the UK in the last decade (2007-2017).\n\nHowever, the estimates committee says in its draft report, keeping in view the scale of GDP of the developed countries, the decrease of India\u2019s defence expenditure as a percentage of the GDP is \u201cmore noticeable\u201d.\n\n\u2018Allocations unacceptable\u2019\n\nThe estimates committee is also \u201cunhappy\u201d about the \u201cabysmally low\u201d share of capital expenditure as a percentage of the total defence spend, which has been continuously declining over the years \u2014 from 39 per cent in 2013-14 to 33 per cent in 2017-18.\n\n\u201cWhat is more worrisome is the situation whereby the procurement has to be adjusted as per the budgetary allocations made by the government, which are not in keeping with the requirements projected as per the long-term integrated perspective plan (LTIPP)\u2026\u201d an MP told ThePrint.\n\n\u201cThe committee finds the present situation unacceptable whereby the allocations are not being made according to the LTIPP, thereby defeating the purpose of having long-term defence plans,\u201d the MP said.\n\nBefore finalising the report, the panel is likely to call the defence minister for deposition, the MP added.\n\nIn 2014-15 and 2015-16, the allocations made at the budgetary-estimates stage consistently got reduced at the revised-estimates level and even the reduced allocations could not be utilised fully. The committee members were, therefore, \u201cnot able to appreciate\u201d the remarks of the secretary, defence acquisition, during the course of deposition that \u201cthey hear from the department of defence that the requirement of the forces is very high and the fund allocation to that extent is not there\u201d.\n\nWhere\u2019s the PPP?\n\nAccording to another MP, the committee is likely to recommend that defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) be given \u201cadequate autonomy and resources\u201d to enable them to operate on commercial basis and sell their products to global customers without depending on the government.\n\n\u201cIn case of conflict, the demands of the national armed forces have to be given primacy,\u201d the committee is learnt to have said in its draft report.\n\nNotwithstanding the government\u2019s constant refrain about public-private partnership in defence, the committee, said a member, has found that \u201cthere is no existing mechanism\u201d to facilitate it in the defence sector.\n\n\u201cThe strategic-partnership model formulated for defence production does not specify a clear role for major defence PSUs. There seems to be a total lack of coordination among government agencies insofar as integrated approach to public-private partnership in defence sector is concerned,\u201d said another member, quoting from the report.\n\nDRDO hauled up\n\nIn its draft report, the committee has come down heavily on the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), saying it has \u201cnot been able to meet the nation\u2019s expectation\u201d.\n\nIn 2015, the Comptroller & Auditor General of India reported that 14 mission-mode projects carried out by DRDO laboratories had failed to achieve their timelines and the probable date of completion was extended many a time.\n\nThese mission-mode projects pertained to the S-band surveillance system, Rohini radars, secure video and fax communication between airborne platforms and ground station Meghdoot and electronic warfare suit for the modified MiG-29 fighters.\n\nA high-powered defence committee said that at least 11 laboratories of the DRDO need to be closed down. The estimates committee has pointed out in its draft report that the functioning of DRDO needs a major overhaul and its contribution in the context of the country\u2019s requirements needs to be re-examined.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

The Kenyan Air Force roundel can be seen on one of the helicopters. The publication said the aircraft were acquired from the UAE and their grey paint scheme matches those of UAE aircraft.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Army Aviation Brigade and the Air Force\u2019s Special Operations Command operate a number of AS550C3 Fennec helicopters but little is known about them.\n\nIf confirmed, the Fennecs appear to be the latest in a series of procurements. In June this year it emerged that Kenya had ordered three Leonardo C-27J Spartan transport aircraft from Italy in 2017, with deliveries in 2019, most likely replacing its de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenya also ordered a number of AW139 helicopters in a separate deal and in December last year displayed two second hand AH-1F Cobra attack helicopters acquired from Jordan.

A new timetable is expected by the end of the year, which would stem the financial charges of \u20ac8.5 billion (U.S. $10.5 billion) booked by Airbus.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

(Remy de la Mauviniere/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome of the Seville staff could be switched to retrofit of military capabilities on the A400M. The Spanish plant also works on the C-295 tactical turboprop plane and provides aircraft maintenance and repairs.\n\nThe total 3,700 job cuts will fall on 13 factories across the four partner nations, with the company expecting to assign most of the staff to other aircraft programs.\n\nA lower production rate for the A400M seeks to address the problem of the number of aircraft built but then parked on the tarmac rather than promptly delivered to client nations. That excess of inventory arose from the need to fix a problem on the propeller gearbox of the TP400 engine.\n\nSlower production also allows Airbus more time to fit equipment for tactical capabilities rather than deliver the aircraft on time and later recall them for retrofit.\n\nAirbus also expects to use that extra time to pitch the plane in export markets.\n\nA January order from Dubai-based airline Emirates for 20 A380s, with an option for 16 more, gave a lifeline for the double-decker airliners with an annual baseline delivery of six units. That Emirates order was worth $16 billion at list price, though it was likely the airline won a large discount."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nLast month, the Russian military took delivery of a new S-400 Triumf advanced Air Defense System (NATO reporting name: SA-21 Growler) regiment, according to local media reports. It is the second S-400 regiment to be inducted into the ranks of the Russian Army in 2016 and will further boost Russia\u2019s so called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capability. (S-400 units have so far been deployed to Kaliningrad along the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea region, Syria covering the eastern Mediterranean Sea, as well as in Russia\u2019s Far East.)\n\nThree additional S-400 regiments are slated for delivery by the end of 2016, according to an official in the Russian defense industry, which will bring up the total number of S-400 regiments to 16. One S-400 regiment is divided into two battalions. Each battalion consists of eight launchers and 32 missiles in addition to acquisition and engagement radar systems and a command post.\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, the S-300, the S-400 air defense system features an improved radar system and updated software; it can purportedly can fire four new types of surface-to-air (SAM) missiles in addition to the S-300\u2019s 48N6E, a vertical tube launched, solid fuel, single stage SAM with an estimated range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and the improved 48N6E2 missile with a reported range of 195 kilometers (121 miles).\n\nOne of the S-400\u2019s new missiles is the so-called 40N6 SAM with an estimated operational range of 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) and an altitude of up to 185 kilometers (607,000 feet). The missile is reportedly capable of exo-atmospheric interception of intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads in their terminal phase. However, it is unclear whether the weapon is operational in Russia yet and no images of the 40N6 SAM have surfaced so far.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe S-400 is also armed with an improved variant of the 48N6E2 with an alleged range of 250 kilometers (160 miles). The air defense system can also fire two additional missiles, the 9M96E and 9M96E2 with respective ranges of 40 km (25 miles) and 120 km (75 miles). Improved S-300 air defense systems such as the S-300PMU-2 Favorite (sold to Iran), can purportedly also fire the 9M96E and 9M96E2.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nThe S-400 can purportedly fire missiles at a rate 2.5 times faster than its predecessor, the S-300. It can engage stand-off jammer aircraft, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, and both ballistic and cruise missiles in an electronic countermeasures environment. Russia is also working on a newer long-range air defense system, the S-500 Prometheus, which will specifically be designed to intercept up to ten ballistic missiles simultaneously."

Apart from this counter-balancing, India is also stepping-up military ties with the third pole, China, amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.\u201cIndia has been a latestarter in defence diplomacy but is now making all-out efforts despite budgetary, bureaucratic and other constraints. Indian Navy warships, for instance, have made 113 foreign port calls and held 16 exercises/coordinated patrols with different navies this year,\u201d said a senior defence official.In fact, by the time this year ends, India would have held exercises with all the P-5 countries (US, Russia, China, France and UK), apart from other powerhouses like Australia, Japan, South Africa and Brazil as well as Asean countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. \u201cI don\u2019t think any other country has held such a staggering number of exercises with so many nations this year. The exercises promote strategic cooperation, military outreach, confidence-building and interoperability,\u201d said the official.In December alone, the Indian armed forces have chalked up a hectic schedule for exercises with the US, Russia and China, among others. First off the block will be the \u201cCope India\u201d between the Indian and American air forces at the Kalaikunda and Arjan Singh airbases in West Bengal from December 3 to 14.While the IAF is deploying its fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s as well as other aircraft like Phalcon AWACS, C-130Js and IL-78 refuelers, the USAF has dispatched 12 F-15 jets and three C-130H planes for Cope India.Next, the IAF and Russian Air Force will conduct the second leg of their \u201cAviaIndra\u201d exercise at Jodhpur from December 10 to 22 after the first was held at Lipetsk in Russia in September. India and China, in turn, will resume their annual \u201cHand-in-Hand\u201d land exercise at Chengdu military region from December 10 to 23 after the freeze due to the Doklam troop stand-off near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year.That\u2019s not all. Russian warships will head for India\u2019s east coast to hold the \u201cIndra\u201d wargames towards end-December, even as the Indo-UK \u201cKonkan\u201d naval exercise is currently underway off Goa."

The transition is back and at this very minute is exercising the power of the state,\u201d said Kafando, reported local media.\n\nBurkina Faso's government has been in a precarious state since last week when the presidential guard took over the palace and detained the interim President Michel Kafando and Prime Minister Yacouba Isaac Zida. The following day, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, the head of the presidential guard, declared himself the country's new leader.\n\nThe move was met with resistance by citizens, which led to violent protests in the street. It was also condemned by the Burkina Faso military and other government loyalists, as well as the international community, including the African Union.\n\nArmy loyalists gave Diendere an ultimatum Monday, telling him to step down or face a military attack.\n\nA deal was signed late Tuesday between the two sides. Diendere agreed to stand down from the positions the rebels had taken in the capital Ouagadougou, while the army also agreed to withdraw its troops and guarantee the safety of the rebel presidential guard members and their families, according to reports by Mail & Guardian Africa.\n\nThe attempted military coup comes just weeks before national elections were to take place on Oct. 11. The elections were seen as a means to stabilize the country, since they will be the first to take place since former President Blaise Compaore was toppled last October.\n\nRELATED: Reflecting on the Burkina Faso Uprising"

Algeria\u2019s order for the vessel emerged in late 2014 when it was confirmed that it had signed a contract for a single vessel, plus an option for a second. Intermarine was originally reported to be in negotiations with Algeria regarding the vessel in 2013 and at Euronaval 2014 Intermarine announced it had started working on a mine countermeasures vessel for an unspecified customer, which turned out to be Algeria.\n\nOrizzonte Sistemi Navali acted as prime contractor, while Intermarine carried out most of the work as a subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to IHS Jane\u2019s, the vessels is based on the Katanpaa class vessels built for the Finnish Navy.

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nNew Delhi: Indian Army soldiers along the Line of Control (LoC) finally have access to deadly new sniper rifles after their arrival at the Northern Command, which looks after the crucial LoC and some part of the Line of Actual Control with China.\n\nThe new rifles include an anti-material rifle that can go through concrete and metal objects.\n\nThe sniper rifles being given to the soldiers, as a replacement for the ageing Russian Dragunov, are the .50 Calibre M95 by Barrett and the .338 Lapua Magnum Scorpio TGT by Beretta.\n\nSources said the soldiers will be trained on these rifles before the equipment is deployed for use at the LoC where sniping incidents have increased.\n\nA limited number of rifles were bought through the emergency purchase power of the Northern Commander.\n\nWith the arrival of the new sniper rifles, ThePrint takes a look at the role they will play in the Northern Command.\n\nWhy the new rifles\n\nSources say formations at the LoC felt the need to go in for superior sniper rifles as the dynamic in the region has changed.\n\nThe Pakistan Army has resorted to sniping in a big way to hit at soldiers guarding the LoC. Many times, soldiers have been hit even in their own posts, besides being targeted when they are out patrolling.\n\nEven though the Indian Army has retaliated in equal terms, the need was felt for more modern and deadlier sniper rifles.\n\nAlso read: The new danger in Kashmir: Cold, calculating snipers who are wary of close contact\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the new rifles?\n\nThe US-made Barrett M95 is an anti-material rifle which has a range of 1,800 metres. The gun, which is in use with many special forces around the world, is a bolt action sniper rifle chambered in a .50 Browing Machine Gun cartridge (12.7\u00d799mm).\n\nWith an unloaded gun weighing about 10 kg, the M95 first came out way back in 1995, and is part of the Barrett M82 family, the first notable American-made .50 Caliber anti-material rifle introduced in 1982.\n\nThe gun feeds from a five-round detachable box magazine and is a more compact and lighter version than earlier products.\n\nThe other gun that will be available to the troops along the LoC is the Victrix Armaments\u2019 .338 Lapua Magnum Scorpio TGT, owned by Italian firm Beretta.\n\nThe Scorpio TGT uses the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6\u00d770mm or 8.58\u00d770mm), a rimless, bottlenecked, centre-fire rifle cartridge.\n\nIt was developed in the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. It was used in the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War.\n\nAlthough the .338 Lapua Magnum was initially developed to penetrate body armour at 1,000 metres, it has been used effectively to 1,500 metres and beyond, and holds the distinction of being part of some of the record-breaking sniper shots in war.\n\nAt least 30 countries use the .338 Lapua Magnum sniper rifles and over a dozen manufacturers produce rifles, in multiple configurations, in this calibre.\n\nAlso read: Militant snipers add grisly new chapter to Kashmir insurgency with three kills\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "Mali\u2019s air force has taken delivery of four Embraer Super Tucano light attack and trainer aircraft after placing the order three years ago.\n\nThe four aircraft (PT-ZTN, PT-ZTI, PT-ZTJ and PT-ZTF) were seen in Recife on 7 July during their delivery flight from Brazil. They stopped there overnight before heading on to Mali, where they arrived on 10 July. They were officially received by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita the following day at Air Base 101, together with other dignitaries that included Prime Minister Soumeylou Boub\u00e8ye Ma\u00efga, and Chief of the Air Force General Souleymane Bamba.\n\nKeita said the arrival of the new aircraft was part of the rejuvenation of the country\u2019s military and that the need for aircraft was great in such a large nation.\n\nMali signed a contract with Embraer for the six aircraft at the Paris Air Show on 15 June 2015. Embraer said the contract includes logistic support for the operation of these aircraft and also provides a training system for pilots and mechanics of the Mali Air Force. Ten pilots and 17 technicians have been trained on the new Super Tucanos.\n\nIt is understood that the four aircraft delivered are configured for light attack and close air support. It had been suggested the remaining two would be fitted with surveillance systems and used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, including border patrol, but sources indicate the last two were cancelled in order to save money. It has been alleged that Mali\u2019s Super Tucanos were delivered without sighting systems due to American reluctance to supply sighting equipment.\n\nThe first two aircraft for Mali were first seen undergoing test flights in November and December 2016 at Bacacheri Airport in south-eastern Brazil.\n\nBamba said that during the first half of 2018, Mali\u2019s Air Force flew 1 068 missions, accumulating 1 696 flight hours. This included 75 medical evacuations and the transport of 25 prisoners. Reconnaissance aircraft carried out 410 missions, transport aircraft transported over 9 000 people and 78 tons of cargo and combat aircraft flew 359 missions during which they fired 155 rockets and 582 23 mm rounds.\n\nThe Super Tucano delivery is the latest in a series of acquisitions for Mali\u2019s Air Force, which has received nearly a dozen new aircraft over the last couple of years. In October 2017 Keita welcomed the delivery of new aircraft to the country\u2019s Air Force, including a C-295W transport, two Y-12 light utility aircraft, two Mi-35M combat helicopters and a Super Puma transport helicopter.\n\nThe two Y-12E light transport aircraft were delivered from China in early September 2017 and joined a number of Basler BT-67 turboprops in Malian service. The delivery of the two Mi-35Ms was confirmed by Rosoboronexport on 3 October. The Mi-35M sale was announced last year. According to the EU Training Mission in Mali\u2019s September newsletter, Mali has another two Mi-35Ms on order and these will be delivered by 2019.\n\nMali is expanding its Air Force and taken delivery of new transport, attack and training aircraft. In October 2016 the country received its first of two H215 Super Puma helicopters from Airbus Helicopters (purchased for $18 million) and that December a single C295W transport from Airbus Defence and Space. The C295W is being used to provide logistics support, medical evacuation, and troop transport capabilities to the Malian military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by the EU Training Mission, in January 2016 Keita announced the implementation of a military investment plan to the value of 1,230 billion CFA. This plan formed part of the \u201cMilitary Orientation and Planning Law (Loi d\u2019orientation et de programmation militaire, LOPM)\u201d, approved in February 2015. This covers the modernisation of the Malian Armed Forces and the recruitment of 10 000 volunteers. The Malian Armed Forces should number 20 000 by 2019. The plan also includes the reorganisation of the Air Force and the purchase of new aircraft."

The Wing Loong drone is said to compete in features with the Predator medium altitude long range (MALE) drone made by the US firm, General Atomics.\n\nLast month, the Egyptian Ministry of Defence had shown a video of the Wing Loong drone, taking off with missiles on its hard-points and knocking off a ground target. The publicity video was telecast on Egyptian media on the occasion of the 45th Air Force Day.\n\nThe publication of the video indicates that Egypt may already be in possession of the drones and may have signed up to buy more or them. Besides the Wing Loong, CATIC also manufactures the Harrier, a reconnaissance drone capable of long endurance.\n\nChinese firms generally do not announce sales of military wares to foreign countries. Information published in international media is shared in state-owned Chinese publications with local defence experts commenting on the possible sale."

The upgrade will be done locally by the state-run Ordnance Factories Board at the cost of about $50 million.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade work will involve replacing the existing muzzle brake, breech block and associated modifications to the recoil system, apart from replacing the 130mm barrel with a 155mm barrel.\n\n\n\nThe Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) has received the final confirmation of the contract for the upgrade of 300 artillery guns after the successful user trial of a prototype.\n\n\n\n\"We have successfully enhanced the capability of the artillery gun. Its ammunition is already manufactured by ordnance factories. Recently, the Indian Army has ordered to upgrade 300 such guns,\" S. K. Chourasia, OFB Chairman, told Sputnik.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army had initiated the upgrade of the Soviet era guns in 2008 with the contract being awarded to the Israeli firm Soltam \u2014 now part of Elbit. Soltam's contract was suspended midway after allegations that it had bribed officials. Later, the government had decided to throw open the contract for domestic companies. The state-run Ordnance Factories Board participated in the tender issued by the Indian Army, competing with two other private manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\"After extensive field evaluation trial, OFB's gun has emerged as the only gun system meeting all quality requirements,\" an OFB official said.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army plans to eventually convert all existing field guns into 155mm/52-caliber guns \u2014 wheeled, tracked, self-propelled and mounted \u2014 which will cost approximately $6 billion.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

He said, \u201cWe are excited to deliver this C-130 at a time of such great optimism.

Earlier reports suggested it may be a second C-130 but this now seems unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Air Force\u2019s 15 Squadron has flown C-130s since 1998 when it received two former US Air Force C-130Bs and later two commercial L100-30 variants that were previously operated by the Ethiopian Government. It is not clear if the aircraft are still operational.\n\n* This article was upated to reflect the fact that the handover is likely for the C-130E that was donated in 2014."

The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him that were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and his three children.\"The thug that tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in total fear,\" Trump continued. \"Baghdadi's demise demonstrates... our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long.\"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump for the killing of Baghdadi, calling it an \u201cimpressive achievement.\u201dNetanyahu, who released a statement within moments of Trump ending his press conference where he announced Baghdadi's killing, said that it \u201creflects our shared determination \u2013 of the United States and all free states \u2013 to fight terrorist organizations and terrorist states.\u201dNetanyahu said that while this was an \u201cimportant milestone,\u201d the campaign against terrorism is \u201cstill in front of us.\u201dTrump additionally clarified that no US personnel were killed in the operation, though one dog was injured entering the tunnel.

Baghdadi and the losers who work for him, and losers they are, had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases, they were very frightened puppies; in other cases, hardcore killers. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way; as a coward, running and crying.\"\"Russia was great,\" he said, explaining that the personnel as part of the operation had to fly over Russian territory.\"I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us,\" he added.Yisrael Beytenu leader and former defense minister Avigdor Liberman wrote on his Twitter account, saying, \"The US military's cautionary operation based on high-quality intelligence is evidence that the US government and the US security forces are the leading forces in fighting Islamic terrorism.\"Al-Baghdadi was a symbol of the extremist Islam, which suffered a heavy moral and operational blow,\" he continued, explaining that his death proves that terrorists are not safe wherever they are, \"including Gaza and Lebanon.\"Foreign Minister Israel Katz also congratulated Trump on Twitter for the operation, adding that the achievement \"is extremely important in the war against one of the most murderous terrorist organizations of our time\" and that the assassination is \"an important message to the free world that in a determined war, terror can be won.\"\"There is a great urgency to create a no-fly-zone in northern Syria,\" said former justice minister MK Ayelet Shaked in response to the assassination. \"It is imperative this is done to prevent the ethnic cleansing of two million Kurds, and to put radical Islamists in their place.\"She further clarified that such an act is necessary in order to \"prevent ISIS from raising its head and avenging the death of their leader.\"\"The world is a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gone,\" said former education and interior minister Gideon Saar on Twitter after Trump's press conference. \"The United States has made sure he met the end that terrorists should meet.

After the 12-month period, TCG Bayraktar will become responsibility of the Turkish Navy.\n\nTCG Bayraktar and sister ship TCG Sancaktar, the second ship in the class, are being built under a contract signed between Anadolu Shipyard and the Turkish Ministry of Defense in May 2011. TCG Sancaktar was launched on July 16, 2016 and is expected to be delivered in October this year.\n\nFirst steel for TCG Bayraktar was cut in May 2014 and the ship was launched on October 3, 2015.\n\nTCG Bayraktar and her sister ship displace over 7200 tonnes at 139 meters. They are capable of transporting up to 1.200 tonnes of cargo (18 tanks).\n\nAdditionally, the ships are equipped with two command and control centers (one for ship\u2019s CIC and the other for joint amphibious command and control purposes) and four landing craft, vehicle, personnel boats (each can carry 40 Marines or 8 t cargo).\n\nThey feature three onload/offload gates (fore, aft, and port side) and have an 18 m trifold bow ramp. A fore draft of less than 2 meters makes the ships suitable for beach landing operations."

Yet, the report said, the military has remained a \u201clargely opaque and unaccountable institution\u201d.\n\nThe average defence budget is estimated to be about $4.4bn, but little is known about where that gets earmarked as it is treated as a state secret.\n\nDuring the past five years, Egypt has become the third largest arms importer in the world, but Lynch said there is little to show in terms of protecting the safety and security of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian people have a military that does everything but keep the country secure,\u201d he said. \u201cIts concern with building its economic and political power has hugely frustrated its efforts to deal with the security challenges it faces in the Sinai and other places.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, several human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have accused members of the Egyptian military of extrajudicial executions in the Sinai, showing \u201cthey fear no oversight or accountability for their actions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a military that may very well be the architect of its own security crisis,\u201d Lynch said.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nTransparency in the face of opacity\n\nAs human rights abuses and state violence in Egypt continue to increase, the report made a series of recommendations for the international community to counter the opacity of the Egyptian military.\n\nIt called for making financial and security assistance dependant on achieving basic levels of transparency and accountability, and to amplify domestic voices advocating for that.\n\nIt also urged better domestic oversight of the armed forces by asking tougher questions on the military\u2019s economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe international community must understand that not only is it doing a major disservice to the people of Egypt by providing support to the armed forces with few strings attached,\u201d Lynch said, \u201cit is also contributing to the security crisis in the country and region.\u201d"

A team of NAF officers will visit Brazil to inspect the aircraft ahead of delivery.\n\nNigeria also intends to purchase new Super Tucano aircraft from the United State. Indications are that up to 12 of the light attack and trainer turboprops could be acquired from the United States, via Embraer\u2019s Florida production line that is run in conjunction with Sierra Nevada Corp.\n\nThe US Congress has not yet been formally notified of a possible US approval of the sale of Super Tucanos to Nigeria, but in May last year Reuters reported that the US was seeking to approve the sale.\n\nNigeria has a strong requirement for an aircraft like the Super Tucano as it battles the domestic Boko Haram insurgency and also deploys combat aircraft to foreign countries on peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Tucano can be used for training, surveillance or attack. It can be armed with two wing-mounted machine guns and can carry up to 1 550 kg of weapons."

Based on the location and the coordinates of his plane's path, some say he steered the ill fated plane from hitting villages. Which is why the plane was found in a paddy field. So he couldn't deploy his parachute in time and they had to drag his body from the water. I hope they give him a proper funeral. Thanks for your contribution here and helping us stay updated bro"
