    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The incoming Brazilian government is poised to follow through on a plan to funnel oil and gas revenue toward new defense spending, leaving European shipbuilders hopeful that the country can afford its new corvette program.\n\nDirecting 2 percent of royalties from offshore drilling to the military has been a national policy for some time, but previous governments have never fully applied it, according to Eric Berthelot, who heads the Brazilian subsidiary of French shipbuilder Naval Group. Officials under outgoing president Michel Temer first moved to tap the oil fund and have so far forwarded roughly $650 million to state-owned Emgepron to manage new naval projects like the $1.5 billion Tamandar\u00e9 frigate program.\n\nThe government of President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who will take office in January, is expected to further implement the policy, according to several industry officials in Europe. They said Brazil\u2019s ability to pay for the program will be closely watched as the Bolsonaro government makes its first moves next year.\n\nFrance\u2019s Naval Group eyes Brazil as hub for its regional submarine business Brazil's launch of the Riachuelo attack submarine is only a first step toward greater spending on warships, including nuclear-powered boats.\n\nNaval Group is competing against Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Dutch shipbuilder Damen and Italy\u2019s Fincantieri. The Brazilian Navy and the four bidders are in the final stages of coordination before the proposals are due on March 8. The Navy is expected to pick a winner later that month, though it is possible officials will await the LAAD defense expo here in early April to announce results.\n\nThe Tamandar\u00e9 program is for four ships and an initial eight-year maintenance package. The warships are meant to help protect Brazil's resource-rich waters up and down its vast coastline, dubbed the Blue Amazon.\n\nEuropean vendors tussling for business in the same competitions worldwide has become a recurring theme, fueling calls for consolidation of the continent\u2019s shipbuilding industry to retain a competitive edge.\n\n\u201cThe Europeans are more divided than ever,\u201d Naval Group Herv\u00e9 Guillou told reporters at one of the company\u2019s offices here.

    "text": "A picture reportedly of Russia's Okhotnik, or Hunter, unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), appears to have emerged on social media. Officially dubbed URBK, or Udarno-Razvedyvatelnyi Bespilotnyi Kompleks in Russian, which translates to Strike-Reconnaissance Unmanned Complex, the aircraft has been in development for years in one form or another, with Russian aircraft design house Sukhoi leading-up the project. The photo that appeared on Russia's top social media site VK shows a flying wing UCAV on a frigid taxiway and looks to have been taken at a distance and between barren trees surrounding the airfield.\n\nVK.ru\n\nThere is also a second picture from a slightly different perspective focused on one of the aircraft's main landing gear.\n\nVK\n\nThe photos are reminiscent of the ones that came out of China showing it's J-20 stealth fighter for the first time in 2011. It is quite possible that the image was a deliberately \"leaked\" as the Ministry of Defense has touted the upcoming flight testing for the UCAV since the Summer of 2018. The craft itself looks fairly impressive and substantial in size with a hardy landing gear that looks similar to those used on modern Russian tactical jet designs. The configuration appears to be loosely similar to something between Northrop Grumman's X-47B and Boeing's X-45C Phantom Ray, as well as other international UCAV designs. The blisters protruding from its fuselage are likely necessary systems for testing and not representative of a final production configuration. \"Next year, the Okhotnik will enter trials. The work on this project is a priority and it is proceeding at a good level. In the spring, we are expecting the first flight of this drone,\" Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Alexei Krivoruchko told the Ministry of Defense's official television channel TV Zvezda in December 2018. \"This is a serious task for us.\"\n\nIn November 2018, An unnamed Russian ministry source had also told state-run news outlet TASS that the Okhotnik prototype had completed its first ground tests, including taxying and a takeoff run, at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association's plant, which support's Sukhoi's research and development programs and actual aircraft production. Though it reportedly reached a speed of more than 120 miles per hour, the UCAV did not actually take off. The anonymous individual also said that the unmanned aircraft had accelerated down the runway and then slowed to a stop in a \"fully automated mode.\" The general weather conditions in the picture would match with the reports from Novosibirsk in November 2018, suggesting that this picture could be from those ground tests. The current weather there is also frigid and snowy, though, so it could easily have some time between now and then or even before, too. A previous picture purportedly of the Okhotnik had emerged in 2017 as part of an official Russian Ministry of Defense briefing slide. The much lower quality image did show a flying wing design roughly similar to the unmanned aircraft in the new pictures. The caption to the 2017 image had described the aircraft as \"Okhotnik-B,\" suggesting there may be or have been multiple subvariants or configurations over the course of its development. It's most likely the earlier photo is of a subscale demonstrator.\n\nIn addition, in recent days, one of Russia's handful of Su-57s has emerged wearing unique markings showing the shape of a UCAV flying alongside the shape of Su-57 with a lightning bolt between the two. The bolt is universally used to show electronic connectivity and data sharing. A number of aerials are also new to the Su-57 in question, which would be used for data-linking between it and the Okhotnik. The manned aircraft could potentially forward that information to testers on the ground. Making the mission of this particular Su-57 even clearer, a shot of the aircraft from the bottom shows its digital paint scheme resembles the shape of a stealthy UCAV. The jet could be acting as a surrogate testbed for certain technologies that will go into the Okhotnik, as well.\n\nRussia's move to developing a UCAV that is capable of manned-unmanned teaming involving UCAVs acting as \"loyal wingmen\" to Su-57s and eventually other aircraft makes a lot of sense. The U.S. Air Force, in particular, has been actively exploring the concept which you can read about in more detail here. But for Russia, Okhotnik could help overcome known deficiencies in the Su-57 design, which you can read about in detail here, and create a team that is truly more than the sum of its parts. This is in addition to using the UCAV as an independent asset or networked with other UCAVs for strike, surveillance, and electronic warfare missions. Separately, the MiG company has also been working on their own stealthy UCAV, known as Skat, or Manta Ray, the present status of which is unclear. There are also unconfirmed reports that this project may have helped inform the development of Okhotnik. Sukhoi and MiG are both under the umbrella of Russia's state-owned United Aircraft Corporation. Whether or not this new image is of Okhotnik, or some other design, if it is indeed real it is the latest evidence that Russia remains committed to the development of a stealth UCAV. China continues to charge in the same direction, as does India, and countries in Europe are following suit, as well. Meanwhile, the United States continues to act as if this game-changing technology doesn't even exist, at least publically, even though they proved it was incredibly promising a decade and a half ago. You can read all about this history and the odd paradox it that exist because of it in this past special feature of ours. If Sukhoi intends to keep to its previously reported schedule and have Okhotnik make its first flight later this spring, we might not have to wait too much longer to see how far the Russians have moved toward making their stealthy unmanned combat air vehicle dreams a reality.

An official said the termination of the deal meant this money has now gone \u2018down the drain.\u2019Sources said that at a top-level meeting on the project earlier this year, conducted by the PMO, the Air Force expressed reservations on the Russian proposal meeting all its requirements.While these were being addressed, with suggestions by top officials that improvements could be made, DRDO was asked for its opinion on whether the deal would result in the infusion of high-end technologies in India. An emphatic response by then DRDO chief, S Christopher , sealed the fate of the programme.India has now told Russia that it would not be participating in the development part of the programme, but would consider purchasing the fighter jets in the future as and when the technology matures and is proven.The deal being negotiated was to make a tailored jet for India with four flying prototypes to be delivered by 2019-20. It also included production facilities for at least 127 aircraft in India.Russia has also offered to sell India 20 of its older MiG-29 fighter jets to boost the declining fighter strength for a little over Rs 2000 crore. A decision on taking this proposal forward is however yet to be taken."

    "text": "Authors: Ron Matthews, Defence Academy of the UK, and Xiaojuan Ping, NUS\n\nIs China\u2019s arms export strategy really a success story? The first question is to establish whether there has been dramatic growth in China\u2019s arms exports, emulating the success of its broader commercial exports. While the picture is not equivocal, there are signs that something is indeed happening.\n\nChinese arms sales are growing. Across 2012\u201316, they accounted for 6.2 per cent of the global arms trade, up by an impressive 74 per cent compared to 2007\u201311. In fact, over 2012\u201316, China\u2019s arms exports raced ahead of those from Germany, France and the United Kingdom, making China the world\u2019s third biggest arms exporter.\n\nThis is not a short-term aberration, but a long-term trend. Between 2000 and 2015, Chinese arms exports expanded by a factor of 6.5. In 2016, China shipped US$2.1 billion in arms, marginally behind France\u2019s US$2.2 billion, but well ahead of the United Kingdom\u2019s US$1.4 billion. While China\u2019s 2016 market share is well below that of the United States at 33 per cent, the gap is gradually closing with Russia (23 per cent), and has disappeared altogether with France (6 per cent), Germany (5.6 per cent) and the United Kingdom (4.6 per cent).\n\nChina\u2019s arms exports have been criticised for lacking global appeal since 72 per cent of all exports in the last five years went to just three countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Yet, this criticism is unfair. Such dependence on a few core customers affects both mature and \u2018new entrant\u2019 arms exporters alike.\n\nRussia was the world\u2019s second biggest arms exporter across 2012\u201316 but relied on just four countries \u2014 India, Vietnam, China and Algeria \u2014 for 70 per cent of those sales. Likewise, 71 per cent of UK arms exports go to India, the United States and Saudi Arabia (which alone accounted for half of all UK sales across 2010\u201315).\n\nDetractors argue that China\u2019s weapons are only attractive to poorer nations because its older weapons are cheaper. While there is some truth in this argument, it needs qualification. China has been successful in diversifying its customer base and now exports arms to 55 countries worldwide, covering Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Many of China\u2019s clients are indeed developing countries. For example, two-thirds of the countries situated in the world\u2019s poorest continent, Africa, procure weapon systems from China, and much of it is basic military equipment.\n\nBut times are changing. Chinese arms are no longer relics from a bygone Soviet era. The PLA has been replacing old Soviet platforms with improved \u2018indigenous\u2019 models and is now exporting modernised platforms, including Type-99 MBTs, J-10 fighters and Yuan-class submarines to Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nChina has also adapted, innovated and engaged in systems integration in a determined bid to move up the technology ladder, developing, for instance, credible and competitive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and anti-ship cruise missiles. Raised technological sophistication combined with relatively low procurement cost has led to increasingly cost-effective arms exports. Their attractiveness to more discerning buyers has been translated into a sales portfolio in which 25 per cent of China\u2019s customers are now positioned in the upper middle/higher income country categories, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIs there something different, something special, that distinguishes China\u2019s arms export strategy from its Western counterparts? The answer is a resounding yes. First and foremost, Western strategists should not be under any illusion that export revenue is the primary goal. Rather, Beijing\u2019s end-game is longer-term geo-political and strategic influence. The search for regional and global influence is the critical aim of Chinese economic diplomacy. It reflects a more narrowly focused aspect of Beijing\u2019s soft power framework, embracing foreign aid, foreign direct investment, overseas educational programs and, importantly, arms sales.\n\nChina\u2019s arms export model operates according to a carefully-crafted strategy based on three principles: promoting the legitimate self-defence capability of the recipient country; strengthening the peace, security and stability of that country and region; and non-interference in its internal affairs.\n\nBeijing\u2019s long-standing approach of linking non-interference to arms sales rests on the view that a customer\u2019s political, military and human rights record lies outside the contractual arrangements. The \u2018no questions asked\u2019 policy attracts the opprobrium of Western states, but there is no disputing its effectiveness in selling guns and securing influence. The policy particularly appeals to second- and third-tier military states suffering excessive dependence on US or Russian weaponry. Chinese arms offer poorer states the opportunity to diversify arms sources, regain a degree of sovereignty over military capability and reduce strategic vulnerability to arms embargoes.\n\nThe Chinese arms export model has several other significant features. From a Chinese strategic perspective, it leverages strong client-state relationships and in the process bolsters Beijing\u2019s influence, particularly among neighbouring states. It is no accident that China\u2019s arms sales to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar indirectly act to contain the potential threat of Asia\u2019s other mega-power, India. Chinese arms are also competitively packaged. Pricing is low compared to Western models. Chinese drones, for example, reportedly cost 10\u201320 per cent of the near-equivalent US version. Finally, China is amenable to technology transfer through defence offset, supporting client states to indigenise maintenance, repair and overhaul activities and even produce components.\n\nWhile it may not yet be the dominant player, China\u2019s arms export strategy has proved effective in taking market share from competitor nations. China has also begun to encroach into higher income markets, especially where technological sophistication is not required. There is a long-term strategy at work here, driven by diplomatic and geostrategic objectives, not commercial gain.\n\nRon Matthews is Chair of Defence Economics at the Centre for Defence Management and Leadership, Cranfield University and the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom.\n\nXiaojuan Ping is a researcher at the East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore."

    "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."

    "text": "Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody has sold L-39NG jets to Senegal, which are configured for light attack and training.\n\nAero Vodochody on 4 April said the President of Senegal, Macky Sall, during national Independence Day celebrations, announced the purchase of the four L-39NGs.\n\nThe contract will also cover the training of pilots, including conversion, instructor and combat training, maintenance personnel training, spare parts, ground support equipment and logistic support services.\n\nSenegal\u2019s air force has few fixed wing combat aircraft, its most significant purchase being Super Tucanos in 2013. It has several Mi-35P Hind attack helicopters in service.\n\n\u201cThe L-39NG aircraft is the new future of Aero Vodochody, the company that has been producing proprietary aircraft since 1919. The L-39NG is based on successful aero dynamical concept of the current L-39, but is manufactured with the use of new technologies and contains modern systems,\u201d said Giuseppe Giordo, the president of Aero Vodochody. \u201cCurrently we also have two additional contracts in a very mature state of negotiation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn January, Aero started up the L-39NG pre-series production line. Aero is currently producing a total of four L-39NGs. The first and the fourth aircraft will be used for flight tests, the second one for static tests and the third for fatigue tests. The first flight of the new pre-series L-39NG is planned to happen at the end of 2018 with deliveries expected to start in early 2020. Full scale production is expected by 2022 with 16 units a year.\n\nThe L-39NG programme started in 2014. The aircraft is powered by a single Williams FJ44-4M engine with FADEC control and has five hardpoints for 1 200 kg of weapons (three more than previously). Other changes compared to the standard L-39 are wet wings without wingtip tanks, it has a 15 000 flight hour service life, lighter and stronger airframe and Health and Usage Monitoring System. The L-39NG uses 50% new parts and 50% parts taken from the existing L-39.\n\nAero Vodochody said that, after focussing on aerostructures, the Senegalese L-39NG sale represents the first international sale of new aircraft in 20 years.\n\nThe sale of the light attack version of the aircraft is the first of a series the company is seeking to close abroad after bringing in industry veteran Giuseppe Giordo as president in 2016 to help turn the company around.\n\nDuring the last days of the Cold War in 1988, Aero Vodochody\u2019s factory outside Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia produced a 250 of its Albatros L-39 training jets for Soviet bloc air forces.\n\nThose customers disappeared with the collapse of Communism as successive governments focused on building a market economy and steered away from arms exports, sending the industry into a tailspin. Numerous comeback attempts sputtered for Aero, which halted jet production between 2003 and 2015.\n\nBoeing bought a stake in Aero in the 1990s but sold it back to the government after failing to land new contracts. Czech-Slovak private equity group Penta bought Aero in 2006.\n\nGiordo has overseen the relaunch of the L-159 and has championed the next generation L-39 trainer. It aims to produce up to 26 aircraft annually over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nIn recent years, Aero sold its L-159 light combat aircraft to the Iraq Air Force and US aviation services company Draken International. Those aircraft were originally made for the Czech military in the early 2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-series production L-39NGs will be delivered to the launch customer, Czech state-owned company LOM Praha. Besides LOM Praha, the L-39NG is also being acquired by the Breitling Jet Team and Draken International\u2019s Black Diamond Jet Team."

Several more rotorcraft bodies of the new helicopters are at their final assembly point at Arsenyev. In February, another batch of Ka-52 helicopters will be transferred to their operators,\u201d Russian helicopters said.\n\nThe first batch of Alligators scheduled for delivery in 2017 per government contract terms was transferred to the Russian Ministry of Defense ahead of schedule in December last year. In 2017, production of these helicopters will be more than doubled as some will be headed overseas, Russian Helicopters said. \u201cThe first experimental unit for a foreign customer has already been assembled and is successfully passing all tests as planned.\u201d While not specifically mentioning Egypt, the Ka-52 has no other known foreign orders except for the North African country.\n\n\u201cWe took all necessary organizational and technological steps at Progress to expand production in view of the forthcoming volume increase. Today, the plant is ready to produce world-class Ka-52 helicopters in a timely manner, for the Ministry of Defense, as well as for foreign customers,\u201d said Russian Helicopters Deputy CEO for Sales Vladislav Savelyev.\n\nRussia confirmed the sale of 46 Ka-52Ks to Egypt in December 2015. Russian Helicopters Director-General Alexander Mikheyev said deliveries to Egypt are expected to occur in 2017.\n\nThe Ka-52 Alligator is a development of the Ka-50 Black Shark, featuring two crew side-by-side in a new nose housing additional avionics. The Ka-52 is in service with the Russian Air Force, which has ordered 146 Ka-52s while Russian naval aviation will receive 32 navalised Ka-52Ks. Production began in 2008.\n\nThe helicopter is fitted with four underwing hardpoints capable of carrying 80/120 mm air-to-surface rockets, 9A4172 Vikhr-M (AT-12) laser-guided air-to-surface missiles, Igla or R-73 (AA-11 \u2018Archer\u2019) air-to-air missiles, Kh-25MP (AS-12 \u2018Kegler\u2019) anti-radiation missiles and FAB-500 bombs. Fixed armament comprises a 30 mm 2A42 gun with up to 240 rounds of ammunition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgypt will fly its Ka-52s off its Mistral class landing helicopter dock vessels \u2013 these were handed over to Egypt in June and September 2016. As they were originally destined for Russia, they were designed to accommodate the Ka-52K helicopter. Each vessel can operate 16 helicopters."

    "text": "DEBUNKING THE ISPR\u2019s ANTITHESIS OF A PRECISION STRIKE AT BALAKOT\n\nHOW THE PAK ARMY\u2019s DG ISPR TRIED TO MISLEAD EVERYONE INTO BELIEVING THAT THE IAF STRIKES HIT \u2018NOTHING\u2019\u2014 THIS OSINT ANALYSIS UNMASKS THE DUBIOUSNESS AND CHARADE OF THE FIRST VISIT BY INDEPENDENT MEDIA TO THE JeM CAMP AT BALAKOT SINCE THE DAY THE INDIAN AIR FORCE STRUCK THE TERROR CAMP WITH SPICE 2000 PRECISION BOMBS ON 26 FEBRUARY 2019 Sameer Joshi Apr 11, 2019\u00b715 min read\n\n43 days after the Indian Air Force\u2019s strike at Balakot, the Pak establishment has finally opened the gates of the Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp at Balakot to international media \u2014 innocuously masking the huge internal damage caused to the various buildings targeted with a quick rebuild job, and the trademark subterfuge of the spin doctors at the ISPR \u2014 led from the front by the wily Major General Asif Ghafoor himself, who unfortunately now carries the ignominy of having been caught lying on umpteen occasions in the last few days. Living up to his reputation, Major General Ghafoor took the visitors everywhere \u2014 except the targets that India hit; masking his visit well with the famed ISPR doctrine of \u2018delay, confuse and deny\u2019.\n\nAbout a Black Hole\n\nHumanity got its first glimpse this Wednesday, the 10th of April of the cosmic place of no return \u2014 A black hole, located far away in the Messier 87 galaxy, which is 55 million light-years away in the Virgo galaxy cluster. And it\u2019s as hot, as violent and as beautiful as science fiction imagined it to be.\n\nMuch closer to us at Jabba top, Balakot in Pakistan; Major General Asif Ghafoor, the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and chief spokesperson of Pakistan Armed Forces, gave the world a glimpse of another black hole \u2014 which 43 days after the Indian Air Forces\u2019s Mirage 2000 strike \u2014 has awe-aspiringly swallowed all signs of the internal mayhem and destruction caused by the 1000 kg Spice 2000 bunker busting munition. Since then, a hardcore terror training camp has miraculously transformed itself into a Pak Army supported surreal visage of peace and harmony, where young children and students gain the Taleem ul Quran.\n\nReputedly the properties of a black hole are mass, charge, and rotation and all other information inside the event horizon is lost. Maj Gen Ghafoor had utilised similar attributes to unleash the ISPR\u2019s agenda much before this visit to the JeM camp by media and international observers \u2014 mass: his 20\u201330,000 fake ISPR handles on social media created a huge repository of fake news, narration and related content within a short time after the IAF strikes on 26 February; charge: the content propagated a blitzkrieg of the false narration, which effectively vitiated ability of neutral observers to absorb the actual Indian perspective, effectively charging up the atmosphere with a rhetoric of falsehood, deception and a spiteful debate; rotation: having achieved a measure of disinformation, the ISPR gave a spin to the event by getting specialist geospatial opinion on the subject \u2014 which was clearly aimed to demonstrate to the world that the IAF strikes hit \u2018nothing\u2019 \u2014 the event horizon being the visit by independent media and observers to the JeM camp \u2014 aimed at fortifying Pakistan\u2019s firm stance and demolishing the Indian Air Force\u2019s claim of a successful precision strike on 26 February 2019.\n\nFar from being the Pak antithesis of a successful IAF raid, the visit reveals a massive coverup by the Pak Army to the trained eye, the video evidence of which has been provided by none other than the head of ISPR himself through his official twitter handle. A thousand lies by the ISPR will still not be able cover the truth \u2014 especially since there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\n\nDG ISPR\u2019s tweet on the visit of a closed group of invitees to to the JeM camp\n\nRevisiting the strike at Jabba Top, Balakot\n\nThe IAF Mirage-2000s hit the JeM camp at Jabba top at 0330H on 26 February 2019 with the Spice 2000 bunker busting bombs. These deep penetration bombs struck their Designated Mean Points of Impact (DMPI) as planned and destroyed the innards of their targeted building with low yield explosives, causing significant internal damage and killing all with an over pressure shock wave. The detailed analysis of this strike can be read here.\n\nThe IAF has confirmed that it has immediate post strike synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, showing clear hits on the DMPIs \u2014 thus its an open and shut case for India.\n\nOSINT data shows 3 x Spice 2000 bomb entry points on the roof of the Mujahid Hostel\n\nHow the penetrator version of the Spice 2000 cleanly enters the targeted building\n\nSince the penetrator version of the bomb doesn\u2019t usually collapse the building (refer the above image), the Pak Army was able to replace the roofs showing the entry holes of the strike munition in the days to come. The international experts missed this out because they did not have high resolution imagery, enough to detect the three holes of the bombs. The incorrect analysis and info from which was thus used by the independent experts to validate their claims, some claiming it was a near miss for India. These have been addressed with appropriate counter views.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan Army reacted well in covering up the evidence of entry of bombs on the target within the first six hours after the event. This aspect was crucial towards giving the required \u2018misdirection\u2019 to the story by the ISPR in the days to come.\n\nVisit by media and military observers on 10 April 2019\n\nForty-three days after the Indian Air Force struck Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camps in Pakistan\u2019s Balakot, the Pakistani government took representatives of some Islamabad-based international media houses and foreign diplomats to the area.\n\nLets analyse the account of a reporter working with BBC Hindi, who was part of the entourage. His part of the story is tracked in italics from an english interpretation of the article here.\n\nThe BBC Hindi correspondent mentioned after boarding a helicopter at Islamabad, said they landed at a place near Mansehra. They passed through some difficult mountainous terrain for the next one-and-a-half hours.*\n\nThe convoy of media and military heads towarsd the Jabba top,\n\nNear the camp, the entourage had to trek for 90 odd minutes to reach the top\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the camp, the Pak Army directed them not to \u201cspeak too long\u201d to local residents.* Obvious question, if nothing happened there \u2014 why was the Pak Army putting restrictions on the independent observers to interact with the locals.\n\nThe visit started with a clear cut agenda \u2014 The information blackout was to persist under the farce of a so called independent verification. The ISPR has no plans of letting things go out of control. It has already burnt its fingers in the past when in the first week of March after the strikes, Francesca Marino, an Italian journalist confirmed through her sources that the death toll in the IAF strike was between 40 and 50, which included ISI personnel. She also stated that 35 to 40 people had been injured in the strike. This has been reinforced by the statement of Maulana Ammar, the younger brother of the JEM boss Masood Azhar, that the madrassa complex at Jabba top has indeed been hit by Indian bombs.\n\nThe screen grab from an Indian TV channel shows clearly that JeM was at the helm of affairs at Balakot\n\nIndian intelligence had estimated more than 250 -300 individuals active inside the camp before the strike. Details of actual number of casualties is not clear as of now.\n\nOk, back to the BBC reporters account of the visit to Jabba top\u2014 *When the authorities were asked about the delay in arranging the tour, they cited \u201cthe unstable situation made it difficult to take people there\u201d. The officials said they believed \u201cthe time to provide a tour to the media was appropriate now\u201d.*\n\nSo why now after 43 days?\n\nPakistan was under a lot of global scrutiny post the IAF\u2019s strikes because of the info blackout it had imposed around the Jabba top JeM camp. It was waiting for the right opportunity to reveal the innards of the camps to the outside world on its terms.\n\n43 days were needed for the massive coverup operation towards\u2014 disposal the bodies and the evidence, rectifying the massive internal damage in the targeted building, getting the locals on board and plan the next move. Interestingly, a quality work force was most probably pushed in at night to get the infrastructure sorted out after the massive internal damage in the targeted building.\n\n43 days is a good time to build an alternate global narrative and push in an agenda which suits ISPR. Basically, 43 days is a long time to hide an inconvenient truth. This is classic ISPR \u2014 Delay, Confuse, Deny!!!\n\nIncidentally this was the first formal visit to the area by media \u2014 and the trip intended to fortify Pakistan\u2019s firm stance that India had failed.\n\nAnyway, continuing with the BBC reporter\u2019s account, he said *the place (the camp) was isolated and away from human habitation.* Something to ponder over here \u2014 Does the Pakistani state open its Madrassas for minors in isolated places, far from worthy habitations? Remember, it took the media team more than 90 minutes to reach the place by foot and a good hour in their vehicles before that.\n\nThe signboard of the JeM\u2019s Madrassa Ul Quran on the turning to the JeM camp/ Wion news\n\n*On their way to the madrassa, which was claimed to have been destroyed by India, the media team was shown three different places. They were told that IAF dropped the payload there, and the correspondent says only a few craters and uprooted trees could be noticed.* The explanation of this issue has been dealt in detail here.\n\nOne of the 3 craters indicated by the Pak Army to the media team as from IAF bombs which missed the target.\n\nThe close up on one of the craters clearly establishes a HE warhead explosion pattern\n\nThe long and short of it is that \u2014 IAF used the penetrator version of the Spice 2000 on this raid. The shown craters were classic tell-tale signs of high yield explosive in the order of 400\u2013500 kg, as usually found on 1000 kg HE bombs \u2014 and NOT of a penetrator bomb, which would have dug in 3\u20134 meters deep in the earth, creating a huge mudpile around it with its high momentum and low yield explosion. The image below from a Russian bunker buster in Syria highlights the same.\n\nA penetrator bomb\u2019s site will show a result like this, which is unlike that of the Balakot craters\n\nUnlike a classic high yield explosive, the penetrator version digs deep and explodes a low yield warhead\n\nSo if the IAF didn\u2019t do it, who did it?\n\nThe Pak Army\u2019s lie on the Balakot raid stands exposed! Having carried out controlled explosions within the first few hours of the strike, the Pak Army changed the narrative to show that the IAF missed its objectives on Jabba top, little knowing that the IAF had used penetrator bombs instead of conventional explosives.\n\nPost entry into the complex, *The team was then taken to the hill top where the madrassa is located. The BBC scribe said that \u201clooking at the structure, it did not look like newly-built, or they suffered any damage in the attack\u201d.* Yes the BBC reporter was correct, because the large structure was never targeted!\n\nThe entry to the biggest building in the complex is seen on the left\n\nThe entire building was still intact, and some of its parts looked quite old, and in the adjacent mosque hall, 150\u2013200 children were studying.* Yes, this statement is correct, as also seen in the DG ISPR\u2019s video. The big structure and the Madrassa were not targeted and hence are of their vintage construction.\n\nWhat is noticeable is that all the JeM propoganda material in the hall as well as other places in the camp from before has been viped clean.\n\nThere is certainly more to this than what meets the eye, especially bought out by the NTRO\u2019s detection of over 300 mobiles active in the camp before the strikes, which cannot be these innocent children and their care takers.\n\nA whiteboard was also encountered by this media team, which displayed the message that the Madrassa would be closed from 27 to 14 March.\n\nA message denotes in Urdu that the Madrassa would be closed from 27\u201314 March\n\nIt is necessary to go through the following photographs of the JeM camp, which have been taken from an Indian Intelligence dossier \u2014 giving us the real evidence of activities happening at Balakot before the IAF\u2019s strike.\n\nThe same room in an Indian Intelligence dossier, indicating the JeM propaganda material\n\nOn the left is the entrance to the camp\n\nThere is NO sign of children as was visible during the recent media visit\n\nIn a statement on Pakistan news channels Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor said,\u201cVisitors freely interacted with students, children and teachers and saw for themselves that the madrassa stood on ground untouched with only innocent local children receiving education.\n\nI have a healthy respect for the professionalism of the Pak Armed Forces, but the DG ISPR takes the threshold of deceit and crookedness to a new low! Only the ISPR could have used innocent minors to deflect the the real purpose of the camp through a well crafted campaign of subterfuge and lies built around a fictitious account of welfare and peace in the region.\n\nMaj Gen Asif Ghafoor is at the forefront of Pak Army\u2019s disinformation campaign against India\n\nWhen Major General Asif Ghafoor, the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the armed forces\u2019 media wing, was asked about journalists spotting the name of Maulana Yusuf Azhar \u2014 the brother-in-law of JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar \u2014 on the madrassa board, he did not give a direct answer. He said they were looking into the funding of the madrassa, and focusing on the courses provided there.* Major General Asif Ghafoor did not give a direct answer, because he did not have a direct answer. How could a serving Major General of the Pakistan Army justify \u2014 that the man who helped fund this very Madrassa \u2014 was a major kingpin in one of the deadliest terrorist organisations of the world, which recently had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack on Indian CRPF personnel at Pulwama, J&K on 14 February, killing 40 of them in cold blood.\n\nExposing the ISPR\u2019s lie on the Media team visit\n\nBefore we expose how the DG ISR twisted facts during his visit to the JeM camp, its important to understand the geographical layout of the camp, as well as the building which was \u2018actually\u2019 targeted by the IAF.\n\nLayout of the JeM terror camp at Jabba top, Balakot\n\nThe JeM camp has the above mentioned buildings \u2014 where the Madrassa complex with three clearly shown buildings, including the largest of them, is located next to the mosque. This was NOT a target.\n\nThe IAF has confirmed to the author that the main target of the IAF\u2019s raid was the Trainee Accommodation (Mujahid hostel) located at Latitude North 34 deg, 27 min, 53 sec, and Longitude East, 73 deg, 19 min, 04 sec; at the north edge of the camp. 3 Spice 2000 bombs landed precisely within 3 m CEP at 0330H on 26 February on the roof of this building.\n\nThe DG ISPR, Major General Asif Ghafoor has blatantly fooled the world and the independent media group \u2014 by conducting their visit to the JeM camp under a bundle of, pardon me for using the word a thousandth time \u2014 lies!!!\n\nThe DG ISPR conducted the visit of the independent observers to the JeM camp and \u2014 DID NOT show them the targeted building, which in spite of a speedy rebuild if there was one, would have left innocuous signs of a major trauma like a bomb hit. To reinforce Pakistan\u2019s version of the narrative \u2014 that the IAF strikes have failed, the DG ISPR took the team only to the Madrassa buildings as is evident from the video posted on twitter. These had not been targeted by the IAF, hence would be in their original state \u2014 which Major General Asif Ghafoor pivoted around to prove to the world \u2014 that they had not been hit by the IAF. Only the ISPR can lie with such a panache right under the noses of independent observers from various other nations, intimidating and demeaning the intelligence and dignity of most of them. It is evident that No member of the team was allowed to conduct any manner of meaningful independent verification by speaking to the locals or roam around freely in the camp \u2014 especially near the targeted building. The Pak Army showed the craters of the IAF\u2019s missed bombs, which are not in sync with the penetrator bombs used by the IAF to target Jabba top on 26 February. Obviously, these were controlled explosions carried out by Pak Army to mislead the world \u2014 Another lie exposed. The DG ISPR clouded the visit by displaying minor children as part of his plot in an attempt to spin a new narrative regarding their studies and care in this remote region. About 150 students, aged 12\u201313, were present inside the seminary building and were being taught Quran, when the group reached inside the madrassa. This was the first formal visit to the area by foreign media \u2014 The aim of the trip was to fortify Pakistan\u2019s firm stance that India had failed! However no meaningful member from the Indian media was invited to be part of this entourage, diluting the very purpose of the visit. As someone who tracks the Major General\u2019s activities well, tweeted -\n\nThe ISPR\u2019s failed Antithesis of a successful strike\n\nIndian Air Force carried out precision strikes on the JeM camp at Balakot. Post that, ISPR has tried to hard sell a bunch of lies indicating that the IAF\u2019s offensive action has failed.\n\nThis antithesis involves a covert cover up of the events at Jabba top through a well executed plan. One question will haunt the Pakistanis for a good while \u2014 Why did the ISPR wait for 43 days?\n\n43 days post the strikes \u2014 the DG ISPR personally led an expedition with so called independent media and foreign observers to the Jabba top and \u2014 intentionally mislead them by asking them to examine buildings \u2014 which had NOT been targeted by the IAF.\n\nInterestingly like many occasions in the past, Major General Asif Ghafoor\u2019s lies and deception during this media visit \u2014 was exposed by his very own narrative and the video feed uploaded on twitter \u2014 which showed enough evidence on his intentions. This was corroborated by other members of the independent military teams as part of the group.\n\nIts high time that the smart alecks at ISPR need to take heed of the fact that \u2014 It isn\u2019t the original event that gets people in the most trouble \u2014 it\u2019s the attempted cover-up. And the DG ISPR has given far more \u2014 than what he has gained from the affair since the Balakot strikes, thanks to his exposed lies and rampant flip flops. Hopefully, the Chief of the Pak Army will take the matter in his hand sooner than later, toning down the unethical ride of ISPR \u2014 which is fast becoming the infamous ambassador of myriad lies and blatant deception, hell bent on creating widespread misunderstandings between two nuclear armed powers on the brink of an all out war.\n\nAs far as India is concerned, Thank God for our form of government \u2014 The media won\u2019t let there be any cover-up.\n\nIt's evident though\u2014 that there will be no Event Horizon on the Balakot affair any time soon.\n\nISPR is nowhere close to its Veni, Vidi, Vici moment on this matter!\n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\n***The author is an former fighter pilot with extensive experience on the Mirage 2000 and MiG 21 aircraft of the IAF.

In early August, U.S. President Donald Trump approved a defense budget law delaying delivery of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets to Turkey. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), quickly approved by Congress, prohibits F-35 sales to Turkey until the Pentagon issues a report on Turkish-American relations in 90 days.\n\nStill, the F-35 Joint Program Office announced on Aug. 16 that it would continue to execute current program plans with all partners, including Turkey, and to abide by any future policy guidelines.\n\nTurkey has been in the F-35 program since 1999, and the Turkish defense industry has taken an active role in the production of aircraft and invested $1.25 billion in the aircraft's development. Alp Aviation, AYESAS, Kale Aviation, Kale Pratt & Whitney and Turkish Aerospace Industries have been producing parts for the first F-35 fighter jet.\n\nTurkey plans to purchase 100 F-35 fighter jets in the coming years. Out of 100 aircraft, 30 have been approved. The country took delivery of its first F-35 fighter jet at a ceremony in Fort Worth, Texas, on June 21. The first F-35 aircraft delivered is also the first fifth-generation fighter jet to enter the Turkish Air Force Command inventory.\n\nEach CH-47 helicopter has two rotors and two motors, each having 4,800 horsepower. With a range that can increase to 1,100 kilometers with the help of the fuel tanks, the helicopters can fly safely even at conditions of zero visibility.\n\nThe helicopters, which can carry 10 tons, can be used in war operations and operations with humanitarian and civil aims."

    "text": "The Algerian military is operating the TOS-1A thermobaric rocket launcher, with the weapon system seen during a recent exercise.\n\nThe TOS-1A Solntsepek (Sunheat) was first seen during the Majd 2017 exercise in July. According to Russian media, the Russian engineering company Omsktransmash confirmed the delivery during the Army 2017 defence exhibition in Russia last week. A source at NPO Splav, which specialises in multiple rocket launchers, also confirmed the acquisition.\n\nAccording to Mena Defense, the TOS-1A has been in Algerian service for almost two years. The system has also been exported to Azerbaijan, Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe TOS-1A, using a T-72 or T-90 tank chassis, fires up to 24 220 mm rockets with thermobaric warheads, which are also known as fuel air explosives. These release a cloud of flammable liquid into the air, and use the oxygen in the atmosphere to combust it, producing a stronger and hotter blast than conventional explosives. Because they ignite the oxygen in the air, thermobaric warheads also create a partial vacuum, making them an effective weapon against caves, bunkers and tunnels.\n\nThe TOS-1A has a minimum range of 600 metres and a maximum range of six kilometres. Targets are sighted with an optical sight, laser rangefinder and ballistic computer.\n\nThe acquisition of the TOS-1A is another purchase by Algeria, which was recently confirmed as being a Buk-2ME surface-to-air missile system operator. This was also revealed during the Majd 2017 exercise. The Buk-M2E (SA-17 Grizzly) is a medium-range air defence missile designed and manufactured by Almaz-Antey. It can be used against aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. Up to 24 targets can be engaged simultaneously. Effective range is over 20 km.\n\nAnother relatively new weapon seen in Algerian service is the Chinese PLZ45 155 mm self-propelled howitzer. 50 of these were delivered in 2014.\n\nRecent Algerian weapons deliveries, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), include T-90 main battle tanks, Umkhonto-IR surface-to-air missiles, Su-30MKA fighter aircraft, Tigr armoured vehicles, Mokopa and 9M120/AT-9 anti-tank missiles, 9M311/SA-19 surface-to-air missiles, Fuchs armoured personnel carriers and Meko frigates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria also has some domestic capabilities, and is building armoured vehicles and soft-skinned military vehicles under license (including Fuchs armoured personnel carriers and Mercedes utility vehicles) and has installed artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns on wheeled vehicles. Earlier this month it commissioned into service another domestically manufactured corvette, the Rais Hassen Barbier."

    "text": "TEL AVIV: As the US tightens its terms for financing the Israeli military, one of America\u2019s closest allies is beginning to sell its weapons to the US, instead of the other way around.\n\nMPR 500 Bombs\n\nJust last week, US-based Orbital ATK and Israel\u2019s IMI Systems announced a teaming agreement to supply a version of IMI\u2019s 500-lb Multi-Purpose Rigid Bomb (MPR 500) family of munitions for the US Air Force.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this relationship will lead to future product enhancements and additional opportunities for Orbital ATK and IMI Systems to collaborate,\u201d said Pat Nolan, vice president and general manager of missile products at Orbital\u2019s Defense Systems Group.\n\nThe MPR-500 is used on several different Israeli fighter aircraft. In conjunction with GPS or laser guidance, it\u2019s designed to improve strikes in dense urban environments and in close proximity to friendly forces, while reducing collateral damage and risk to non-combatants. The new bomb is designed to penetrate multiple floors and detonate its fragmenting high-explosive warhead inside buildings, destroying hidden targets. That allows planners to target a specific floor, while leaving the rest of a building relatively safe.\n\nIMI says that the weapon maintains its structural integrity throughout its path; eliminating breakup or jittering that has often been encountered with standard GP bombs, which increases the risk of duds or collateral damage. IMI claims that MPR-500 offers over 90 percent reliability operating against such hard targets.\n\nIron Dome & Tamir\n\nA letter signed by 40 Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives urged appropriators to consider purchasing the Israeli Iron Dome rocket interceptor for American use. In Israel, Iron Dome intercepts incoming rockets, artillery, and mortar shells aimed mainly at civilian targets; since the US homeland isn\u2019t in range of such tactical weapons, an American Iron Dome would primarily protect frontline forces and forward bases.\n\nFor these missions, however, the US Army seems committed to its own Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC). However, the Army has test-fired the Iron Dome\u2019s Tamir interceptor from IPFC\u2019s Multi-Mission Launcher (MML), which is designed to fire a wide array of different interceptors. (See video above.) Raytheon has teamed with Rafael to build the Tamir, which kills incoming threats launched from ranges of up to 70 km.\n\nIron Dome has a remarkable track record: It\u2019s the world\u2019s most used missile defense system, intercepting more than 1,500 targets with a greater than 90 percent success rate since being fielded in 2011. I can say from my own experience that, during the Protective Edge operation in Gaza in 2015, when rockets were launched into Israel, it was very comforting to hear the sound of a Hamas rocket exploding overhead after being hit by Iron Dome.\n\nThe system is effective day or night and in all weather conditions, including low clouds, rain, dust storms and fog. It features a first-of-its-kind multi-mission launcher, which is designed to fire a variety of interceptor missiles, depending on the threat \u2014 similar to the American MML still in development.\n\nRafael is now completing development of the C-Dome, a naval system derived from the Iron Dome designed to protect ships from all aerial threats. C-Dome handles saturation attacks by engaging multiple incoming threat simultaneously. C-Dome components include a multi-round launcher assembly loaded with vertically-launched canistered interceptors, installed under the ship\u2019s deck.\n\nWill Rafael offer C-Dome to the U.S military? \u201cIf Raytheon makes this version a locally-made system, this option looks very realistic,\u201d a Ministry of Defense source tells Breaking Defense. Rafael refused to comment.\n\nEitan Armored Personnel Carrier\n\nSources in the Israeli Defense Ministry point to the Israeli-developed Eitan eight-wheel drive armored personnel carrier (APC) as another candidate. Israel recently approved the production of hundreds of the Eitan APCs.\n\nDefense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said after the Eitan was approved that it would dramatically improve Israeli capabilities within a decade, equipping IDF ground forces with hundreds of armored APCs with capabilities including an Active Protection System (APS) to shoot down incoming anti-tank weapons.\n\nIn fact, Brig. Gen. Guy Paglin, head of the Defense Ministry\u2019s tank and APC directorate, said that the Eitan will be the world\u2019s best protected armored vehicle: \u201cIt will have excellent combat capabilities that were tested in the past year in all the combat (sectors), from north to south.\u201d\n\nThe Eitan is the first wheeled 8\u00d78 APC developed in Israel, with the prototype first publicly unveiled in 2016. The IDF plans to gradually replace its very old tracked M113 APCs with a new armored vehicle. A prototype of the Eitan was first publicly unveiled in 2016.\n\nThe Eitan will be fitted with Rafael\u2019s Trophy APS, and Israeli sources tell Breaking Defense that other weapon systems will also be mounted on the wheeled APC. Sources in the Defense Ministry say that it will make sense to transfer production to the U.S .\n\nWill this open the U.S market for a version of this advanced APC? A Ministry of Defense source, asked about this, smiled and said: \u201cProduction in the U.S of an Israeli system is a different opera.\u201d Currently the US Army is doubling down on its investment in a different 8\u00d78 APC, the US-built Stryker, itself a variant of the widely sold Swiss MOWAG Piranha. The Strykers are slated to get bigger guns, upgraded underbody armor, and US-built active protection systems. For its part, the IDF had tested the Stryker but decided that it did not meet its requirements.\n\nCould a variant of Eitan be built in the US? Already, many components of two Israeli tracked vehicles, the Merkava 4 Main Battle Tank and the Namer heavy APC, are made in the US. In fact, some 60 percent of the Namer is made in the US, including the chassis. General Dynamics is the lead US contractor, but dozens more US companies are also involved in the program. In the case of the Eitan APC, involvement by US industry is expected to be even greater than in the Namer project.\n\nSo when the amount of local currency available from US grants will limit the production of the Eitan in Israel, transferring the production to the U.S is an idea that is in the air in all relevant parties.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9eF22kVN46g?t=8s\n\nHero-30 & Hero-400EC Loitering Weapon\n\nThree years ago, Raytheon teamed with Israeli company Uvision in an attempt to get orders to supply the Israeli-developed Hero-30 loitering weapon system \u2014 essentially, a kamikaze drone \u2014 to the U.S Army, under the Army\u2019s Lethal Miniature Aerial Missile Systems (LMAMS) . The tender is aimed at the purchase of 25,000 loitering weapon systems over 15 years. If the Hero-30 is selected, Raytheon will serve as the main contractor, according to the contract.\n\nUvision also has a larger version of the loitering weapons system, the Hero 400 EC, unveiled last year. This variant has a unique cruciform aerodynamic design which, according to the Israeli company, delivers high-accuracy and reduces collateral damage.\n\nUvision says that the Hero 400 EC\u2019s electric motor enables it to loiter silently above a target, ready to instantly respond to threats. According to Noam Levitt, UVision\u2019s CEO, the system was developed to answer a growing requirement for a loitering weapons system that can remain in the air for extended periods, provide a substantial warhead effective against a wide variety of targets, and deliver missile-level pinpoint strike capabilities. Will that version also be evaluated by the U.S armed forces? Uvision refused to answer questions about this option.\n\nTrophy and Iron Fist Active Protection Systems\n\nOne system the US Army is already buying: Rafael\u2019s Trophy Active Protection System, which shoots down incoming anti-tank weapons before they impact. Trophy is the only battle-tested APS in the Western world, though Russia has used its own APS to great effect in Ukraine. The IDF has installed Trophy on its Merkava heavy tanks and now the US is buying four brigades\u2019 worth for its M1 Abrams, with Chief of Staff Mark Milley pledging to eventually equip all armored brigades.\n\nMeanwhile the US is testing a rival Israeli APS, IMI\u2019s Iron Fist, on its M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. Installing APS on a Bradley is harder than on a tank, because the Bradley\u2019s electrical system has less available power \u2014 crews in Iraq often had to shut down some systems before turning others on \u2014 and the vehicle\u2019s capacity to take more weight is lower as well. But if Iron Fist passes US testing, which is not a foregone conclusion, it will probably equip the Bradleys in the same four brigades whose tanks are getting Trophy, and possibly many more units as well.\n\n\u201cThe intent is to outfit the entire heavy force, all of our vehicles, all the ground vehicles \u2014 the Bradleys, the tanks, any future combat vehicles \u2014 with active protective systems,\u201d Gen. Milley told the Senate. \u201cActive protection systems are manufactured only in\u2026three (countries) right now. (One is) Russia, which we\u2019re not going to get them from. (The others are) Israel and the United States, and the companies in the United States, they\u2019re not ready yet for full rate production.\u201d That could mean big business for Israeli firms.\n\nSydney Freedberg contributed to this article."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nThe budget allocated is far short of the money the IAF has committed to pay for purchasing aircraft. It will need a mid-year bail out.\n\nNew Delhi: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has projected that it may not be able to make tranche payments (akin to EMIs) for its past purchases in fiscal 2018-19, as adequate resources haven\u2019t been allotted by the finance ministry.\n\nThe projection underlines the crisis that an increasingly lopsided defence budget has brought to the defence services.\n\nThe IAF has been allocated Rs 35,755 crore for the next fiscal year, a sum that top officials say falls well short of the amount it has to pay for purchases made in the past few years, including for systems such as the Rafale fighter jets, Apache attack choppers and Chinook heavy lift helicopters.\n\nAll these aircraft are to be delivered by 2019-2020, but part payments need to be made every year as they go through the production cycle in France and the US, and training and associated activities commence from the Indian side.\n\nWith the allocated budget short of its committed liabilities, the IAF will need to apply for special budgetary sanctions mid-year, throwing its financial planning out of gear. Sources said that the Air Force could be short by as much as Rs 14,000 crore, but that special provisions will be made later in the year to ensure that all commitments are honoured.\n\nEmpty pockets\n\nSenior officials say that while every year the allocated budget is far short of what the services project as expenses, this is the first time in recent memory that it will fall short of the \u2018compulsory payments\u2019 that need to be made.\n\nIn 2017-18 for example, official records show that the IAF requested the finance ministry for Rs 62,049 crore under the capital head, as it had planned to make payments for the Rafale fighter jets and associated components. However, given financial constraints, the service was allotted just 54 per cent of this sum (Rs 33,570 crore).\n\nAs reported by ThePrint, the Indian defence budget is now dangerously skewed as the revenue bill has zoomed over the years. The sustained manpower-intensive nature of the services has resulted in a situation where resources available for modernisation of the forces are far outstripped by the allocations required for paying salaries and pensions to soldiers.\n\nReports of the parliamentary standing committee on defence show a steady decline in the capital budget of the defence ministry. From 2007, when the ministry spent 41 per cent of its money on capital expenses, the ratio was down to 32 per cent in 2016-17.\n\nA shrinking capital budget means that the money available to initiate new purchases has reduced \u2013 in the case of the Army, for example, the money available for new purchases in 2016-17 was Rs 2,080 crore, or just 14 per cent of its total capital share.\n\nWhat can be done to fix this?\n\nThe parliamentary standing committee on defence, headed by BJP veteran Maj. Gen. (retd) B.C. Khanduri, has been a strong advocate of creating a non-lapsable, rollover fund for modernisation of the armed forces.\n\nThis would collect all unspent amounts from the defence capital budget at the end of a financial year into a corpus that can be used for future purchases.\n\nWhile this concept was given a go ahead by the defence ministry last year, the finance ministry has resisted all moves to set it up. Sources said that the standing committee is set to make a fresh bid to set up this fund in its next reports that are to be tabled in Parliament shortly.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "The Council of Ministers on Friday approved a draft budget for 2018, which calls for significant increases in government spending. Jenni Reid\n\nGovernment proposes $6B budget for 2018\n\nThe Council of Ministers on Friday approved a national budget for next year that calls for more than $6 billion in spending, the largest increase ever proposed for the Kingdom, with big boosts for education, defence and the arts.\n\nIn an executive summary of the draft law released on Friday, the Council of Ministers proposes raising the budget by nearly $1 billion, stating that the budget increases are necessary to run the Senate and national elections next year and to improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe royal government must ensure both elections will be smooth, orderly, correct, free and fair,\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn addition, the money is also needed \u201cto ensure defence, peace and social stability\u201d in order to prevent \u201cany tricks and any kinds of attempts to make the country fall into chaos and instability\u201d.\n\nThe proposal will go to the National Assembly by the end of the week \u2013 the second time in as many years that the legislative body is forced to decide the budget amid significant political turmoil.\n\nCambodia National Rescue Party President Party President Kem Sokha is currently in pretrial detention on \u201ctreason\u201d charges, while Prime Minister Hun Sen has alleged the party as a whole is involved in a plot to topple the CPP-led government.\n\nLast year, the CPP-controlled National Assembly voted in favour of a $5 billion budget for 2017 in the absence of CNRP lawmakers, who boycotted in protest of a number of politically charged legal cases against their colleagues.\n\nIf the proposal is accepted, the Ministry of Education will see the single biggest funding boost, of roughly $167 million, or 24 percent. The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Health are also set to receive sizeable increases of 17 and 15 percent, respectively, or $80 million and $63 million.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts would see the single largest percentage increase, more than doubling from $20 million this year to a proposed budget of $47 million.\n\nReached yesterday, CNRP lawmaker Mao Monyvann said he had not yet seen the full budget but $6 billion seemed to be \u201ctoo much\u201d. He said the focus of the budget-makers should be on increasing funding transparency and boosting education.\n\n\u201cTo stay within budget, we suggest more transparency,\u201d Monyvann said. \u201c[For example], before approving any government projects, please have public bidding.\u201d\n\nCambodia\u2019s budget process has been criticised in the past by good governance NGOs, such as International Budget Partners (IBP), for lacking detail and transparency. Since 2015, however, the process has improved, according to IBP\u2019s metrics, with year-end reports now produced for internal use and audits made available to the public, among other reforms. Nonetheless, full budget proposals are typically not made public before passage of the law.\n\nCouncil of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan said that the budget hikes were justified, pointing to needs in the education sector and for recruitment of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe need it,\u201d Siphan said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t need it, why would we increase it?\u201d\n\nSee last year's budget here.\n\nSan Chey, head of the Affiliated Network for Social Accountability Cambodia, expressed concern that the budget process is moving too quickly in an uncertain political climate, with NGOs and lawmakers lacking the opportunity for input.\n\n\u201cThe tense political situation impedes the opposition party from having the opportunity to check and evaluate 2018 national budgets,\u201d Chey said.\n\nAccording to the Council of Ministers, the budget will also fund several initiatives announced by Prime Minister Hun Sen in recent speeches \u2013 including pledges to fund salary increases for civil servants, pregnancy care for garment workers and tax breaks for people who earn less than $300 per month.\n\nThe council did not explain how much the government is budgeting for those initiatives.\n\nSiphan said more detailed questions about the budget would have to wait until the full proposal is sent to the National Assembly for debate. Instead of having the chance to give their input directly, NGOs can try to persuade assembly representatives, he said.\n\n\u201cThey could voice their opinion on what they want and what they don\u2019t agree with to the National Assembly,\u201d he said."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump finalized an $854 billion spending bill on Friday that fully funds the military for fiscal 2019 and prevents a government shutdown next week, accomplishments that congressional leaders have called important and laudable.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s signature came with one final attack on Democrats over the spending measure, lamenting lawmakers\u2019 decision not to include extra money in the appropriations package for his planned wall along the southern U.S. border.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the radical Democrats refuse to support border security and want drugs and crime to pour into our country,\u201d he said in a statement after signing the bill.\n\nNo shutdown: House finalizes FY19 military budget, and Trump drops his opposition The president says he will sign the funding measure, which gives the military its full-year budget on schedule for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe comments came just a week after Trump took to social media to blast \u201cthis ridiculous Spending Bill,\u201d raising fears of a presidential veto on Capitol Hill. Instead, Trump largely praised the measure on Friday, calling it \u201cimportant legislation to rebuild our military\u201d and promote other domestic priorities.\n\nThe appropriations measure includes $674 billion in defense funding for fiscal 2019, and marks the first time in a decade Congress has finalized the spending measure before the start of the new fiscal year.\n\nThe measure funds a 2.6 percent pay raise for troops starting next January and a boost in military end strength of 16,400 spread across the active-duty and reserve forces.\n\nTrump, in his statement, praised the measure for including \u201c93 new F-35 Lightning Joint Strike Fighters, 142 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, and 13 Navy battle force ships \u2014 made right here in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIn a statement after the signing, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, praised the president for pushing for the funding increases in his budget request and past public statements.\n\n\u201cBy funding our military in full and on time, we can begin to restore its strength, agility, and effectiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I have said before, the task before us now is to make full, on time funding of our military the rule in Washington, and not the exception.\u201d\n\nThe spending bill also includes full-year funding for the departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Labor, as well as bridge funding for a handful of other government agencies to keep them operational through Dec. 7.\n\nLast week, Trump signed into law a separate package that included full-year funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs and for military construction projects."

    "text": "Pentagon and Lockheed Martin Deliver 300th F-35 Aircraft\n\nF-35 Enterprise Ramps Up Production and Reduces Costs\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas, June 11, 2018 / PRNewswire / -- The F-35 Joint Program Office and Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] delivered the 300th production F-35 aircraft, demonstrating the program's continued progress and momentum. The 300th aircraft is a U.S. Air Force F-35A, to be delivered to Hill Air Force Base, Utah.\n\n\"The F-35 weapons system is a key enabler of our National Defense Strategy and is providing our warfighters the combat proven, advanced capabilities they need to meet mission requirements,\" said Vice Admiral Mat Winter, program executive officer for the F-35 Joint Program Office. \"The 300th production aircraft delivery is a significant milestone that highlights the effective F-35 Enterprise collaboration across the JPO, U.S. services, partners and industry. Moving forward, our F-35 team remains committed to driving costs down, quality up and faster delivery timelines across our development, production and sustainment lines of effort.\"\n\nThe first 300 F-35s include 197 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variants, 75 F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variants, and 28 F-35C carrier variants (CV) and have been delivered to U.S. and international customers. More than 620 pilots and 5,600 maintainers have been trained, and the F-35 fleet has surpassed more than 140,000 cumulative flight hours.\n\n\"This milestone is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our joint government and industry team as we collaborate to deliver transformational F-35 capabilities to the men and women in uniform,\" said Greg Ulmer, Lockheed Martin vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. \"We are focused on reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and ensuring the highest level of quality as we ramp to full rate production and sustainment of the operational fleet.\"\n\nIncreasing Production, Reducing Costs\n\nAs production volume increases and additional efficiencies are implemented, Lockheed Martin is on track to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, which is equal to or less than legacy 4th generation aircraft. With the incorporation of lessons learned, process efficiencies, production automation, facility and tooling upgrades, supply chain initiatives and more, the F-35 enterprise has already significantly reduced costs and improved efficiency. For example:\n\nThe price of an F-35A has come down more than 60 percent from the first contract.\n\nTouch labor has been reduced by about 75 percent over the last five years.\n\nProduction span time has decreased by about 20 percent since 2015.\n\nThe F-35 enterprise met its 2017 delivery target of 66 aircraft, representing more than a 40 percent increase from 2016. In 2018, the team is targeting 91 aircraft deliveries and is preparing to increase production volume year-over-year to hit a rate of approximately 160 aircraft in 2023.\n\nEconomic Impact\n\nThe F-35 is built by thousands of men and women in America and around the world. With more than 1,500 suppliers in 46 states and Puerto Rico, the F-35 program supports more than 194,000 direct and indirect jobs in the U.S. alone. The program also includes more than 100 international suppliers, creating or sustaining thousands of international jobs.\n\nWith stealth technology, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, weapons capacity and range, the F-35 is the most lethal, survivable and connected fighter aircraft ever built. More than a fighter jet, the F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data is a powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace and enables men and women in uniform to execute their mission and return home safe.\n\nFor additional information, visit www.f35.com .\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\nSOURCE Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company"

    "text": "During 2017 Russia exported some $15 billion worth of weapons around the world. This included African nations, which received an array of equipment from fighter jets to ballistic missiles \u2013 Africa accounted for 13% of Russian arms sales over the last five years.\n\nAccording to Russia\u2019s Kommersant newspaper, and confirmed at a meeting of the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation with Foreign States on 5 March, Russia in 2017 received orders for $16 billion worth of defence equipment, bringing Russia\u2019s order book to $45 billion. Most equipment went to China, India and Vietnam, which ordered helicopters, engines, and vessels.\n\nA number of African countries took delivery of military hardware from Russia last year, such as long-time customer Algeria. It received the last six of 14 Su-30MKA fighters; six more Mi-28NE attack helicopters (42 were ordered in 2013) and T-90SA tanks (out of an order for 200).\n\nAlthough not mentioned by the Commission for Military-Technical Cooperation, Algeria has also recently acquired TOS-1 rocket launchers and Buk-M2E surface-to-air missiles and ordered BMPT Terminator tank support vehicles from Russia, while it is expecting delivery of Kilo class submarines.\n\nAlgeria\u2019s receipt of four Iskander-E short range ballistic missiles was confirmed. The system has a range of around 300 km with a 480 kg warhead (fragmentation, blast fragmentation or penetration warheads). Each launch vehicle carries two missiles and each missile regiment includes around thirty vehicles (launchers, loaders, command, logistics vehicles etc.). Algeria is the second export customer for the system after Armenia.\n\nEgypt is another important African customer, and in 2017 began receiving the first of 46 MiG-29M/M2 fighters that were ordered in December 2015 \u2013 15 were delivered last year. Egypt also received 19 Ka-52 attack helicopters, out of an order for 46 for the Egyptian Air Force. The country has yet to decide on ordering the navalised Ka-52K for the Egyptian Navy\u2019s Mistral class landing helicopter docks (LHDs).\n\nAlthough not mentioned by the Commission, Russia last year also began delivering S-300VM missiles to Egypt and AT-9 and AT-16 anti-tank missiles for its Ka-52s. It has expressed interest in T-90 tanks and Buyan class corvettes.\n\nOther deliveries to the continent in 2017 included a single Mi-17V-5 to Kenya (for its police); two Mi-35Ms to Nigeria (out of 12 ordered in September 2015); two Mi-35Ms to Mali (apparently two more are on order for delivery by 2019) and the first of 18 refurbished Su-30Ks to Angola (originally the order was for 12 but another six ex-Indian Air Force examples have been added).\n\nAnother contract that was confirmed was for two Pantsyr-S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) air defence systems for Equatorial Guinea. This is armed with twelve 57E6 surface-to-air guided missiles and two 2A38M30-millimetre automatic guns developed from the two-barreled 30mm GSh-30 gun.\n\nNot mentioned by the Commission was an order announced in August last year for two Mi-171Sh armed helicopters for Burkina Faso\u2019s military.\n\nAccording to Kommersant, Russia expects its 2018 order book to be roughly the same as last year, although possibly a bit lighter due to American sanctions.\n\n\u201cRussia matches high standards and confirms its status of one of the leading providers on the world weapons market,\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week. \u201cThe scope of our military-technical cooperation keeps growing in geographic terms steadily. The number of partners has already exceeded one hundred countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia is the second largest arms exporter after the United States, with a 22% share of the market between 2013 and 2017, compared to the US share of 34%. Third on the list is France with a 6.7% share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian exports of major weapons decreased by 7.1% between 2008\u201312 and 2013\u201317, SIPRI said. \u201cThe fall was largely due to reductions in deliveries to some of its main recipients. Deliveries to Algeria and China, for example, continued throughout 2013\u201317 but were at lower levels than the previous five-year period. Weapons remain on order from Russia for both countries. In addition, while Russia made significant deliveries to Venezuela in 2013, deliveries dropped to nil for the period 2015\u201317.\n\n\u201cRussia has fewer arms export destinations than the USA. In 2013\u201317 Russia delivered major weapons to 47 states and to rebel forces in Ukraine. A total of 58% of Russia\u2019s arms exports went to its top three recipients in 2013\u201317: India, China and Vietnam accounted for 35, 12 and 10%, respectively. At the regional level, Asia and Oceania accounted for 66% of Russian arms exports in 2013\u201317, Africa for 13%, the Middle East for 11%, Europe for 6.2% and the Americas for 4.2%,\u201d SIPRI said."

Thom Tillis.\n\nThe new funds are a sharp contrast to comments Trump made to Fox News after his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s comments seemed to stun NATO member countries, who have been working with the U.S. to increase military rotations and shorten the amount of time it would take for forces to assemble along Europe\u2019s eastern flank to deter against any further Russian incursions. Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017.\n\n\u201cYou know, Montenegro is a tiny country with very strong people... . They are very aggressive people. They may get aggressive, and congratulations, you\u2019re in World War III. But that\u2019s the way it was set up,\" Trump said.\n\nOn Thursday the government of Montenegro issued a response to Trump\u2019s remarks, emphasizing their commitment to NATO and contributions to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, it does not matter how big or small you are, but to what extent you cherish the values of freedom, solidarity and democracy,\u201d the government said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

    "text": "WASHINGTON and LONDON \u2015 The United Kingdom has announced a plan to add \u00a3800 million (U.S. $1.13 billion) to the Ministry of Defence\u2019s budget for the upcoming financial year, as top defense officials acknowledge that the cost to keep Britain\u2019s military in top shape will remain a challenge.\n\nThe vast majority of that funding, \u00a3600 million, will be withdrawn from the \u00a310 billion contingency fund for the Dreadnought submarine program, announced in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review. The contingency is held by the Treasury, which has agreed to release the funds in an effort to keep the \u00a331 billion Trident missile-armed submarine program on track.\n\nA further \u00a3200 million will be added to the budget next year in the \u201cSupplementary Estimates\u201c released by the Treasury in February 2018. While the \u00a3200 million was assigned to the current financial year, the MoD said it had brought forward payments due next year, releasing extra cash for the 2018-19 budget.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement will ensure that the work to rebuild the U.K.\u2019s new, world-class nuclear submarines remains on schedule, and it\u2019s another sign of the deep commitment this government has to keeping our country safe,\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May said during a public appearance Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement comes as the U.K. and its NATO allies have accused Russia of organizing an attempted assassination using a nerve agent on British soil. The ongoing fallout from that issue has included the expulsion of Russian diplomats from 20 countries.\n\nThe issue of funding all of the U.K.\u2019s defense priorities has been underlined since Britain voted to leave the European Union in 2016, which saw the pound\u2019s value drop just as the MoD signed contracts for a series of major modernization programs. At the same time, the speed at which technology is developing means a constant stream of investment is needed to keep up with peer competitors.\n\nTaken together, the reality is that defense is \u201can expensive thing to deliver if you\u2019re in the premier league,\u201d said Gen. Gordon Messenger, vice chief of the Defence Staff. \u201cAnd we\u2019re determined to remain in the premier league.\u201d\n\nAuditors say Britain can\u2019t afford its 10-year defense equipment plan The funding gap for the plan is anywhere between \u00a34.9 billion and \u00a320.8 billion, or as much as U.S. $29.52 billion, according to the National Audit Office.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should be too apologetic about the fact this is a tough gig to try and afford, and what we have to do is make sensible decisions within the budgetary envelope that we are afforded by our government,\u201d Messenger added.\n\nMessenger and Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary of the MoD, laid out their views on the defense budget during an exclusive interview with Defense News on March 27 in Washington, D.C.\n\nFueling fears about affordability, an April 2017 report from a government watchdog warned that the U.K. modernization plan \u201cis at greater risk of becoming unaffordable than at any time since its inception in 2012,\u201d with a potential overrun of \u00a320 billion over the next decade. But Lovegrove downplayed the risk there, noting that the figure assumes an absolute worst-case scenario, including that the pound will remain at extreme lows for the entire 10-year period.\n\nIn terms of the pound, Lovegrove said: \u201cObviously we would hope that it would come back up a bit more because it does represent, if it were to stay at that level forever, a bit more of an affordability challenge.\u201d\n\nBut he asserted the next few years will be unaffected either way, thanks to government hedging on the value of the pound \u2015 and while \u201cat the it\u2019s a pressure, [but] who knows what it will be like in three years\u2019 time?\u201d"

The 55 aircraft include 21 repurposed H225s, and 10 brand new H145s and 24 H125. The contract, which also foresees the setting up of a local training and maintenance centre, was signed in Kiev on 14 July in the presence of Arsen Avakov, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Ukraine, and Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.\n\nThe heavy twin-engine H225 aircraft ordered by Ukraine, for which the French State currently holds economic rights, will be repurposed to suit public services and search & rescue missions for which the aircraft is recognised as a reference helicopter. The H225 features include a takeoff sequence of less than five minutes, an extra long-range capability with auxiliary fuel tanks, and its world-renowned autopilot and upper SAR modes. The first H225 helicopters are expected to land in Kiev before the end of 2018.\n\nA world leader in the EMS segment and parapublic missions, the Airbus H145 is the latest member of its 4-tonne-class twin-engine rotorcraft product range \u2013 with designed-in mission capability and flexibility, especially in high and hot operating conditions.

The aircraft, with its new flat floor can be quickly and easily reconfigured for various missions, including aerial work, firefighting, law enforcement, search and rescue, and passenger transport.\n\nAbout Airbus\n\nAirbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2017 it generated revenues of \u20ac 59 billion restated for IFRS 15 and employed a workforce of around 129,000.

He asked the session to make a record of the project, which it did.With the president\u2019s approval, the fund can be appropriated without approval from Parliament.Fencing was built along 204 km of Myanmar\u2019s 295-km border with Bangladesh in three phases between 2009 and 2015.\u201cIn phase four, an 11.5-mile [18.5-km] fence was put up along the border during the 2016-17 fiscal year. Another 3.2-mile Y-shaped fence topped with barbed wire coils is being built during the 2017-18 fiscal year. Fencing will have been put up along 14.7 miles of border when that work is completed,\u201d Maj-Gen Aung Soe said.The 20 billion kyats from the president\u2019s emergency fund will be used to build a Y-shaped fences topped with barbed wire coils along an additional 18.5 km this fiscal year along with other related infrastructure including a 12.2-meter-wide patrol route along the fence, 161 reinforced concrete conduits and eight buildings including three warehouses.\u201cThe old fences are not strong enough and people can cross over them or remove them. However, we don\u2019t yet know about [the quality of] the new fences. We want better fences so that people from the other side cannot enter illegally. If the fence cannot prevent people on the other side of the border from entering illegally, it will be a waste of money to build a fence. It is the responsibility of the ministries to spend the funding effectively,\u201d said lawmaker U Pe Than, of Rakhine State\u2019s Myebon Township.U Pe Than, a central executive committee member of the Arakan National Party, said the project would be adequately funded but stressed that the ministries had to spend the money effectively because the fence was key to preventing illegal immigration and the threat from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army.The Upper House also made a record of another 1 billion kyats from the president\u2019s emergency fund that the Border Affairs Ministry will use to upgrade two gravel roads connecting Ngakhuya to Zetipyin and the Kyikanpyin junction to the Kyaukpyinseik camp in Rakhine State\u2019s Hla Phoe Khaung Village. The two roads are a combined 18.5 km in length.Border Affairs Deputy Minister Major General Than Htut told the session that the road upgrades would contribute not only to the border area\u2019s security but also to transportation, health, social affairs and the education of local people.The Implementation Committee for Recommendations of the Rakhine State Advisory Commission led by Kofi Annan had instructed authorities to upgrade the roads.Defense Deputy Minister Major General Myint New said his ministry would also spend 5 billion kyats from the emergency fund on renovating 882 buildings belonging to the military\u2019s Western Command that were damaged by Cyclone Mora.\u201cThe damage caused by the natural disaster was inspected by proper teams and 882 out of 1,009 buildings hit by the cyclone will be repaired in the first phase during the 2017-18 fiscal year,\u201d he said.\u201cThe president\u2019s emergency fund was known as the reserve fund in the past,\u201d explained U Khin Cho of the Lower House Public Accounts Committee. \u201cIf the president approves, the fund can be spent without seeking the approval of Parliament. However, it is necessary to inform Parliament of the spending.\u201d[/B]"

(CBC News)\n\nTrump, in a series of speeches recently, has vowed to force allies to pay up, although he sounded somewhat conciliatory on departing Washington on Tuesday.\n\n\"NATO has not treated us fairly, but I think we'll work something out,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We pay far too much and they pay far too little. But we will work it out and all countries will be happy.\"\n\nThe fact Canada has no intention of raising defence spending to two per cent was laid out in the Liberal government's defence policy last year. It forecast hitting 1.4 percent of GDP by 2024.\n\nSeveral times on Tuesday, Trudeau outlined the spending his government plans, including the expected purchase of 88 new fighters for the air force and 15 frigates for the navy.\n\nTrudeau shakes hands with Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis following a bilateral meeting in Riga on Tuesday. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nHe described the NATO target as \"easy shorthand\" and a \"limited tool\" and said Canada is always focused on having the capacity to respond when called upon.\n\nThe argument is not dissimilar to one the former Conservative government made when it faced pressure to ramp up defence spending prior to 2015.\n\nTrudeau received some political backing from Latvian Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis, whose country meets the benchmark and has openly said it is prepared to spend more.\n\nHe said the percentage doesn't matter and it's all about capability.\n\nKucinskis seemed happy to have Canada's commitment to continue to lead one of the three NATO battle groups in the Baltics.\n\n\"Today all of us are a little bit Canadian,\" he told troops at Adazi. \"And we see and we feel that all of the Canadians have become a little bit Latvian.\"\n\nIn addition to announcing the extension, Trudeau revealed that the army will deploy an extra 85 soldiers, many of them logisticians and engineers to help run the battle group.\n\nThe additional commitment will play well at NATO, which is in the process of organizing a division headquarters to co-ordinate the operations in the Baltics.\n\nGen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top military commander, said the additional troops and the extension are welcome."

Two \u2014 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries \u2014 were in the top half of the list.\n\nAmong ongoing programs in which Japanese companies are participating are new wheeled, self-propelled artillery; armored fighting vehicles; and infantry fighting vehicles for the country\u2019s Ground Self-Defense Force, while its Maritime Self-Defense Force is due to receive more ballistic missile defense-capable destroyers, multipurpose destroyers and submarines.\n\nHowever, with concerns over China\u2019s burgeoning military might and the continued threat of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, there is unease that Japan\u2019s increasing reliance on the FMS program for big-ticket defense articles, such as the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ballistic missile defense-related systems, will reduce the share of the defense budget available for homegrown companies.\n\nAccording to Defense Ministry figures, Japan\u2019s spending on FMS purchases has climbed more than tenfold from $390 million in fiscal 2011 to a record high of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2016, although that figure is expected to drop slightly to $3.6 billion in the current fiscal year, according to the ministry.\n\nThe increasing spending on FMS has put pressure on Japan\u2019s policy of building up its domestic defense industry to attain a level of autonomy in meeting its defense needs. The policy has been in place since the 1970s, and yet FMS acquisitions typically have minimal local industry participation.\n\nThis policy of autonomy has seen Japanese industry build all of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force\u2019s ships in service today, and until recently the country was able to build its own fighter aircraft, although that run ended when production of the Mitsubishi F-2, which is a heavily modified and enlarged Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon, ended in 2011.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nJapan launches first ship of new destroyer class The Maya is the first of two 27DDG-class destroyers ordered by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.\n\nIn the long term, however, Japan will need to look at how much autonomy it wants to maintain over its own defense-industrial base, given geopolitical and industrial realities, according to Corey Wallace, an Einstein postdoctoral fellow in the Graduate School of East Asian Studies at Freie Universitat in Berlin, Germany. He said the best approach for Japan is for domestic industry to \u201cbe better integrated into any foreign purchase programs\u201d and to accept cross-national cooperation in the development of certain systems, in effect being selective in the amount of industrial autonomy Japanese companies retain.\n\nOne of the hurdles affecting Japan\u2019s drive toward industrial autonomy is the cost of acquisition and sustainment of indigenous products, which is higher due to Japan\u2019s small, niche defense market and its unique requirements. For example, Bloomberg reported that the country\u2019s Finance Ministry had recommended abandoning production of the Mitsubishi C-2 airlifter in favor of buying the Lockheed C-130J Hercules, which costs half of its Japanese counterpart and is better able to operate from semi-developed airfields, although it carries less cargo and operates at slower speeds.\n\nStill, the Japanese government is keen to support its industrial base. For example, Mitsui and Japan Marine United Corporation managing to secure contracts to build part of eight multipurpose destroyers, despite both companies losing the overall contract to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.\n\nThe government of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also relaxed laws regarding Japanese defense exports, making it easier for Japanese companies to sell defense articles overseas. However, some restrictions remain over which countries Japanese companies can sell to, and Japan has yet to conclude a successful defense export sale since the laws were relaxed in 2014."

    "text": "NEW DELHI: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has begun a project to build IT systems that would help streamline operations and take faster decisions as it looks to increase domestic production of arms and equipment for the armed forces.So far, officials say, lack of a single-technology platform is among the reasons that has affected faster decision making in local procurement and has led India to depend hugely on imports. The technology platform is also being designed for planners in the military to get a single view of expertise of domestic manufacturers in arms and equipment, helping them shortlist vendors. The vendors have the provision to file certifications, products and licences to the defence ministry.\u201cEverything is highly licensed in the defence sector. There are many types of certifications, registrations, etc and they are all highly controlled, but you can make these interfaces smoother by making them IT enabled and creating more transparency, ensuring less corruption and speedier decision making,\u201d Ajay Kumar, Secretary Defence Production, told ET.The department of defence production has set up an in-house IT division to prepare a roadmap on the technology platform. Vendors will have access to projects such as procurement details of equipment on the platform, besides getting clarity on licences and certifications before they bid for contracts.\u201cWe are creating capacity within the department to ensure that wherever there is interface with the industry we will get more online oriented,\u201d Kumar said.While presenting the Union Budget 2018, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that a number of initiatives have been taken to develop and nurture intrinsic defence production capability to make the nation self-reliant for meeting its defence needs. \u201cThe Government will also bring out an industry-friendly Defence Production Policy 2018 to promote domestic production by public sector, private sector and MSMEs,\u201d he said.\u201cOverall, our imports are around 70-75% in terms of value. To change it, we need industry participation and industry needs certainty, transparency, and timeliness\u2026 We can plan, we can make life easier for the industry. The IT interfaces can significantly introduce ease of doing business in the defence sector,\u201d said Kumar.Rahul Chaudhry, chairman of Defence Innovators and Industry Association said, the department of defence and within that the department of defence production has the mandate of facilitating indigenous defence manufacturing and there is a need to have better transparency.\u201cThe IT interface must address their responsibility of creating a market for Indian defence industry especially since only `1.17 crore has been recieved as foreign direct investment in the defence production sector since 2014,\u201d he said.Chaudhry, however, cautioned by saying that the government has to be careful on what it puts online since defence is a strategic sector and we may run the risk of giving away capabilities to rivals."

    "text": "Russian infantry weapons have a reputation for reliability. The AK and PKM are renowned for enduring through adverse conditions, powered by their powerful long-stroke piston actions. However, a recent report by warhead.su suggests that when these weapons do fail in Russian service, the problem is often not in their design, but rather in the Russian ammunition they fire. This is not a new phenomenon. Russian imported ammunition to the United States has always been regarded as \u201cbudget\u201d brands, with inconsistent quality. But apparently, the same problems apply to Russian military ammunition.\n\nThe report opens with a story of a soldier operating a Kord 12.7mm (.50 cal) heavy machine gun. The soldier noticed the belt was a little lighter than usual, and when he pulled the trigger\u2026 the bullet got stuck in the barrel, not even passing the gas port on the barrel. The cause for this is the inconsistencies in Russian powder manufacture. In addition to bullets getting stuck in the barrel (squib), there are stories of guns shooting hotter than usual, and guns exploding due to too much powder being in a cartridge. Of course, for these reasons, Russian domestic ammunition is rarely the ammo of choice for Russian precision shooters.\n\nThe occurrence of these squibs poses a significant reliability problem for all weapons, as they can cause the barrel to explode if the soldier does not realize a squib has been fired and attempts another shot. Given the Russian predilection for automatic modes of fire, this only compounds the problem as a soldier would likely not have time to react before the second round is fired.\n\nRecommended: The Fatal Flaw That Could Take Down an F-22 or F-35.\n\nRecommended: Smith & Wesson's .44 Magnum Revolver: Why You Should Fear the 'Dirty Harry' Gun.\n\nRecommended: 5 Best Shotguns in the World (Winchester, Remington and Beretta Make the Cut).\n\nMoving from powder problems, the report goes on to talk about primer problems. The primer is the small explosive component in the rear of the cartridge that detonates when the firing pin strikes it, setting off the rest of the gunpowder in a cartridge. It usually is placed in the \u201cprimer pocket\u201d in the rear of a cartridge and then sealed with varnish to keep them in place. Russian cartridges also have significant difficulty with this. The primers are inserted in backward or sideways and are sometimes missing the primer itself.\n\nBut those are the least of the primer flaws, being readily visible. Usually soldiers inspect their ammunition as they are loading them into their magazines, and such defects are readily spotted and thrown away. What\u2019s worse is the harder to spot flaws of a protruding primer or defects in the workmanship of the primer itself. Protruding primers pose great danger to soldiers, as the primer can get struck in the magazine, resulting in detonation. This has happened with some Russian ammunition, a picture was provided of a 9x18 Makarov round in a magazine that did this. Russian primers have also proven to prove vulnerable to being punctured, which results in the hot gases of the powder detonating rushing back through the punctured primer onto the bolt face, which can significantly damage the firearm. They also have been known to fall out during the extraction cycle, falling into the fire control group of a firearm. This can potentially cause misfires, or lock up a gun.\n\nOther problems include inconsistent depth of insertion of the bullet. This may cause some of the overpressure problems, but it definitely does not help the consistency of Russian ammunition. There were also issues with some cartridges being totally out of specification\u2014being too long, for example. When combined with an open bolt gun like the Shpagin submachine gun, the results are catastrophic. Because of the fixed firing pin on the bolt of the gun, the cartridge detonated before the bolt was fully locked, destroying the firearm.\n\nThese problems are not only reported on that site. Various videos from Spetsnaz veterans discuss ammunition problems that plagued their service weapons. One of them singles out the special armor piercing 7N21 and 7N31 9x19mm ammo of being particularly low quality and causing significant reliability problems in the issued PYa pistol. Indeed, the photo of a bullet sticking out of the barrel linked above is a 7N21 round, as seen by the black stepped tip. Other sites have suggested that the PYa only chokes on ammo from certain factories, but this itself can be a seen as representative as an overall lack of ammunition standards in the supply of ammunition to the Russian police and military. As one infantry veteran lamented: \u201cThe Russian arms industry makes reliable and simple weapons, but ammo quality just annihilates it.\u201d\n\nCharlie Gao studied political and computer science at Grinnell College and is a frequent commentator on defense and national-security issues.\n\nImage: Reuters"

    "text": "The French weekly financial newspaper La Tribune reported on Friday that a deal between Cairo and France over the sale of 12 Rafale jet fighters to Egypt has been blocked because the US is refusing to export a component of a cruise missile that is part of the plane.\n\nFrench sources quoted in the report asserted that the delay in the deal is due to the shortage of the American component of the scalp missiles and not a funding issue as in the past.\n\nLa Tribune noted that Dassault Aviation and MBDA declined to confirm reports about the Scalp cruise missile, a low observable air-launched cruise missile.\n\nIn response to the report, the Egyptian army\u2019s official spokesperson Tamer El-Refa\u2019ai told Egypt Independent on Sunday that the issue of the missing American component of the Scalp cruise missile is considered as French \u201cinternal affairs.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper added that France has previously approved the export of the Scalp cruise missiles to Egypt, though the US\u2019s refusal to provide the manufacturer with the American component obstructed this step.\n\nThis refusal triggered outrage among Egyptians who are insisting on receiving the Scalp cruise missiles before completing the Rafale deal.\n\nIt explained that the Egyptian outrage will push France to seek alternatives to the American components through resorting to another missiles\u2019 manufacturer away from MBDA, or to open high-level communication with the US administration, saying that such communications may take place during the upcoming visit of the French President Emmanuel Macron to US in April.\n\nThe French newspaper highlighted that there is a conflict between the US and France regarding French weapons\u2019 deals to Middle East countries including Egypt and United Arab of Emirates [UAE], asserting that the US previously refused to sell French components used to manufacture spy satellites to UAE.\n\nIn November 2017, La Tribune said that Egypt is going to sign a military deal with France which will see Egypt buy 12 Rafale fighter aircrafts.\n\nAt the time, the newspaper quoted anonymous sources as saying that the French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian negotiated the deal with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi while attending the World Youth Forum in Sharm El-Sheikh in November 2017.\n\nIn February 2015, France agreed to deliver 24 Rafale fighter jets to Egypt at a cost of \u20ac 5.2 billion.\n\nThe French Rafael manufacturer Dassault Aviation disclosed in March that it would deliver to Egypt eight Rafale fighters this year.\n\nIn December 2016, Egypt ranked first among developing nations that imports arms, according to a US congressional report.\n\nOver the past few years, Egypt has finalized several arms deals with a number of countries including France and Russia."

    "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 An escalating diplomatic crisis between NATO allies Turkey and the United States may risk suspending a $1.5 billion deal between Turkey and Pakistan for the sale of 30 Turkish-made T129 ATAK helicopter gunships.\n\nThe T129 is being produced by Turkish Aerospace Industries under license from the Italian-British company AgustaWestland.\n\n\u201cThe problem is related with the U.S.-made parts for which TAI will need U.S. export licenses in order to materialize the deal,\u201d a Turkish aerospace official said.\n\nThe T129, based on its predecessor A129 Mangusta, is a twin-engine multirole attack helicopter. The T129 is powered by two LHTEC T800-4A turboshaft engines. Each engine can produce 1,014 kilowatts of output power. The T800-4A is an export version of the CTS800 engine. LHTEC is a joint venture between the American firm Honeywell and the British company Rolls-Royce.\n\n\u201cApparently we shall need U.S. export licenses to go ahead with the T129 deal,\u201d a senior procurement official said. \u201cThis is not a technological or financial matter but is purely political at the moment.\u201d\n\nGo face to face with the TAI T129 ATAK helicopter at the Dubai Airshow 2017.\n\nWashington has sanctioned two Turkish ministers, and U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to double tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium exports to his country. Turkey retaliated by sanctioning two U.S. secretaries, but the row has already sparked a financial crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira has lost 81.5 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in the year to Aug. 12.\n\nThe row significantly deepened after a Turkish court refused to release a U.S. pastor who had been in jail since 2016 on charges of terrorism and attempted to topple Turkey\u2019s elected government. Pastor Andrew Craig Brunson was later released from jail to house arrest, but U.S. officials are demanding his immediate release and return to his homeland.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe two NATO allies also have been at odds over U.S. support for Kurdish militants fighting the Islamic State group in northern Syria, as well as Turkey\u2019s refusal to follow U.S. sanctions on Iran, and Ankara\u2019s decision to deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense systems on Turkish soil.\n\n\u201cThis is a commercial deal (with Pakistan) with a country that has friendly relations with America. For Washington what matters should be the recipient of the systems, not who produces it and if relations are bumpy with the producer country,\u201d a Turkish defense official said. \u201cWhy should the Americans punish Pakistan for their disagreements with Turkey?\u201d\n\nA TAI official said a U.S. embargo on the chopper deal was unlikely because it would also hurt a U.S. company as well as two British companies and one Italian. \u201cThese are not enemy producers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are on the ally side. And we (TAI) are not being sanctioned by the U.S. or any other ally country.\u201d\n\nA U.S. diplomat in Ankara refused to comment.\n\nTurkey and Pakistan signed a deal July 13 for 30 T129 ATAK helicopter gunships. Pakistani officials say their own AH-1F Cobra gunships lack the capability to perform adequately over the higher altitudes of the Hindu Kush mountain range separating Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2016, Pakistani officials thoroughly tested the T129 and endorsed the deal.\n\nLHTEC\u2019s T129 engine also powers the 12 AH\u22121Z Viper attack helicopters ordered from the U.S. These are yet to be delivered, and such a timescale remains unclear in view of present U.S.-Pakistani bilateral relations.\n\nTo finance one of the country\u2019s largest defense and aerospace export contracts, Turkey offered Pakistan a $1.5 billion credit line in 2017, but the deal\u2019s payment terms are unknown.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is not always predictable. \u2026 He may wish to punish Turkey by sabotaging such a critical export contract at a time when the Turkish economy is badly ailing. At the same time he may also wish to give a message to the Pakistanis,\u201d according to a European defense attache in Ankara."

New Puma IFV\u2019s are going to be fitted with the Spike-LR missiles no sooner than in 2018.\n\nAccording to the information obtained by Defence24.pl from the spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defence, the Bundeswehr has acquired a \u201ccertain number\u201d of the MELLS anti-tank missiles (local derivative of the Spike-LR system). The purchases are being still realized. Ultimately, MELLS system is going to replace the Milan ATGW system which is classified as a second generation missile.\n\nAt the moment, the Bundeswehr is receiving MELLS launchers in their portable variant. This type of weaponry is also going to be integrated with the Puma IFV, vehicle which has recently been introduced into service in the German Army. Implementation of this system on the German IFV is planned to happen no sooner than in 2018.\n\nMELLS system uses the Spike-LR Dual missiles which feature a guidance system based on fiber-optics and visible- and thermal-spectrum cameras (similarly as the missiles used by the Polish Army). The missile is capable of destroying armoured targets, including main battle tanks, at distances of up to 4000 meters.\n\nThe contract covering the delivery of the first batch of the Spike missiles for the Bundeswehr has been signed back in 2009 by the Eurospike GmbH joint venture company, with involvement of Diehl BGT Defence (40%), Rheinmetall Defence Electronics (40%) and Rafael. Integration with the Puma IFV is delayed, comparing the current status of the acquisition process with the initial plans.\n\nMilan Missile Launcher on the Marder IFV; Image Credit: Heer/Dana Kazda.\n\nSpike missiles are going to replace the cable-guided Milan 2 ATGW, characterized with a range of 2 kilometres. The Milan missile is capable of penetrating up to 700 mm of armour. Use of this type of missiles requires the operator to observe the target continuously, after firing. The said missiles are also not capable of striking targets that are located behind the obstacles. Milan missiles constitute \u2013 among other weapons \u2013 armament of the Marder IFV\u2019s. The Marder vehicles are going to be replaced by the new Puma IFV. Currently, Milan missiles are also utilized by the German elements of the NATO \u201cSpearhead\u201d unit. This weapon system is also being delivered for the forces of the Iraqi Kurdistan, who are fighting against the IS.\n\nSpike missiles, on the other hand, are widely utilized by the NATO armed forces, including the Polish Army. Poland uses the Spike-LR Dual derivative which is similar to the missile delivered for the Germans. Polish missiles are license manufactured by the ZM Mesko plant. Currently, the Polish Army uses the portable launchers system. Spike missiles are also going to be integrated with the unmanned turrets for the Rosomak APC. In the future they may be used by the prospective Borsuk IFV, based on a track-chassis. Back in January, col. Jacek So\u0144ta, spokesman for the Polish Ministry of Defence, informed Defence24.com that Poland is also willing to integrate the Rosomaks using the Hitfist Turrets, with the Spike system.\n\nREAD MORE: Spike Missiles For Rosomak IFV."

    "text": "The Algerian Navy will soon receive a fifth Kilo class submarine from Russia, as the vessel was completed in St Petersburg earlier this month.\n\nAccording to Menadefense, the Kilo class submarine Akram Pasha and the tug El Moussanid (703) left Oran, Algeria, along with the tug El Moussanid (703) for St Petersburg, where they were spotted on 12 April. It is believed they will be escorting the new submarine on its homeward voyage to Algeria.\n\nAnother Kilo class submarine will apparently join the Algerian Navy fleet in mid-2018 as part of a 2013 order for two new Project 636 Varshavyanka (Kilo class) vessels. It is almost complete and will soon begin sea trials.\n\nThe new submarines will add to four already in Algeria\u2019s fleet \u2013 in June 2006 Rosoboronexport signed a contract with the Algerian Navy for the construction of two Project 636 Improved Kilo class submarines under a roughly US$400-600 million contract. Construction of the first submarine started in 2006 and the second began in 2007. They were handed over to the Algerian Navy in March and September 2010 where they joined two Project 877EKM Kilo diesel electric submarines, which Algeria received in 1987-1988. The latter two were upgraded by Russian shipyards.\n\nThe Project 636 Varshavyanka (Kilo) class is mainly intended for anti-shipping and anti-submarine operations in relatively shallow waters. The tear-drop hulled submarine is 72.6m long, 9.9m wide and can dive to 300 meters. The design has a displacement of 3 076 tons. Underwater, it reportedly has a speed of up to 25 knots. The complement is 52 and the submarine has an endurance of 45 days.\n\nThe boat is fitted with six 533 mm torpedo tubes and carries up to 18 homing or wire-guided torpedoes, or 24 AM-1 mines. The type can also be fitted with four Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nThe outer hull is covered with sound damping tiles and its machinery as well as design is regarded as very quiet. Designed by the Rubin Central Maritime Design Bureau of St Petersburg, the submarine entered service in 1982. The type was originally built at the Komsomolsk shipyard and lately by the Admiralty Shipyard in St Petersburg. It is in service with the navies of Russia, China, Vietnam, Iran, India and Poland, among others. Some 50 have been built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria has apparently also ordered two additional Kilo 877EKM vessels, for delivery in 2020-2022."

If two additional ship options are exercised, the total deal could approach $2B.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy, through an Integrated Program Office (IPO), awarded VT Halter Marine Inc., of Pascagoula, Mississippi, a fixed price incentive (firm) contract for the Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) of the Coast Guard\u2019s lead Polar Security Cutter (PSC).\n\nThe initial award is valued at $745.9 million and supports non-recurring engineering and detail design of the PSC class as well as procurement of long lead-time materials and construction of the first ship. The contract also includes options for the construction of two additional PSCs. If all options are exercised, the total contract value is $1.9 billion.\n\nWhen interviewed by Maritime Reporter & Engineering News in the autumn of 2018, newly minted USCG Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz emphasized the importance of this shipbuilding program. \"My philosophy \u2013 my strategy \u2013 is talk about a 6/3/1. We need a minimum of six icebreakers \u2013 that\u2019s consistent with my predecessors \u2013 that\u2019s based on the high latitude study. Within that 6/3/1, a minimum of three heavy, or Polar Security Cutters, and then the one is we need one now. If we don\u2019t start awarding a contract soon, I\u2019m not so sure we can bridge the life span of the Polar Star much beyond a handful of years. The nation really needs to pay attention up there, and the Coast Guard\u2019s the right agency on that.\"\n\nCoast Guard Commandant Karl Schultz tours the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star while in maintenance and repair at a dry dock facility in Vallejo, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018. The Seattle-based Polar Star is the Coast Guard\u2019s only remaining operational heavy icebreaker.

Schultz, Commandant of the Coast Guard. \u201cWith the strong support of both the Trump Administration and the United States Congress, this contract award marks an important step towards building the nation's full complement of six polar icebreakers to meet the unique mission demands that have emerged from increased commerce, tourism, research, and international activities in the Arctic and Antarctic.\u201d\n\nThe acquisition of Polar Security Cutters is being jointly managed across the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard through an IPO that leverages the expertise and utilizes best practices across each enterprise to deliver a fleet of highly capable, multi-mission ships in the most cost-efficient and timely manner possible. NAVSEA is the lead contracting authority.\n\n\"This contract award reflects the great benefit achieved by integrating the incredible talents of U.S. Coast Guard and Navy acquisition and shipbuilding professionals to deliver best value at speed,\" said James Geurts, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition. \"Working with our industry partners, the team identified approximately $300 million in cost avoidances and accelerated the schedule for delivery of this capability to the nation by almost three years. This reflects the urgency in which we are operating to ensure we deliver capabilities necessary to support the U.S. Coast Guard and the nation\u2019s missions in the polar regions.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the first PSC is planned to begin in 2021 with delivery planned for 2024; however, the contract includes financial incentives for earlier delivery.\n\n\n\n"

Dennis Luyt, Commander, RNLAF. \"We want to be among the best air forces of the world, and the platform of F-35 allows us to do that.\"\n\nVarious distinguished government, military and industry guests joined Luyt in attendance at the ceremony including Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO Marillyn Hewson; State Secretary, the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs Mona Keijzer; and Special Envoy F-35, the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs Maxime Verhagen.\n\n\"From the very beginning of the F-35 program, the Netherlands has been a key partner in developing, testing, improving, and maintaining this remarkable aircraft,\" said Hewson. \"Dutch suppliers have provided high-volume production, structural-design support, and advanced technologies, and Dutch aircraft and personnel continue to support ongoing testing and operations for the worldwide F-35 fleet. As we look to the future, the Netherlands will serve as a sustainment hub in the European region for maintenance, repair, overhaul, and upgrade projects.\"\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the aircraft is scheduled to ferry to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where F-35A pilot training takes place. The aircraft is the first operational F-35 and the third Netherlands jet delivered to date. The first two Dutch F-35s were delivered in 2013 and are at Edwards AFB, California, supporting operational testing. The RNLAF plans to acquire 37 F-35As.\n\nF-35 Program Economic Impact in the Netherlands\n\nDutch industry, including 25 suppliers to date, have benefitted from the F-35 program with contracts awarded for high technology work. As estimated by the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, the F-35 program has already generated more than $1 billion USD in contracts for Netherlands industry, creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs for the Netherlands over the life of the program.\n\nTo date, more than 360 F-35s have been delivered and are now operating from 16 bases worldwide. Ten nations are flying the F-35, seven countries have F-35s operating from a base on their home soil, five services have declared Initial Operating Capability, and two services have announced their F-35s have been used in combat operations.\n\nWith stealth technology, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, weapons capacity and increased range, the F-35 is the most advanced, survivable and connected aircraft in the world. More than a fighter jet, the F-35's ability to collect, analyze and share data, is a powerful force multiplier that enhances all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battlespace enabling men and women in uniform to execute their mission and return home safely.\n\nFor additional information, visit our website: www.f35.com/netherlands .\n\nAbout Lockheed Martin\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 105,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\nSOURCE Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company"

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration, working to increase exports of U.S.-made weapons, has asked the U.S. Congress to review the sale of more than 120,000 precision-guided munitions to allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sources said on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. Capitol building is seen in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2018. REUTERS/ Leah Millis\n\nPresident Donald Trump has thrown his political weight behind the arms export push to help job growth at home. Last year, his administration approved the sale of about $7 billion of the precision-guided weapons to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat deal raised concerns from some members of Congress over American weapons being used in the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen and the deaths of thousands of civilians there since March 2015.\n\nThe value of the transactions under review now could not immediately be determined.\n\nRaytheon Co is the largest maker of the PGMs in the United States. A company official declined comment.\n\nAdministration and congressional sources confirmed that the informal 40-day review period to sell the munitions to the two countries was under way.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees have been briefed, and lawmakers have asked the administration for more information, which one congressional aide said had not yet been provided.\n\nCommittee spokespeople declined comment.\n\nSaudi and UAE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress.\n\nThe issue is likely to come up this week when Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, testifies before the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs panels for the first time since the Senate confirmed the former CIA director in his new position last month.\n\nTrump views weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States and has announced billions of dollars in arms sales since taking office in January 2017.\n\nHe has at times taken a personal role in pushing through foreign sales of U.S. arms, underscoring his determination to make the United States, already dominant in the global weapons trade, an even bigger arms merchant to the world, despite concerns from human rights and arms control advocates.\n\nKey members of Congress, including the leaders of the two committees, are allowed to informally review major foreign arms sales, and at times they have objected to sales and held them up for months.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of Foreign Relations, blocked major sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other Gulf nations for much of last year over a dispute with Qatar, lifting his \u201chold\u201d only early this year.\n\nHowever, if a president wants a sale to go through despite lawmakers\u2019 objections, it can only be stopped if Congress passes legislation blocking the sale. No such measure has ever passed Congress."

The matter was taken up during official level meetings attended by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale and defence secretary in Washington last month, they added.\n\nManufactured by General Atomics, Predator-B has both land and naval versions and can be armed with air-to-land missiles, anti-ship missiles and laser guided bombs.\n\nStand-off capabilities refer to the ability to strike without fear of the defensive capabilities of the target.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon had cleared the sale of 22 Guardian naval surveillance drones to India, New Delhi was insistent that given the costs involved, it was in favour of acquiring an armed drone which operates over both land and sea. \u201cPurchase of the Guardian drone through government to government route did not make sense as even if the unarmed drone identifies a hostile target over Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea, it will have to request for Boeing P- 8I Neptune (aircraft) to destroy the target. The time lag and effort is not worth the while. The Indian need is an armed drone which not only locates but hunts down the target,\u201d said a senior Indian government official who asked not to be identified.\n\nThe other Indian worry is about encryption keys to weaponised drone. Essentially, Indian national security planners are worried whether the US will also have control of the armed drones and could theoretically jam them . e US defence manufacturers have dismissed this concern by saying that India will have all the encryption keys for the armed drone.\n\nThis question, and the issue of the sale of the drones will come up before the technical team of Office of Secretary of Defence (OSD) policy arrives in the Capital on May 3-4, 2018 to discuss the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) with Defence Ministry officials. India needs to sign COMCASA and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for operating highly advanced US defence platforms requiring secured communication and spatial equipment.\n\nThe Indian and US officials said the sale of armed drones could also come up during the two-plus-two dialogue between external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman with newly-appointed US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis in Washington later this month.\n\nWhile Indian national security planners are pleased over the US nod to armed drones, the cost, logistics and maintenance of the UAVs is prohibitive due to separate command and control centres and requirement of round the clock combat vigil."

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Missile-maker MBDA is banking on a new European Union project to help boost wider adoption of its Missile Moyenne Port\u00e9e anti-tank weapon on the continent.\n\nThe confidence by executives stems from last week\u2019s European Council approval of a Beyond-Line-of-Sight Land Battlefield Missile System. The project is one of 34 efforts under the union\u2019s new Permanent Structured Cooperation scheme, or PESCO. The framework is meant to unify military capabilities of the member nations with an eye toward establishing the EU as a military player on the world stage.\n\nThe new missile project offers an glimpse into PESCO\u2019s nascent process for turning political ambitions into actual hardware made by national vendors. Such is the case here, says MBDA, which released a statement saying its MMP anti-tank weapon had been \u201cendorsed\u201d by the EU even though the official, one-paragraph project description makes no mention of a specific weapon.\n\nFrom cyber to military mobility: EU members endorse new defense objectives EU member states adopt 17 new cooperative projects under the fledgling PESCO pact, an initiative meant to sharpen Europe's military edge.\n\nCompany executives told Defense News that the MMP is what defense officials in France \u2014 which has the project lead together with Belgium and Cyprus \u2014 had in mind from the start when offering the project under an EU umbrella.\n\nThe weapon, they argue, is the natural choice because it is already in service with French forces and because it is the sole wholly European option available. (MBDA is a joint venture of Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo.)\n\nA spokeswoman for the French delegation to the EU in Brussels did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe guided MMP, which boasts a range of 4 kilometers, can be fired by dismounted soldiers or from vehicles. Its competitors include the American-made Javelin and variants of the Spike, designed by Israel\u2019s Rafael.

The contract\u2019s signing was confirmed by the Russian side on September 12, 2017 and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan announced at the time that Turkey had already made an advance payment under the contract.\n\nIn mid-June 2018, a source in military and diplomatic circles told TASS that Russian defense enterprises had been assigned the task of completing the production of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems in May 2019 for their delivery to Turkey.\n\nThe S-400 Triumf is the most advanced long-range air defense missile system that went into service in Russia in 2007. It is designed to destroy aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles, including medium-range missiles, and can also be used against ground installations.\n\nThe S-400 can engage targets at a distance of 400 km and at an altitude of up to 30 km."

Based on a T-72 tank chassis with desert camouflage, the Golan-1000 is a self-propelled rocket system that, according to Sputnik International, carries 500mm rounds. The vehicle carries three launchers for the rockets, which are fired from a remote control.\n\n\n\nThe Golan-1000 visually resembles the TOS-1, a multiple rocket launcher based on the T-72 that Russia has supplied to some pro-government forces in Syria. (source: Twitter )\n\nFurther details on the system are not forthcoming, though Sputnik referred to the system as being operated by the Syrian military's 4th Armored Division, which has played a major role in the country's ongoing civil war.\n\nIt is not clear what the system's range is or how many have been produced; it is similarly uncertain if all systems in existence belong to the Syrian military or if some are operated by allied militia groups. The Syrian military is said to have used the Golan-1000 as part of a military offensive against militants in Hajar al-Aswad, an urban area south of Damascus held by an Islamic State cell. The system's name is a reference to the Golan Heights."

    "text": "The federal government's plan to award to a group of companies led by Lockheed Martin Canada the contract to design and support the construction of the navy's new frigates was dealt another setback late Tuesday by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, CBC News has learned.\n\nThe agency said it intends to investigate a complaint by one of the other bidders, Alion Science and Technology Corp., and its subsidiary Alion Canada.\n\nIn a letter obtained by CBC News, the tribunal ordered the Liberal government to hold off on signing a deal with Lockheed Martin, which was selected last month by Public Services and Procurement Canada as the preferred bidder on the $60 billion program.\n\n\"You are hereby ordered to postpone the award of any contract in connection with the above-mentioned procurement until the Canadian International Trade Tribunal determines the validity of the complaint,\" said the letter.\n\nAlion asked the CITT last week to investigate the procurement deal, saying the preferred warship design will need substantial changes and that it doesn't meet the navy's requirements as spelled out in the government tender.\n\nLast week, the company asked the Federal Court in a separate filing for a judicial review of the long-awaited decision.\n\nThree companies were in the running to design the next generation of warships to replace the navy's aging Halifax-class frigates. Navantia, a Spanish-based company, was the other bidder in the competition.\n\nDefence analyst Dave Perry discusses why Ottawa picked Lockheed Martin:\n\nWhy did the government go with Lockheed Martin for warships? Power and Politics 5:45 Defence analyst Dave Perry looks at the reasoning behind the procurement decision. 5:45\n\nAlion proposed its De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn Air Defence and Command (LCF) frigate, a Dutch-designed warship, for the Canadian competition. The ship is already in service in other countries.\n\nNo one from the trade tribunal was immediately available for comment late Tuesday. In a statement early Wednesday, officials at Public Services and Procurement Canada confirmed the federal government had received notice.\n\n\"As this matter is the subject of a complaint which has just been accepted for inquiry by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) and is also the subject of litigation in the Federal Court, comments cannot be provided at this time,\" said department spokesperson Rania Haddad in an email.\n\nProgram already behind schedule\n\nExperts had warned the trade challenge and the court case might delay the program, which is already behind schedule.\n\nThe design competition stretched for almost two years as public services officials and executives at the federal government's go-to shipyard for combat vessel construction, Irving Shipbuilding of Halifax, worked with bidders to ensure a fair competition and to avoid post-decision court fights.\n\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada declined comment when the court challenge was launched last week. But a senior federal official, speaking on background at the time, said the federal government has up to 20 days to respond in Federal Court.\n\nThe official \u2014 who was not authorized to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the file \u2014 said there is flexibility built into the timeline and the government is optimistic it can meet its goal of an early 2019 contract signing.\n\nThe substance of the Alion complaint is that the Lockheed Martin Canada-led bid should have been disqualified from the outset because it allegedly doesn't meet the navy's criteria in terms of speed and crew space.\n\nThe Liberal government said it wanted to go with a proven warship design, rather than starting from scratch, because it would be faster and cheaper."

This is a time we will be encouraging India to look at alternatives.\"\n\nThe upcoming Pompeo's visit to India is said to strengthen strategic bilateral cooperations between both the countries.\n\nEarlier, this month US had pushed India to consider buying its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) and Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) defence missile system in a bid to break the defence deal between India with Russia.\n\nWhile India confirmed that it will be buying the US NASAMS-II systems earlier this month, the Indian Foreign Ministry has expressed that it had no plans of scrapping the $5.43 billion deal inked with Russia in 2018 for five squadrons of the advanced S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems, despite the threat of US imposing sanctions.\n\nCountering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA)\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed into a United States federal law that imposed sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Russia on August 2, 2017. According to the law, the US has the power to impose sanctions on any country that participates in trade or defence deal with any of the three countries.\n\nApart from the Russian arms deal, two Indian oil companies ordered crude oil from Iran in 2018, ignoring the CAATSA sanctions."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate leaders have reached a two-year deal that would set defense spending at $700 billion for 2018 and $716 billion for 2019.\n\nThose top-lines, part of a deal announced by Senate leaders Wednesday afternoon, hews to those authorized by National Defense Authorization Act for 2018 and President Donald Trump\u2019s expected 2019 defense budget.\n\nNot all of the details were announced immediately, as bipartisan talks continued, but sources close to them said spending limits for defense and non-defense combined would be raised by $300 billion over two years.\n\nIt was not immediately clear exactly how the deal will address budget caps and how much of the defense funding will be sought as cap-exempt Overseas Contingency Operations funding.\n\nThe caps, excluding OCO or Department of Energy funding, limit the Defense Department\u2019s base budget to $549 billion for fiscal 2018 and $562 billion for fiscal 2019.\n\nThe emerging deal still may face opposition from House fiscal conservatives over proposed increases to the non-defense side of the budget and from House Democrats who sought a vote on protections for young immigrants.\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a Senate floor speech the agreement would, \u201cunwind the sequestration cuts that have hamstrung the military and jeopardized our national security.\u201d\n\nHouse GOP\u2019s six-week continuing resolution offers military, health care funding The current short-term spending bill expires on Feb. 8. If a new spending plan isn\u2019t adopted by then, lawmakers will trigger another partial closure of government operations.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the emerging deal could be a clean break from the budget dysfunction that has gripped Washington for years.\n\n\u201cAfter months of fiscal brinkmanship, this budget deal is the first real sprout of bipartisanship. and it should break the long cycle of spending crises that have snarled this congress and hampered our middle class,\u201d Schumer said.\n\nThe deal was hailed by defense advocates emerging from a meeting with McConnell on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t have to do as much on non-defense, but this is an absolute necessity, that we\u2019ve got these numbers,\u201d said the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s No. 2 Republican, Sen. Jim Inhofe, of Oklahoma.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel walks toward the Senate chamber W3ednesday. Sen. McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that they have reach agreement on a two-year budget deal. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cTo those who believe sequestration has done a lot of damage to the military, this is the best news I\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, calling the increases \u201csubstantial, much needed.\u201d\n\nGraham said the increase would address readiness, a maintenance backlog and manpower increases, saying \u201cThis is the biggest step toward rebuilding the military I\u2019ve seen since 2011.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an increase for non-defense spending, maybe more than some would like, but I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe FBI could use the money.\u201d\n\nWhether the deal will lift the debt ceiling ahead of a mid-March deadline, had not been finalized, according to the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas.\n\n\n\nLawmakers must still reach an agreement to pass a continuing resolution that averts a shutdown when the last one expires on Thursday.\n\nThe chairmen of the armed services committees, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., voiced support in a joint statement Wednesday. The $700 billion top-line reflects the amount authorized by their panels\u2019 annual defense policy bill."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nThis week, Indian media outlets reported that India and Indonesia are looking to deepen their defense ties following Indian Defense Secretary G. Mohan Kumar\u2019s visit to Jakarta in mid-January.\n\nIndian newspapers cited anonymous defense sources as saying that various moves were agreed to during Kumar\u2019s trip, including expanding military exercises, boosting defense industry collaboration, and deepening maritime cooperation, which includes submarine training for Indonesia.\n\nDespite the usual sensationalism that accompanied the reports, the drive to expand India-Indonesia defense relations is far from new. Defense ties have been a focus as the two large democracies have been advancing their overall ties, which were upgraded to a strategic partnership back in 2005. That brought modest gains in some functional areas, be it disaster management or maritime security or counterterrorism.\n\nMore recently, the attempts to upgrade defense ties have gained even more momentum. Following Indonesian President Joko \u201cJokowi\u201d Widodo\u2019s trip to India last December, both sides committed to strengthening the architecture of their defense relationship by holding regular sessions of their defense ministers dialogue and the joint defense cooperation committee. They also said they would look to upgrade the 2001 Agreement on Cooperative Activities in the Fields of Defense to a more substantive bilateral defense cooperation agreement, indicating that inroads would be made in certain areas.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nIt is little surprise, then, that we are seeing more noise around what the contours of a deeper defense relationship would look like. All the general areas that have been reported \u2013 exercises, training and exchanges, and defense industry cooperation \u2013 are ones that countries would logically consider when expanding any military relationship.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nSome of them also follow in the pattern of what India already has with Indonesia. Maritime security has been a key focus for the leaders of both countries in addition to its clear strategic logic for the two Indian Ocean littoral neighbors, so close observers of the relationship had already expected that to gain steam.\n\nSimilarly, expanding exercises would not be a heavy lift since there are already a range of drills the two sides have, including the army exercise Garuda Shakti which has now undergone four iterations, or, on the navy side, the India-Indonesia Bilateral Maritime Exercise, first held in October 2015.\n\nIn other areas, talking about boosting defense cooperation is also quite apart from acting on it. Take defense industry collaboration, for example. There have already been conversations around potential opportunities, be it technology transfers, purchases of certain maritime equipment, or expanding commercial agreements between shipbuilders or cooperation in military aerospace programs. But it has proven to be a much heavier lift in practice thus far. Seasoned observers know that this gap between rhetoric and reality is true not just of India-Indonesia defense ties, but the relationship more generally as well as ASEAN-India relations as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, some of the comparisons we have seen made between New Delhi\u2019s ties with Indonesia and other Southeast Asian states like Singapore or Vietnam are a bit too much of a stretch. The defense relationship between India and Singapore is much more mature than those with most other ASEAN states, so the complexity of the exercises puts them at a different level, relatively speaking. As for Vietnam, the training aspect of the defense relationship is much further along than it is for Indonesia, despite the fact that there was a deal struck between the two sides back in 2013 for training and support for the Indonesian Air Force\u2019s Sukhoi fighter jets and pilots.\n\nSo while we are likely to see some gains in the India-Indonesia defense relationship in the coming years, one should also keep things in perspective whenever one hears talk of a \u201cdeepening.\u201d"

    "text": "Egyptian TV presenter Amr Adib denounced recent reports by US media which urged cutting the military aid provided by the US administration to Egypt, claiming that it is worth over $40 billion.\n\nLobeLog, a website focusing on US foreign policy in the Middle East released an article published by William Hartung, the director of Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, questioning whether it is a suitable time to rethink US military aid to Egypt, shedding light on the 2018 Egyptian presidential election.\n\n\u201cAt this point the government of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is a democracy in name only. The only genuine candidates against Sisi in [the] election have withdrawn due to intimidation from the regime,\u201d the article said.\n\n\u201cWashington expects Cairo to return the favor for US aid by providing fly-over rights for US aircrafts, expedited access through the Suez canal for the US Navy, counterterrorism cooperation, and maintenance of the peace treaty with Israel. Putting these purported security benefits aside, the underlying issue is that Egypt is not playing the role of staunch ally worthy of over a billion dollars per year in military equipment and training,\u201d the article said.\n\nAdib, however, explained that Egypt is receiving this aid as a part of the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty (Camp David accords) with the auspices of the the United States. The US dedicates a large proportion of economic and military aid for both Egypt and Israel, Israel receives $3 billion annually, while Egypt receives $2.1 billion, made up of $815 million in economic aid and $1.3 billion in military aid.\n\n\u201cThe aid value which is $1 billion is not a big deal in Egypt, as the government adds the same value to subsidize the bread system,\u201d stated Adib.\n\nHe stressed that Egypt can stand strong on its feet without any US aid, and since the time of the regime of former President Gamal Abdel Nasser, nobody has ever twisted Egypt\u2019s arm: \u201cIt is not acceptable that every time something happens in Egypt that may not please the US politicians and institutions, they write articles threatening to uphold their aid,\u201d he said.\n\nAdib said that Egypt does not critically need the aid, as it\u2019s better to pour US investments into the country with bigger funds.\n\n\u201cIf you want to cut the aid, we don\u2019t have a problem with it, but as long it was a part of Camp David accords, the whole agreement will be amended,\u201d Adib said."

It will be supplied by the Gorky Zelenodolsk Shipyard, according to Shepherd Media. The contract is worth $180 million.\n\nRussian defence minister Sergey Shoigu said one of the reasons for Algeria acquiring the Project 22160 was its performance off the Syrian coast.\n\nThe 94 metre long Project 22160 vessels displace 1 300 tons and have a range of 6 000 miles at 30 knots with an endurance of 60 days. Crew is some 80 sailors.\n\nSensors include the Pozitiv-ME1 3D search radar, Pal-N navigation radar and Pallada and Vinyetka-EM sonars and weapons Kalibr-NK cruise missiles as well as a 76.2 mm K-176MA gun or 57 mm AK-220M gun. Apparently, the Algerian version will be armed with Klub-K missiles and Igla surface-to-air missiles. Two rigid-hulled inflatable boats can be carried on each side of the vessel and a helicopter hangar can accommodate a medium sized rotorcraft.\n\nMissions include maritime patrol, exclusive economic zone protection, anti-piracy, counter-terrorism, search and rescue, environmental monitoring and special operations support amongst others.\n\nSix Project 22160 vessels are under construction for Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. The first vessel was laid down in February 2014 and was launched in August 2017 \u2013 it is undergoing sea trials and these included firing Kalibr-NK missiles at targets in Syria from the Caspian Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria is receiving two new Project 636 Kilo class submarines from Russia, with the first about to be delivered and the second nearing sea trials. Algeria has apparently also ordered two additional Kilo 877EKM vessels, for delivery in 2020-2022."

It can engage four targets out to 200 km and altitudes of up to 25 000 metres. The S-300VM is the export version of the S-300 system.\n\nAs a result of the US suspension of some of its $1.3 billion in annual military aid following the ouster of President Mohamed Mursi by the military in July 2013, Egypt has looked to Russia to meet some of its military needs and has agreed to a massive $3.5 billion arms deal, announced at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) 2014 exhibition in Pretoria. State-owned company Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov told RIA Novosti that under the deal Russia would supply small arms, air defence equipment and artillery.\n\nRussia is supplying 46 Ka-52K attack helicopters to Egypt and 50 MiG-29M fighter jets, as well as 1000 AT-9 and 100 AT-16 anti-tank missiles for the Ka-52Ks. Russia also donated a Project-1241/Tarantual fast attack craft to Egypt \u2013 this is armed with Moskit/SS-N-22 anti-ship missiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Russian equipment delivered in the last five years includes 14 Mi-8MT/Mi-17 helicopters and the EgyptSat-2 reconnaissance satellite."

    "text": "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 30) \u2014 The proposed 2019 budget for the Department of National Defense (DND) is \u20b1251 billion, \u20b149 billion higher than their current budget.\n\n\u20b1183 billion was allocated to personnel services \u2014 to increase the compensation for civilian and military personnel, as well as to provide for a pension increase for retirees.\n\n\"'Yun pong increase namin malaki, ito po 'yung dagdag sa second tranche ng ating increases for personal services. Kaya po malaki,\" DND Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said during House Appropriations Committee deliberations Wednesday.\n\n[Translation: Our increase is huge. This is the addition to the second tranche of increases for personal services, and that's why it's huge]\n\nThis \u20b147 billion hike is in line with President Rodrigo Duterte's directive in January to increase the salaries of military and police personnel, one of his campaign promises in 2016.\n\nThe hike comes despite a cut in the budget of other government agencies, such as the Department of Education. Its proposed funds were cut by \u20b151 billion, from over \u20b1580 billion in 2018 to \u20b1528 billion in 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) seeks a 30 percent increase in their 2019 budget, with the bulk of it going to the Philippine National Police.\n\n'Martial law is working'\n\nLawmakers and defense officials also discussed martial law in Mindanao.\n\n\"Martial law is working in Mindanao. Although there are some pockets of trouble there like the groups of Maute, BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters) and Abu Sayyaf in Basilan and Sulu. It is working in other fronts,\" he said.\n\nHe claimed getting good feedback from Mindanao citizens.\n\n\"In fact we get feedback kung pwede raw tuluy-tuloy na [it should not stop],\" he added.\n\nLorenzana had earlier said he is open to further extending military rule in Mindanao, beyond the two extensions Congress granted in 2017.\n\nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief-of-Staff Carlito Galvez wants continuous vigilance in the region, as the ISIS-inspired Maute group responsible for the five-month Marawi City crisis is still actively recruiting members.\n\n\"Nakita po namin talaga na ang ating greatest threat would be the ISIS-Maute group. Considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS talagang evident,\" Galvez said.\n\n[Translation: We saw that our greatest threat is the ISIS-Maute group, considering their connection with Afghanistan and ISIS with Syrian ISIS, it's evident.]\n\nThe AFP Chief also said they can defeat the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) rebels in Mindanao as reflected in the number of surrendering insurgents.\n\n\"We are estimating that in two or three years time, we will defeat the CPP near in the near future,\" he added.\n\nGalvez also affirmed Lorenzana, saying Martial law helps in improving the state of security in the Mindanao.\n\nHe said from January this year, the military was able to neutralize 800 communist rebels, and confiscate 5, 504 high-powered firearms from a number of anti-terrorism operations.\n\nHe added, about 200 members of local terrorist groups have also surrendered"

    "text": "NEW DELHI \u2014 India has signed a $950 million contract with Russia for two upgraded Krivak III-class stealth frigates.\n\nA government-to-government contract was signed between India and United Shipbuilding Corporation of Russia last week for the supply of two stealth frigates after two years of negotiations, an Indian Ministry of Defence official said.\n\nThe deal comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited India on Oct. 5 and the ruling National Democratic Alliance government cut a $5.43 billion deal to buy five Russian S-400 Triumf missile systems despite objections from its ally the United States.\n\nThe MoD official said the procurement of the frigates will involve a rupee-rouble transaction instead of using U.S. dollars to avoid American sanctions on Russian defense companies under CAATSA, or the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.\n\nThe frigates are built by Yantar Shipyard of Russia and will be powered by Ukrainian gas turbine engines. They will be equipped with Indian-built radar, sonar, communication suites and anti-ship BrahMos missile systems, an Indian Navy official said. The ships are expected to be delivered by the end of 2022, the official added.\n\nIndia and Russia signed an agreement in October 2016 for the purchase and construction of four additional upgraded Kravak III-class stealth frigates, under which two frigates will be directly supplied by Russia and two others built at state-owned Goa Shipyard Limited in India though a technology transfer.\n\nA separate contract will be signed next year for the construction of two similar stealth frigates in India.\n\nThe 4,000-ton Krivak III vessels will also accommodate two multirole helicopters and will be used for anti-submarine and airborne early warning missions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

(Airbus)\n\nKey Points\n\nAirbus sees opportunities to meet regional air-surveillance requirements\n\nThe company is exploring industrial partnerships to support its sales drive\n\nAirbus is promoting its C295 maritime surveillance aircraft (MSA) to the Royal Thai Navy (RTN) in the first part of a regional tour in which the company aims to promote the platform's intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) capabilities to Asian military operators.The C295 MSA arrived in Thailand on 3 July, and is being displayed at the RTN's U-Tapao Air Base in Chonburi before similar promotional visits to Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and South Korea \u2013 all countries with stated maritime patrol requirements. Subsequently, Airbus will promote the aircraft to North American operators.\"During its tour, the C295 will demonstrate its advanced ISR capabilities as well as the platform's versatility and suitability for potential operators, especially in the Asian region,\" Airbus said. The company is also promoting the aircraft to meet regional requirements to enhance surveillance, search and rescue, transport, medical evacuation, and humanitarian missions.Airbus said the aircraft on display in Thailand is a model of the platform recently delivered to the Brazilian Air Force to meet its search and rescue and maritime patrol requirements.Airbus said it sees opportunities to supply the aircraft to the RTN, which is expected in the coming years to replace its ageing fleets of Dornier 228 and Fokker F27 Friendship patrol craft, which were acquired from the 1980s onwards.In addition, Airbus said it is seeking to expand sales of the C295 military transport aircraft to the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) took delivery in June 2016 of a single C295W transport aircraft, although it is understood that the service requires three additional platforms."

Major works involved upgrades to the hull, engineering, electrical and weapons systems.\n\nThe Indian Navy said Rear Admiral Superintendent Sandeep Naithani of the dockyard in Mumbai reported that the Guardian has completed all sea trials. It is now due to sail back home to Mauritius.\n\nThe Guardian was donated to the Mauritius Coast Guard by the Indian Navy in 1993. Since then, India has supplied the spares to keep the vessel afloat.\n\nThe boat underwent its first refit carried out by the Indian Navy in 2006. Since then, Mauritius has received two serviceable 3670 HP MTU main engines from Indian to mitigate mechanical problems arising from the ageing of the Guardian.\n\nIn Mauritius, the CGS Guardian primarily works on search and rescue missions as well as surveillance operations over the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). India and Mauritius have a long-standing defence and security relationships that includes Indian training, arming and logistical equipment of the security forces.\n\nIndia is strengthening the naval capabilities of Mauritius and after an official visit by Indian President Ramnath Kovind to Mauritius on 12 March, it was announced that India would provide the island state with an extra $100 million credit line toward military capability-building, as part of the Indian Ocean Region Outreach, which focuses on maritime security, amongst others.\n\nUnder this deal Mauritius will use the money to acquire another offshore patrol vessel from India. This is an extension of a previous $46 million credit line granted in 2014, which had funded the Mauritius Coast Guard\u2019s procurement of 10 fast interceptor boats (FIBs) and two fast attack craft from state-owned Indian shipbuilder Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense and naval cooperation is central in the Indian-Mauritian partnership. India is a critical supporter of the Mauritian security forces and coast guard. Not only does it play a central role in Mauritian capability-building \u2013 in 2015 it donated an offshore patrol vessel, the Barracuda, and provided it with two surveillance aircraft in 2012 \u2013 it\u2019s also directly involved in Mauritian defence: it provides military training to Mauritian forces, patrol services in Mauritian waters , and takes part in the command of Mauritian forces."

    "text": "Serbian P-12 (NATO designation: Spoon Rest)\n\nA-band early warning radar seen at Batajnica airfield on April 26th, 2007 (photo: Slobodan Mihajlovi\u0107) 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade On April 26th, on the territory of military airfield Batajnica, some 20 km north-west of Belgrade, Serbian Ministry of Defence organized a ceremony to mark what was officially described as \"establishing\" of already 45-years old 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade (250. raketna brigada protivvazduhoplovne odbrane, 250.rbr PVO). In fact, the ceremony marked integration into the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade of all Serbian Army units equipped with medium-level air defence rocket systems and expanding that unit task from the defence of capital Belgrade to defence of the entire territory of the Republic of Serbia. Under the new organization, the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade of the Air Force and Air Defence Force (Vazduhoplovstvo i Protivvazduhoplovna Odbrana - V i PVO) of the Serbian Army (Vojska Srbije) is made up of five rocket battalions - two of them armed with S-125M Neva-M (NATO designation: SA-3 Goa) and three armed with 2K12M Kub-M (NATO designation: SA-6 Gainful) rocket systems. In line with its new task, the defence of the entire Serbian sky, the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade will keep its subordinated units deployed all over the country, with two Neva-M battalions deployed around Belgrade, and three Kub-M battalions deployed near the towns of Ni\u0161, Novi Sad and Kragujevac. The recent integration of all Serbian Army Kub-M systems within the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade marked the end of the existence of other three Serbian air defence units: the 230th Self-Propelled Air Defence Missile Regiment (230. samohodni raketni puk protivvazduhoplovne odbrane, 230. srp PVO) based in the town of Ni\u0161, the 240th Self-Propelled Air Defence Missile Regiment (240. srp PVO) based in the town of Novi Sad and the 310th Self-Propelled Air Defence Missile Regimen (310. srp PVO) based in the town of Kragujevac. Previously, in 2004, Serbian-Montenegrin Armed Forces disbanded another Kub-M unit - the 60th Self-Propelled Air Defence Missile Regiment (60. srp PVO) based in the town of Danilovgrad and responsible for the defence of Montenegrin capital Podgorica. The 60th Self-Propelled Air Defence Missile Regiment was created in Zadar, Croatia, on October 8th, 1975, and remained on the territory of that republic until 1992 when following Croatian declaration for independence from the rest of Yugoslavia has been transferred to neighboring Montenegro. The unit remained active in Montenegro until the end of 2004 when it was disbanded and its equipment and personnel transferred to Serbia.\n\nHistory The 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade history goes back to November 25th, 1962, when 250th Air Defence Missile Regiment (250. raketni puk PVO, 250. rp PVO) has been established in Belgrade with single task to defend that city, at that time capital of Communist-controlled Yugoslavia. Between 1962 and 1980, the 250th Air Defence Missile Regiment was armed with S-75 Dvina (NATO designation: SA-2 Guideline) high-level air defence system and its structure was composed of four rocket and one rocket-technical battalions. The 250th Air Defence Missile Regiment changed its name into 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade in 1980 as a result of its expansion with four rocket and one rocket-technical battalions of the S-125M Neva-M (SA-3 Goa) medium-level air defence system. The next evolution in the structure of the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade took place in 1992 when that unit acquired in its structure the 350th Air Defence Missile Regiment (350. raketni puk PVO, 350. rp PVO) that being armed with S-125M Neva-M has been pulled off from Slovenia following that country declaration for independence from the rest of Yugoslavia. This change has finally initiated the long-waited retirement of Dvina rocket system from the structure of the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade. That way, by the time Yugoslavia came under NATO attack named \"Operation Allied Force\" in 1999, the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade was armed only with Neva-M medium-level air defence system. During the war of 1999, the unit managed to down two USAF jet planes, a stealth F-117A Night Hawk and an F-16CJ Fighting Falcon, as well as a dozen of cruise missiles. However, the US-led coalition strike back as a result of what nine members of the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade have lay down their lives for the defense of Belgrade. The last significant moment in the history of the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade took place in October 2004 when Neva-M armed 450th Air Defence Missile Regiment (450. raketni puk PVO, 450. rp PVO) ceased to exist after it was previously transferred from the town of Kraljevo (where it was deployed for 12 years after being pulled off from Macedonia in 1992) in the Belgrade area were it was integrated in the structure of the 250th Air Defence Missile Brigade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReorganization As part of the ongoing reorganization process compiled in line with Serbia's first Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and other related doctrines, the Air Force and Air Defence Force is scheduled to completely change its structure by the end of 2007. Under the new structure, the Air Force will completely adopt air base structure and will continue operating from three strategically located airfields in Serbia, those being: Batajnica, near Belgrade; Ladjevci, near the town of Kraljevo; and Constantine the Great Airport, located in the town of Ni\u0161. The first step toward the establishing of modern model of organization of the Air Force has been made on November 15th, 2006, when 204th Air Base (204. avijacijska baza, 204. ab) was established at Batajnica. The new unit has been created by merging a number of air force, air defence force, as well as technical and logistical support units already based at Batajnica. By June 2007 another new unit, designated 98. Air Base (98. avijacijska baza, 98. ab) will also be formed in Ladjevci. However, unlike at Batajnica, the 98. Air Base will put under its command not only units deployed at Ladjevci but also those that will remain based at Ni\u0161 airfield.\n\nFinally, as part of the ongoing reorganization of Serbian Air Defence Force the 126th Air Reconnaissance Monitoring and Guidance Brigade (126. brigada VOJIN) will soon change its name into 126th Air Reconnaissance Monitoring and Guidance Center (126. center VOJIN). The 126th Air Reconnaissance Monitoring and Guidance Brigade is currently equipped with tube technology, transistor technology as well as first-generation integrated technology radar systems. According to Serbia's first Strategic Defence Review the basic radars in use with the 126th Air Reconnaissance Monitoring and Guidance Brigade are P-12, P-14, P-15, P-18, P-40, RL-128, PRV-11, PRV-16/9, S600, AN/TPS-63, AN/TPS-70 and M85 \u017dirafa.\n\nIgor Bo\u017einovski\n\n"

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 France unveiled Thursday a draft of its 2019-2025 military budget plan, setting \u20ac295 billion (U.S. $361 billion) on spending, which included better barracks, larger orders of Army armored vehicles, and studies on next-generation nuclear submarines and airborne nuclear missiles.\n\nThat spending plan compares to \u20ac190 billion in the present 2014-2018 budget law. The Armed Forces Ministry sees the budget law as a \u201crenewal,\u201d as the government seeks to \u201cregenerate\u201d the services. A first phase consists of \u20ac198 billion in the present five-year government term, with defense spending rising \u20ac1.7 billion each year to hit \u20ac44 billion in 2023. That compares to the 2018 budget of \u20ac34.2 billion.\n\nThat expenditure is covered by the government spending cap, which seeks to rein in the French deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product, as requested by the European Commission. France has pledged to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense by 2025, a target set by NATO for member states.\n\nFrance would reach NATO budget target under top military officer's plan The funding proposed by Army Gen. Pierre de Villiers would help France reach NATO's budget target of 2 percent of GDP by 2022.\n\nThe second phase for 2024 and 2025 assumes an annual \u20ac3 billion increase, with much depending on the macro-economic performance. A government review will be held in 2021 to decide what to commit in the following budgets. A general election will be held in 2023, so the next administration will decide how closely it follows the budget law.\n\n\u201cThere is much pragmatism,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Lureau of consultancy EuroFLconsult and former head of the French defense procurement office. The budget reflected the Army\u2019s leading role in the Barkhane mission in Africa and the need for an overhaul of aircraft maintenance.\n\n\u201cService is very expensive,\u201d he added.\n\nThe budget law drew criticism from Fran\u00e7ois Cornut-Gentille, a member of parliament on the finance committee of the lower house National Assembly.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThe main effort is pushed back after the five-year term, whether it is budgetary outlay, increase in personnel or delivery of equipment,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nTwo further setbacks were the Armed Forces Ministry carrying the full cost of overseas deployment and the lack of spending adjustment for inflation.\n\nThe Army and nuclear deterrent were seen as major beneficiaries of the budget.\n\nSpending on buildings and infrastructure for the services will rise 14 percent, seeking to remedy the poor conditions of the bases and family housing. Some 6,000 personnel will be recruited, reversing a previous policy of cutting the size of services. Some 750 staff will be recruited to support arms exports.\n\nThe Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement procurement office had already been authorized to recruit 80 staff for 2017-18 to support export deals, following a request that stemmed from the sharp rise in foreign arm sales.\n\nOn equipment orders, the Army\u2019s Scorpion modernization program will see a faster delivery, with half the fleet of Jaguar troop carriers, Griffon combat vehicles and Light VBMR vehicles delivered by 2025.\n\n\u201cThat is very good news,\u201d a defense executive said. \u201cThere was a sanctuary for Scorpion.\u201d\n\nOther notable investments:\n\nThe Navy will receive the first four Barracuda nuclear-powered attack submarines, last three Fremm multimission frigates and first two FTI intermediate frigates.\n\nThere will be studies on arming the air defense version of the Fremm with the Aster Block 1 NT missile.\n\n\n\nThe Air Force will receive six armed Reaper drones, the first European medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV, 28 Rafale fighter jets and 55 upgraded Mirage 2000D fighters.\n\n\n\nAcquisition of the A330 MRTT tanker transport aircraft will be increased to 15 from 12, with the first 12 delivered by 2023 and the remaining three shipped by 2025.\n\n\n\nAn annual \u20ac1.8 billion will be spent on concept studies on future weapons, including fighter jet, heavy tank and replacement to the nuclear-powered Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier.\n\n\n\nThe annual budget for feasibility studies will rise to \u20ac1 billion from \u20ac730 million.\n\n\n\nA total \u20ac112.5 billion will be spent on equipment in 2019-23, of which \u20ac25 billion earmarked for studies on the next-generation nuclear submarine and airborne nuclear missile. Orders for the H160 for the joint light helicopter were pushed back to 2022, with delivery in 2028 in the next multi-year budget law.\n\nFor intelligence gathering, there will be orders for six light ISR aircraft, and Musis and Ceres satellites to gather visual and electronic intelligence. The government will seek a 36 percent increase in the number of programs run in cooperation with European allies.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the U.K. will be considered a European partner once Britain leaves the European Union, a second defense executive said."

    "text": "Author: Abhijit Singh, Observer Research Foundation\n\nAt a recent press conference in New Delhi, India\u2019s Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman surprised reporters by stating that she saw \u2018no tension between the navies of India and China in the Indian Ocean\u2019. In response to a question about a perceived \u2018tussle\u2019 for supremacy in the Indian Ocean, Sitharaman downplayed the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) threat in India\u2019s near-seas, choosing curiously not to elaborate on the matter.\n\nNot everyone in India\u2019s security circles would agree with the Minister\u2019s assessment. Over the past few years, China\u2019s rapidly expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean has created anxiety in India\u2019s strategic community, where many believe China\u2019s naval activism has shrunk New Delhi\u2019s space for operational manoeuvre. Not only has China made inroads into India\u2019s traditional sphere of influence in maritime South Asia; Beijing has also leveraged its naval anti-piracy deployments for geopolitical gains by promoting partnerships with regional states and advancing a \u2018benevolent China\u2019 narrative.\n\nMore importantly, Beijing has raised its strategic stakes in the Indian Ocean. It is odd that China\u2019s anti-piracy contingents now comprise guided-missile frigates, advanced destroyers and special operations forces \u2014contingents suited more for high-impact \u2018presence operations\u2019 than anti-piracy missions. Since the inauguration of China\u2019s first overseas military facility in Djibouti, the PLAN\u2019s bid for strategic access in the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical littorals has been amply evident.\n\nFor New Delhi, the bigger challenge has come from Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean. In recent years, Chinese anti-piracy contingents have invariably been accompanied by a PLAN submarine. In the name of counter-piracy operations, Chinese submarines have gathered critical information about the Indian Ocean\u2019s operating environment and have spent an inordinately long time scouring the South Asian seas. The PLAN has been assisted in its endeavours by the Pakistan Navy, raising further concerns in India about an evolving China\u2013Pakistan axis in the Indian Ocean. China\u2019s reported deployment of a submarine in July 2017, at the height of the month-long stand-off between the Indian Army and the People\u2019s Liberation Army in the Doklam plateau, so upset New Delhi that India\u2019s naval leadership felt compelled to order permanent surveillance of the Indian Ocean\u2019s critical sea lanes and choke points by \u2018mission-ready\u2019 warships.\n\nIn its attempts to maintain a favourable balance of naval power in the Indian Ocean, New Delhi has drawn close to Washington and Tokyo. The trilateral India\u2013US\u2013Japan Malabar exercises have grown in scope and complexity with the addition of more combat drills, but New Delhi has been strangely reluctant to expand the tent to accommodate the Royal Australian Navy. It is possible India might consider entering into other trilateral arrangements (possibly with France and Australia) before assenting to a large naval coalition in the Indian Ocean.\n\nTo New Delhi\u2019s credit, it has stepped up its game in the Western Indian Ocean \u2014 the focal point of China\u2019s investment and infrastructure initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region. After signing logistical pacts with Oman and France, India has strengthened maritime ties with Mauritius, Seychelles, Mozambique and Madagascar. A visit by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to East African island states in April 2018 demonstrated New Delhi\u2019s resolve to rise to the challenge posed by China in the Western Indian Ocean littoral.\n\nMeanwhile, there are indications that Beijing may have been less than straightforward about its Belt and Road Initiative. The developmental blueprint is inherently \u2018dual-use\u2019 in character: Chinese-constructed commercial facilities are often structurally upgradable for military use (as witnessed in October 2014 when a PLAN submarine docked at a Chinese-constructed facility in Colombo), and the terms of agreement for port operations are almost always skewed in favour of Chinese state-owned companies.\n\nNew Delhi knows China is being smart with its influence projection in the Indian Ocean. Beijing has ensured that its warships do not threaten Indian interests in the Indian Ocean. PLAN ships have not challenged India\u2019s sovereignty in its territorial waters and have maintained a safe distance from the Andaman and Nicobar islands. China has limited its ventures to its Belt and Road Initiative partner states, who are eager to benefit from Beijing\u2019s economic and military assistance.\n\nYet there is no escaping the sense in New Delhi of a \u2018slow choke\u2019 of Indian equities in the Indian Ocean. In order to manage the India\u2013China rivalry at sea, some analysts have proposed an \u2018incidents at sea\u2019 agreement with objectives similar to the US\u2013USSR \u2018INCSEA\u2019 pact of 1972. While such an arrangement could indeed de-escalate a crisis arising from an accidental encounter at sea, it is not entirely clear how it would help in clarifying suspicions about strategic intent. The Indian Navy would be happy to sign up to a \u2018code of conduct\u2019 if it were to also apply in the Western Pacific, where there is an equal possibility of an India\u2013China skirmish. But that, presumably, will not be acceptable to China.\n\nAs things stand, the Indian Navy is intent on emphasising its pre-eminent status in the Indian Ocean. Even so, the task of constantly patrolling the South Asian seas is imposing a heavy burden on naval frontline assets. The sheer magnitude of the task has led Admiral Sunil Lanba, head of the Indian Navy, to observe that even though Indian warships were monitoring the pattern and periodicity of extra-regional deployments, it is clear the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy is here to stay in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt is possible the Admiral was acknowledging the putative India\u2013China \u2018reset\u2019 in bilateral relations and the attendant need for cooperative engagement with the PLAN. Or maybe he was subtly cautioning his subordinates that they needed to do more to counter the China threat in India\u2019s strategic backyard.\n\nAbhijit Singh is Senior Fellow and Head of the Maritime Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is poised to get congressional authorization to start building a controversial new submarine-launched low-yield nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Senate and House came together Monday on a $716 billion defense authorization report that authorizes $65 million to develop the weapon, aimed at deterring Russia, according to the bicameral compromise conference report.\n\nThe requirement for the weapon \u2014 likely to be a submarine-launched Trident II D5 with a W76-2 warhead \u2014 is part of the administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review.\n\nThe report for the sweeping 2019 National Defense Authorization Act is expected to come to a vote in the House this week and the Senate next week. The annual must-pass bill covers military hardware, personnel and a wide swath of hot-button national security issues.\n\nIn a minor win for opponents of the new weapon, the energy secretary would not be able to reprogram money to begin a nuclear weapons program or begin a new phase of a nuclear weapons program.\n\nLow-yield nuclear weapons per 2004 law need special authorization from Congress, but the new legislation would make them equivalent to other nuclear weapons, with the same authorization requirements. That\u2019s a win for W76-2 advocates.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest move in a mostly partisan battle that saw the Senate Appropriations Committee approve a Pentagon spending bill with language to order more study before the weapon can be developed. The fate of the larger bill was unclear as of Tuesday.\n\nCongressional Republicans and the Pentagon are advocating for the systems to deter Russia from using its own arsenal of low-yield nuclear weapons. Still, many Democrats and nonproliferation advocates see it as lowering the threshold for a nuclear war.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nMore broadly, the compromise conference report includes a sense of Congress that expresses support for the administration\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review \u2014 and meets the president\u2019s budget with $142.2 million for the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s nuclear weapons activities and defense nuclear nonproliferation program, according to a House Republican summary.\n\nThe bill would also increase authorized funding to accelerate two key Air Force nuclear modernization programs: the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and the Long Range Standoff cruise missile.\n\nNote: An earlier version of this story partially misstated the legislation\u2019s impact on congressional oversight of a low-yield nuclear weapon."

Russia reduced its military spending last year for the first time since 1998, it said.\n\nSOCHI, May 3. /TASS/. The figures in the report of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Russia\u2019s military spending in 2017 are inaccurate, although the tendency of the falling spending is right, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n\"The figures do not really correspond to reality, but the tendency is right,\" Peskov said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin earlier noted that a large-scale effort in the Russian army on technical and technological renovation had been carried out. This process was completed and therefore the peak of military spending on armaments was over, Peskov noted.\n\n\"So, there is a tendency of a small step-by-step decrease in spending,\" Peskov said. He stressed that the Russian military and industrial sector is working in full and high-tech developments are made."

Austal is still in contract negotiations with the GoRTT but has concluded an interim Schedule Protection Agreement to allow work to commence at Austal\u2019s Henderson, Western Australia centre for excellence in Maritime design to support the sale. A fee is due to be paid which will allow Austal to commence some work on the project and to order long lead time items.\n\nIt is expected that the final contract will not be announced until late in quarter 1 of the 2019 calendar year. The order is likely to be valued at circa AU$100m plus a multi-year ongoing maintenance and support package. Austal also expects to establish a Service Centre in Trinidad to support these vessels, the Austal supplied Fast Patrol Craft, and any additional vessels requiring maintenance as determined by GORTT.\n\nThe new vessels will enhance the border protection capabilities of the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard (TTCG) in conjunction with its existing fleet, and will join six Austal Fast Patrol Craft acquired in 2009.\n\nThe new Cape Class vessels will be built in Austal\u2019s Henderson shipyard based in Western Australia. Austal have already built 10 Cape Class vessels in Henderson for the Australian Border Force and RAN. Delivery is expected to be in mid-2020.\n\nDesigned and built by Austal, the Cape Class is a 58 metre all aluminium monohull patrol boat specifically produced to combat the full range of maritime security threats. The vessel has a long 4000 nautical mile range and 28-day patrol cycle with a crew of up to 22. The vessel also supports two high speed 7.3 metre Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats used for intercepting other vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They are 35 metres long and have a maximum speed of 30 knots. They will be fitted with two 12.7 mm machineguns and a 20 mm cannon and a 4.7 metre long Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The weapons will be added in Nigeria. Other equipment includes two Furuno radars and a Vigy Observer electro-optical system.\n\nNigeria\u2019s FPB 110s are based on the models produced for Kuwait, but are driven by propellers and not water jets. They are apparently also more comfortable for the crew, with improved accommodation. The two vessels, Nguru and Ekulu, can accommodate 17 people, including a dozen crew members.\n\nThe boats are powered by two MTU 16V2000 diesel engines giving a top speed of 30 knots and a range of 900 miles with 3-5 day endurance.\n\nOnce delivered, they will be used to improve maritime security off Nigeria, with an emphasis on piracy and maritime crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcea has delivered a number of other vessels to Nigeria, including three 24 metre long FPB 72s in 2012 and a 32 metre FPB 98 Mk II in 2013. Five FPB 72s have been ordered, with two, the Gongola and Calabar, delivered to Nigeria in January this year after the Shiroro and Ose arrived in 2017. The final FPB 72 will be delivered along with the two FPB 110s."

It also indicated that Ghana has also agreed to bear the cost and take primary responsibility for securing U.S. military facilities in the country.\n\nAccording to sources, the negotiation started in 2017 but was approved on Thursday, 8 March 2018. This news attracted mixed reactions from a section of the Ghanaian public.

It does not cover the current range and volume of bilateral exercises and assistance.\" This year, the United States of America is investing over $200million in training and equipment for the Ghanaian armed forces. Ghana is also once again preparing to train U.S Forces as it did in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Ghana are planning joint security exercises in 2018 which require access to Ghanaian bases by U.S participants and those from other nations when included. We refer all questions to the government of Ghana.\u201d"

Ted Aljibe, AFP\n\nMANILA - The United States handed over six surveillance drones to its ally the Philippines on Tuesday, as part of efforts to boost its ability to tackle a growing threat from Islamist militants and to respond to natural disasters.\n\nThe six Boeing Insitu ScanEagle drones, which have two cameras and can operate for up to 24 hours on a single run, were financed through a $13.7 million grant from Washington's foreign military assistance program.\n\nIt follows the transfer of two single-engine surveillance planes last year.\n\nThe Philippines plans to deploy the drones for surveillance against militants and pirates, and for surveying the aftermath of disasters like typhoons, mudslides and earthquakes.\n\n\"This acquisition of ScanEagle is one way to modernize the military to deter those who want to wage war against our country,\" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at a ceremony at a Manila air force base, attended by the U.S. ambassador.\n\n\"This collaboration is also an indication of the Philippines and the United States' goodwill, deep friendship and genuine commitment to peace.\"\n\nThe United States is the most important military partner of the Philippines, with a decades-old treaty alliance and numerous pacts that enable rotational deployment of U.S. troops and annual joint exercises.\n\nHowever, ties have been tested by President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility towards the United States.\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. military provided technical support and surveillance vital in helping the Philippines end a five-month occupation of Marawi City by pro-Islamic State rebels last year."

The US State Department has acknowledged that US ambassadors around the world have instructions to talk governments out of cooperation with Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after negotiations with his Slovenian counterpart Karl Erjavec on Wednesday.\n\n\"Just yesterday the US State Department spokesperson proudly said in public that all American ambassadors in all countries of the world without exception have strict instructions: to go and demand every day that certain states do not cooperate with Russia,\" Lavrov said.\n\n\"That\u2019s because the US slapped sanctions on Russia. I think it\u2019s enough to just hear this fact to understand on what principles the Americans build their relations with foreign countries,\" Russia\u2019s top diplomat said.\n\nSpeaking on relations with Slovenia, Lavrov noted that Ljubljana \"seeks to conduct its foreign policy to cooperate with those states that may provide the maximum economic and investment benefits.\" \"Slovenia wants to preserve its cultural and spiritual identity. I don\u2019t see confrontation with anyone here,\" he said. \"We fully respect this multi-faceted approach.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, US Department of State Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters all US diplomatic missions abroad were tasked with talking governments in their respective countries out of business contacts with Russia, most notably in military and defense sector. The US administration believes that its recent law on sanctions helped to thwart Moscow\u2019s deals with various partners worth more than $3 billion in total, she said."

    "text": "Japan\u2019s government has approved a record defence budget, with money earmarked for costly missile defence systems and, controversially, weapons that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korea.\n\n\n\nThe 5.19tn yen ($46bn) budget, up 1.3% from last year, is the largest ever and marks the six straight annual rise in defence spending under Japan\u2019s conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe.\n\nAbe, who ended a decade of defence cuts soon after becoming prime minister in late 2012, has described the threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d.\n\nThe regime has launched two missiles over northern Japan this year, and several others have landed inside its 200 nautical-mile exclusive economic zone. In September, North Korea threatened to \u201csink Japan into the sea\u201d with a nuclear bomb after Tokyo and Washington spearheaded a new round of UN security council sanctions against the regime.\n\nDefence officials say Japan needs to drastically and quickly upgrade its missile defence in response to Pyongyang\u2019s rapid development of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said this month: \u201cAt a time when North Korea is beefing up its ballistic missile capability, we need to strengthen our capability fundamentally.\u201d\n\nThe new budget, which has to be approved by parliament, came days after Japan said it would buy land-based Aegis Ashore missile defence systems from the US to improve its ability to locate and destroy incoming North Korean missiles.\n\nAbout 730m yen ($6.4m) was set aside to prepare for the introduction of the systems, which will be operational by 2023 and are expected to cost at least 200bn yen.\n\nAmid pressure from hawkish members of Abe\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), Japan will also acquire cruise missiles that could be used in pre-emptive strikes against North Korean military sites.\n\nThe budget includes more than 2bn yen for a Norwegian-built cruise missile with a range of 500km that can be fired from F-35 stealth fighter jets. Japan also plans to buy US-made cruise missiles with a range of 900km.\n\nIn addition to the land-based Aegis radar stations, Japan will invest in a new, longer-range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, and upgrades to Patriot missile batteries \u2013 the last line of defence against incoming warheads.\n\nThe heavy spending on US military hardware comes after Donald Trump vowed to boost arms sales by pressuring Japan and South Korea to play a bigger role in their own defence. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan,\u201d Trump said during a visit to Asia last month.\n\nCritics say possession of a first-strike capability violates Japan\u2019s constitution, which bans the use of force to settle international disputes and has restricted the country\u2019s military to a purely defensive role since the end of the second world war.\n\nOnodera and other senior LDP officials say Japan would target North Korean missile sites only if it believed an attack was imminent \u2013 a move they insist would not violate the country\u2019s \u201cpacifist\u201d principles.\n\nBut Yukio Edano, whose Constitutional Democratic party of Japan fought October\u2019s general election vowing to defend Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, said the acquisition of cruise missiles would be a \u201cfairly big point of dispute\u201d when MPs debate the budget next month.\n\nAkira Kato, a professor of international politics and regional security at JF Oberlin University in Tokyo, said the Abe administration was exploiting the North Korean crisis to bolster Japan\u2019s defences. \u201cJapan is expected to continue strengthening its defence power for the time being,\u201d Kato told Agence France-Presse.\n\nWhile the budget\u2019s focus was on North Korea, it included more than 55bn yen for the construction of military facilities on two outlying islands to boost the ability to respond to Chinese activity in the East China Sea.\n\nThe islands are not far from the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands \u2013 uninhabited outcrops that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, whose vessels regularly enter Japanese waters near the territories."

The aircraft has been widely used in anti-terrorist operations, security patrols and aerial detection.\n\n\"The aircraft marks the transformation of China's aviation equipment from manned to unmanned, entering the world's high-end drone market,\" said Tan Ruisong, chairman of AVIC.\n\nThe company on Sunday launched the Wing Loong I-D, the latest member of the UAS family. It said the 30-minute maiden flight was successful. The fuselage of new model is completely built with composite material.\n\nThe Wing Loong UAS series is developed by the Chengdu Aircraft Design and Research Institute under AVIC in southwest China's Sichuan Province."

    "text": "Recent reports have highlighted that India\u2019s planned defence procurement from Russia could potentially come under US sanctions under a newly enacted law, Countering America\u2019s Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).1 The Act, if implemented in its extreme form, has the potential to adversely affect India\u2019s defence purchases from its traditional partner, Russia, besides putting to test India\u2019s growing defence and security relations with the United States. This Brief examines CAATSA and its likely implications for India\u2019s defence and security cooperation with two of its main arms suppliers, Russia and the United States.\n\nUnderstanding CAATSA\n\nCAATSA was passed overwhelmingly by the US Congress and signed reluctantly by President Donald Trump.2 Enacted on August 2, 2017, it aims to counter the aggression by Iran, Russia and North Korea through punitive measures.3 Title II of the Act primarily deals with sanctions on Russian interests such as its oil and gas industry, defence and security sector, and financial institutions, in the backdrop of its military intervention in Ukraine and its alleged meddling in the 2016 US Presidential elections. Section 231 of the Act empowers the US President to impose at least five of the 12 listed sanctions \u2014 enumerated in Section 235 of the Act \u2014 on persons engaged in a \u201csignificant transaction\u201d with Russian defence and intelligence sectors. Two of the most stringent of these sanctions are the export licence restriction by which the US President is authorised to suspend export licences related to munitions, dual-use and nuclear related items; and the ban on American investment in equity/debt of the sanctioned person. Some other sanctions, which are of not much relevance to India, include restriction on US Export Import Bank assistance; prohibition on loans from international financial institutions; exclusion from participation in US government procurement; and visa restrictions on corporate officers of the sanctioned entities.\n\nSubsequent to the enactment of the Act, the US President has delegated his powers to the Secretary of State to implement Section 231 in consultation with the Treasury Secretary. As part of Section 231 of the Act, the Department of State has notified 39 Russian entities, dealings with which could make third parties liable to sanctions. These include almost all of the major Russian companies/entities such as Rosoboronexport, Almaz-Antey, Sukhoi Aviation, Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG, and United Shipbuilding Corporation which are active in manufacturing defence items and/or their exports. The list also includes a few entities from the intelligence sector (Table 1).\n\nIt is important to mention that among the 39 entities, Rosoboronexport, the Russian state-controlled intermediary for export/import of arms, also figures in the list notified on April 6, 2018 by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the Department of Treasury, in pursuance of various Executive Orders, besides CAATSA.4 The significance of Rosoboronexport finding its name in the OFAC\u2019s list is that, apart from all of its assets subject to US jurisdiction being frozen, any non-American person facilitating significant transactions with it will also be liable to face sanctions by the United States.5\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that the mere naming of 39 Russian entities by the US authorities or dealings by any country with these entities does not automatically lead to the imposition of sanctions under the CAATSA provisions. The key determinant for imposing sanctions is \u201csignificant transaction\u201d between the named Russian entity and an outside agency. It is also important to note that the determination of what is a significant transaction is not based purely on the monetary value. As explained by the Public Guidance/Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) issued by the State Department:\n\nThe factors considered in the determination may include, but are not limited to, the significance of the transaction to US national security and foreign policy interests, in particular whether it has a significant adverse impact on such interests; the nature and magnitude of the transactions; and the relation and significance of the transaction to the defence or intelligence sector of the Russian government.6\n\nIt is significant to note that no sanctions have yet been imposed on any country, though US officials claim that they have been quite successful in persuading a few potential buyers from buying Russian arms. In a special briefing on January 30, 2018, senior State Department officials boasted that their global outreach on Section 231 has \u201cturn[ed] off potential deals that equal several billion dollars. And that is real success, it\u2019s real money, and it\u2019s real revenue that is not going to Russia as part of this law.\u201d7 Despite CAATSA having been enacted in August 2017, Rosoboronexport officials noted that, in 2017, the geographical spread of Russian arms export agreements expanded to cover 53 countries, earning the country revenues totalling US$15 billion.8\n\nIndia\u2019s Arms Procurement: Role of Russia and other Major Suppliers\n\nIndia faces one of the most complex security environments in the word that spans the full spectrum of conflict from nuclear to sub-conventional war, and the possibility of a two front war. Apart from cross-border terrorism and growing radicalisation in its immediate and extended neighbourhood, India\u2019s security landscape is challenged by the unresolved border disputes with Pakistan and its \u2018all-weather friend\u2019, China. Between these two traditional rivals, it is China which is increasingly becoming unpredictable for India\u2019s security calculus. China\u2019s increasing military activism under its life-time president, supported by an unpreceded increase in military spending \u2014 which has made it the second largest military spender in the world \u2014 is of particular concern to India. Its military assertion, including recently in Doklam, and growing military encirclement of India through land- and sea-based infrastructure networks in the Indian Ocean Region, pose a grave challenge to India in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn order to meet the myriad security challenges, it has been a constant endeavour of India to strengthen its defence preparedness, by equipping its armed forces with state-of-the-art arms. Towards this end, India has spent a great deal of resources, with the defence budget for 2018-19 amounting to Rs 2,79,305 crore (US$43.4 billion). By virtue of the size of the defence budget, India has a significant arms procurement spend (Rs 74,116 crore or $11.3 billion in 2018-19), which is funded through the allocation for capital expenditure in the defence budget. In 2018-19, the defence capital expenditure amounts to Rs 93,982 crore ($14.3 billion), which represents 34 per cent of the defence budget and 31 per cent of total central government capital expenditure. Much of the procurement budget is, however, spent on importing arms, indicating the deficiency in India\u2019s defence R&D and manufacturing capability. Heavy dependence on foreign arms has earned India the dubious distinction of being one of the largest arms importers in the world. According to the US Congressional Research Service, during the period 2008-2015, India was the second biggest recipient of arms among the developing countries, with deliveries received totalling $26.4 billion.9\n\nWhile importing arms, India has, since independence, followed a policy of diversification, which has led it to source weapons from more than two dozen countries. Nonetheless, the Soviet Union (and later Russia) has been the main source of India\u2019s arms imports since the 1960s when India first signed the MiG-21 fighter deal. Other significant suppliers of arms include the UK, France, Israel and the United States. Among these, the US has, in particular, been quite successful in bagging multi-billion dollar arms contracts in recent years, thanks to the 2005 India-US nuclear deal, in which US defence contractors \u201cplayed a part\u201d in passing a key legislation in the US Congress.10 Between 2013-14 and 2015-16, the US has won 13 contracts worth Rs 28,895 crore ($4.4 billion). Both in term of the number and value of contracts, the US is way ahead of other major suppliers (Table 2). In percentage terms, the US share of Indian arms imports total 23 per cent in terms of the number of contracts and 54 per cent by value.\n\nSince 2008, the US has bagged more than $15 billion in arms deals including for the C-17 Globemaster and C-130J transport planes, P-8 (I) maritime reconnaissance aircraft, M777 light-weight howitzer, Harpoon missiles, and Apache and Chinook helicopters.11 This value is all set to increase further with the US likely accepting an Indian request for Sea Guardian drones. In addition, US defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are also strong contenders for a number of high-profile arms deals, including the recently floated tender notices for 110 fighter planes for the Indian Air Force, 57 Multi-Role Carrier Borne Fighters for the Indian Navy, and 234 naval utility and multi-role helicopters.\n\nThe success of the US, and also Israel to a large extent, in the Indian arms market has its effect on Russian supplies, though Moscow still remains India\u2019s predominant defence supplier. As per the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Arms Transfer Database, during the period 2010-17, Russia was the top arms supplier to India, with total deliveries amounting to 19.8 billion Trend Indicator Values (TIV),12 followed by the US (3.05 billion TIV), and Israel (2.5 billion TIV). In percentage terms, however, the Russian share in India\u2019s arms imports during the same period has declined to 68 per cent, from an all-time high of 74 per cent during the 2000s, whereas the combined share of the US and Israel has increased from nine to 19 per cent. Between 2013 and 2017, Russia\u2019s share declined further to 62 per cent, whereas the combined share of US and Israel increased to 26 per cent.13 Accounting for about 15 per cent, the United States is the second biggest supplier of arms to India during the five year period ending 2017. Between 2000-2009 and 2010-17, US arms deliveries to India have increased by a whopping 1470 per cent. Figures 1 and 2 portray the summary of India\u2019s main arms suppliers and their share since the 1950s.\n\nBehind the curtain of Russian dominance also lies the criticality of India\u2019s defence preparedness and indigenous manufacturing. It is needless to say that the bulk of the potent weapons in India\u2019s arsenal are of Soviet/Russian origin and that some of these are not available for purchase from any other source, even for love of money.\n\nThe nuclear submarine INS Chakra, the Kilo-class conventional submarine, the supersonic Brahmos cruise missile, the MiG 21/27/29 and Su-30 MKI fighters, IL-76/78 transport planes, T-72 and T-90 tanks, Mi-series of helicopters, and Vikramaditya aircraft carrier are all sourced from India\u2019s traditional Cold War partner.\n\nSimilarly, from the point of view of indigenisation and self-reliance efforts, which are being reinvigorated through the present government\u2019s Make in India programme, Russian technologies constitute the mainstay of India\u2019s licence-based manufacturing.\n\nImplication on India\u2019s Arms Procurement from Russia\n\nCAATSA, if implemented in its stringent form, is likely to affect India\u2019s arms procurement from Russia in a number of ways. First, India\u2019s planned procurement from Russia, particularly the S-400 air defence system, Project 1135.6 frigates and Ka226T helicopters, will come under the immediate scanner of US authorities, as they are mandated to deter exports of key Russian defence entities. In all likelihood, US authorities will try to influence their Indian counterparts to ignore the Russian platforms, though it is entirely up to New Delhi to make its own judgement. Second, CAATSA is likely to affect all the joint ventures (JVs) \u2013 existing or planned \u2014 between Indian and Russian defence companies. Some of the existing JVs that may come under the scanner are: Indo Russian Aviation Ltd, Multi-Role Transport Aircraft Ltd and Brahmos Aerospace. Third, the Act will also affect India\u2019s purchase of spare parts, components, raw materials and other assistance for which Indian entities are dependent on Russia for domestic licence manufacturing and maintenance of existing equipment.\n\nCAATSA and India-US Defence Cooperation\n\nCAATSA has the potential to heighten India\u2019s traditional insecurity about the United States as a reliable partner, and sour New Delhi\u2019s defence and security cooperation with Washington at a time when the US is projecting India as a key partner in its Indo-Pacific strategy, with the US National Security Strategy 2017 explicitly supporting New Delhi\u2019s vital role in this regard.14 The biggest question therefore is how and to what extent CAATSA is going to affect India-US defence and security cooperation. It all depends on how lightly or stringently CAATSA provisions are imposed. Apart from the standard waivers that the US President enjoys on the grounds of national security interests, there are plenty of conciliatory remarks from higher American authorities, which indicate that Washington may take a lenient view of CAATSA in regard to India\u2019s defence cooperation with Russia. For instance, Admiral Harry Harris, Commander of the US Pacific Command, referred to a classified letter written by Secretary of Defense James Mattis to the concerned members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, wherein Secretary Mattis has requested for \u201csome relief from CAATSA\u201d for countries like India.15 In his argument, Admiral Harris has also favoured relief citing the \u201cstrategic opportunity\u201d that India presents to the US and also the opportunity \u201cto trade in arms with India.\u201d Other senior US defence department officials have also made similar statements favouring the adoption of a lenient view for India\u2019s defence procurement from Russia.\n\nThe conciliatory remarks from high US officials are not surprising given that the sanctions on India or any of its entities and persons will bring bilateral defence cooperation to a halt, as the Indian Ministry of Defence will not be able to engage its US counterpart, including on arms trade that Admiral Harris was referring to. That, in turn, would force India to reverse its declining arms dependence on Russia, while arresting the upward trend in India-US defence trade. More importantly, any US sanctions on India will be counterproductive to America\u2019s own strategic interests vis-\u00e0-vis China. Needless to say that an adversely affected Indian defence posture will end up tilting the military balance in favour of China, whose military assertion in the Indo-Pacific region bothers both Washington and New Delhi.\n\nThe extent to which CAATSA would affect Indo-US defence relations will depend on what sanctions, if any, Washington decides to impose on New Delhi in view of India\u2019s continued defence cooperation with Russia. As mentioned earlier, the President, through the State Department, is required to impose a minimum of five out of the 12 listed sanctions as and when he takes such a decision. It may, however, be noted that of the 12 listed sanctions, only two \u2014suspension of export licence and ban on American equity/debt investment in Indian entities \u2014have some relevance for India, with others having little practical impact. The suspension of the licences will bar American companies from participating in Indian defence contracts, apart from forcing them to stop providing maintenance support for the defence equipment that India has already bought from the US. The latter will jeopardise India\u2019s defence preparedness in respect to existing inventory of US equipment. It is however to be noted that US companies reneging on on-going contractual obligations citing the US government\u2019s action is not liable to be excused under existing Force Majeure provisions stipulated in the Defence Procurement Procedures.16 On the other hand, as per the MoD\u2019s existing Guidelines on Penalties in Business Dealings with Entities, such reneging of contractual obligations will attract either suspension or ban of the concerned companies.17\n\nThe ban on equity/debt investment will place in jeopardy the Joint Ventures that American defence companies have formed with Indian companies in recent years. Moreover, American companies will be barred in the future from forming any Joint Ventures with their Indian counterparts to take part in several mega procurement contracts that the MoD is aggressively pushing through its newly announced Strategic Partnership (SP) model as part of its Make in India and diversification policies. In other words, the US has much to lose if it imposes CAATSA on India. Besides, it will be a huge set back to the emerging defence and security cooperation that has led to India signing a logistics pact with the US, American arms deals with India booming from near zero to over $15 billion in a matter of less than a decade, the US designating India as a Major Defence Partner, and both countries actively cooperating in various security forums including in the newly formed Quad. Given this, and the fact that Russian weapons in Indian hands do not threaten American national security interests directly, it will be extremely unwise on the part of the US to impose any CAATSA-related sanctions, least of all its two most stringent ones related to export control and equity/debt investment, on India.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile CAATSA is unlikely to be imposed on India anytime soon, it is nonetheless a dampener on an otherwise booming defence relationship between India and the United States. As a sovereign country, India cannot be dictated to go slow or suspend its existing or future defence cooperation with Russia. It is also practically impossible for India to ignore Russia in view of the latter\u2019s importance in meeting some of the critical defence hardware requirements of the Indian armed forces and also because of the overwhelming share of Russian weaponry in the Indian arms inventory, the upkeep of which necessitates New Delhi\u2019s continued dependence on Moscow for the foreseeable future. Indian defence decision makers may like to impress this critical aspect upon their American interlocutors and find suitable mitigation. At the same time, India also needs to be prepared for any eventual CAATSA-related sanctions, which, though unlikely in the immediate future, may surface in the long run. India may safeguard its interests by expanding the scope of its existing guidelines for penalties in business dealings to include a provision for banning defence companies of countries which resort to banning entities of other countries for foreign policy purposes. Moreover, India may also like to be cautious while issuing multi-billion dollar arms tenders to countries that are perceived to be unreliable."

The development, which was part of commemorations under way marking a quarter-century of partnership between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), put the focus on New Delhi\u2019s emphasis on engaging Southeast Asian states this year on the defense side.\n\nAs I have noted before, the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attempted to signal a more action-oriented policy towards ASEAN specifically and East Asia more generally through its Act East Policy, in contrast to India\u2019s original Look East Policy first formulated under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the 1990s (See: \u201cModi Unveils India\u2019s Act East Policy to ASEAN\u201d).\n\n2017 is an especially significant year for ASEAN-India relations, since it marks the 25th anniversary of India becoming a sectoral dialogue partner with ASEAN back in 1992. In early September, as part of the commemorations for the 25th anniversary, the Indian defense ministry disclosed that two Indian Navy ships would proceed on a three-month deployment to East and Southeast Asia covering 12 ports after leaving the Indian port of Visakhapatnam on September 8.\n\nAs I have observed previously, during the deployment, the ships \u2013 the INS Satpura, a multi-role stealth frigate commanded by Captain Rahul Shankar, and the INS Kadmatt, an anti-submarine corvette led by Commander Nithin Cariappa \u2013 were to visit Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Brunei, and Russia. The ships were scheduled for a range of activities in Southeast Asian states, from regular port visits to exercises.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nFrom November 25 to 28, the INS Satpura docked at Muara Port in Brunei after participating in the ASEAN International Fleet Review (IFR) which had been held in Thailand (See: \u201cASEAN\u2019s First Naval Exercise in Perspective\u201d). India and Brunei already have defense collaboration in place in several areas including training, exchanges, and ship visits, with a recent example being when the INS Airavat visited Brunei in May 2016 to participate in the ASEAN Defense Ministers\u2019 Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) exercise on maritime security and counterterrorism hosted by Brunei.\n\nEnjoying this article?

During the visit, the INS Satpura engaged with the Royal Brunei Navy (RBN) in formal calls as well as an array of professional, social, and sporting engagements. The ship was also made open for public visitation during part of its time there. Following the harbor phase, it conducted a Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with the RBN.\n\nFew details were disclosed by officials about the exact nature of the exercises and engagements conducted. But Indian officials said that the INS Satpura would continue on its ASEAN voyage with a stop in Malaysia before finally beginning its return to India. The Malaysia stop is expected to feature an exercise focused on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR)."

    "text": "Denel Dynamics has received another order for its Seeker 400 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) after completing deliveries to the South African National Defence Force. It has also received a small contract for Seeker 200 platforms from a Middle Eastern country.\n\nThe Middle Eastern contract, worth R182 million, was announced at the Dubai air show in November 2017, but it was not at the time specified which models had been ordered. According to Sello Ntsihlele, head of business development at Denel Dynamics, the order was for a small number of Seeker 200s to replenish an existing fleet.\n\nDenel Dynamics has received another order for its larger Seeker 400 UAV, from a customer who cannot yet be disclosed. Ntsihlele told defenceWeb the contract was \u201csubstantial\u201d.\n\nThe South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was the launch customer for the Seeker 400, and took delivery of its first aircraft in late 2015. Ntsihlele said Denel Dynamics was in the process of handing the system over to the SANDF and this would probably conclude by year-end. The company was awarded an interim military type certificate for the Seeker 400 system and additional efforts are underway towards a full military type certification.\n\nInternationally, Ntsihlele said there is huge interest in the Seeker 400, especially the armed version, which can be fitted with lightweight Impi and Impi-S missiles or the unpowered GPS-guided P2. The 14 kg P2 was delivered for a client in the Middle East and has been qualified on the Seeker 200.\n\nThe Seeker 400 is somewhat unusual in that it can carry two sensor payloads (weighing a combined 100 kg) at the same time, such as an optronic sensor turret like the Argos II and a synthetic aperture radar or electronic intelligence package. In this configuration it is known as the Enhanced Seeker 400 and will be shown in this configuration at the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) exhibition at AFB Waterkloof from September 19 to 23. Up until now the Seeker 400 has been fitted with a single sensor payload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seeker 400 can be used for a wide range of military and civilian missions, including maritime surveillance and disaster reconnaissance. It has up to 16 hours endurance at altitudes up to 18 000 feet. At typical operating altitudes of between 4 500 and 9 000 feet, it is not visible from the ground by the human eye and is effectively inaudible. The UAV\u2019s line-of-sight range is 250 km from its ground station, but this can be doubled by using a forward ground station with deployed forces."

    "text": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - At first glance from above it looks like any clean and neatly planned small town, complete with sports grounds, neat roads and large civic buildings.\n\nBut the town is on Subi reef in the Spratlys archipelago of the hotly contested South China Sea and, regional security experts believe, could soon be home to China\u2019s first troops based in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.\n\nPrivate sector data analysis reviewed by Reuters shows Subi, some 1,200 km (750 miles) from China\u2019s coast, is now home to nearly 400 individual buildings \u2013 far more than other Chinese islands.\n\nSubi could be the future location of hundreds of People\u2019s Liberation Army marines, as well as a possible administrative hub as China cements its claim with a civilian presence, security analysts and diplomatic sources say.\n\nThe data from Earthrise Media, a non-profit group supporting independent media with imagery research, was based on surveys of high-resolution images obtained by DigitalGlobe satellites, dating back to when China started dredging reefs in early 2014.\n\nThe images show neat rows of basketball courts, parade grounds and a wide variety of buildings, some flanked by radar equipment.\n\nEarthrise founder Dan Hammer said his team\u2019s count included only free-standing, permanent and recognizable structures.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at these pictures I see a standard PLA base on the mainland \u2013 it is incredible, right down to the basketball courts,\u201d Singapore-based security analyst Collin Koh said after reviewing the data and images.\n\n\u201cAny deployment of troops will be a huge step, however \u2013 and then they will need to secure and sustain them, so the military presence will have to only grow from where it is now.\u201d\n\nSenior Western diplomats describe the placement of troops or jet fighters on the islands as a looming test of international efforts to curb China\u2019s determination to dominate the vital trade waterway.\n\nSubi is the largest of China\u2019s seven man-made outposts in the Spratlys. The so-called \u201cBig Three\u201d of Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs all share similar infrastructure \u2013 including emplacements for missiles, 3km runways, extensive storage facilities and a range of installations that can track satellites, foreign military activity and communications.\n\nMischief and Fiery Cross each house almost 190 individual buildings and structures, according to the Earthrise analysis. The previously unpublished data details the building count on more than 60 South China Sea features, including those occupied by Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Philippines.\n\nWhile the data shows well developed infrastructure on some on islands such as Vietnam's Spratly Island, the Philippines' Thitu Island and Taiwan's Itu Aba, the scale and development by Beijing dwarfs its rivals. (For a multimedia package on the data, click tmsnrt.rs/2J3cWne)\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nThe number of buildings on Subi makes it similar in size to Woody Island in the Paracels, a Beijing-controlled group much closer to China also claimed by Vietnam.\n\nWoody is the base and surveillance post which foreign military attaches say is the headquarters of the military division across the South China Sea, reporting to the PLA\u2019s southern theater command.\n\nKoh and other analysts said the facilities on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross could each hold a regiment - between 1,500 to 2,400 troops.\n\nChina\u2019s precise intentions remain unclear and Chinese experts say much will depend on whether Beijing feels threatened by regional security trends, particularly U.S. activity such as its so-called \u201cfreedom of navigation patrols\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s defense ministry did not respond to Reuters questions about the build-up on Subi or what the facilities could be used for.\n\nBeijing has consistently said the facilities on its reclaimed islands are for civilian use and necessary self-defense purposes. China blames Washington for militarizing the region with their freedom of navigation patrols.\n\nDing Duo, a researcher at the Chinese government-backed National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Beijing needs a military presence in the Spratlys to protect its civilian infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs for how big that presence is depends on the threat assessment China has going forward for the Nansha Islands,\u201d he said, using the Chinese name for the Spratlys.\n\n\u201cThe Nansha region faces severe military pressure, especially since Trump took office and increased freedom of navigation patrols. So China has raised its threat assessment.\u201d\n\nLOOMING TEST\n\nThe White House said this month it had raised concerns with China about its latest militarization after CNBC reported anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems had been installed on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross. [nL1N1SA1VE]\n\nThis weekend, China revealed bombers had conducted take-off and landing training on some of its islands and reefs in preparation for what it called \u201cthe battle for the South China Sea\u201d. [nL3N1SR08Q]\n\nSlideshow ( 6 images )\n\nSome U.S. analysts noted PLA photographs appeared to show a bomber landing on Woody Island in the Paracels, and the Chinese military has yet to confirm planes actually landed on its Spratlys holdings.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon withdrew an invitation for China to join a major naval drill because of Beijing\u2019s continued militarization of its islands in the South China Sea. [nL2N1SU1KU]\n\nAdmiral Philip Davidson, the nominee to be the next commander of all U.S. forces in the Pacific, said last month the bases were now complete and lacked only deployed forces.\n\n\u201cAny forces deployed to the islands would easily overwhelm the military forces of any other South China Sea-claimants,\u201d Davidson told a congressional panel.\n\nSo far, repeated U.S. naval patrols close to Chinese features and growing international naval deployments through the region have had little obvious impact on Beijing\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cThere is a real sense among Western nations that a new strategy is needed, but there is little sign anything meaningful coalescing,\u201d said one senior Western diplomat familiar with discussions across several countries. \u201cThe deployment of jet fighters \u2013 even temporarily \u2013 will sorely test that lack of a cohesive response.\u201d\n\nAlready large Chinese amphibious landing vessels and other ships have used the full-scale naval wharves at Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief \u2013 pointing to what foreign naval officers describe as virtually a permanent presence throughout hotly contested waters.\n\nChinese forces are using their island holdings to police of what Chinese naval officers tell other navies is a \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d \u2013 an ambiguous term that both Asian and Western military officials say holds no basis in international law.\n\nPeople briefed on recent Western intelligence reports describe an intensifying pattern of radio challenges to foreign military ships and aircraft delivered from Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on Fiery Cross.\n\nAustralian officials recently publicized a \u201crobust but polite\u201d Chinese challenge to three of its naval ships plying the South China Sea en route to Vietnam.\n\nSources say such exchanges between Chinese and foreign militaries are far more frequent than is widely known.\n\n\u201cThey have become the rule rather than the exception across significant areas of the South China Sea,\u201d one person familiar with recent Western security reports told Reuters.\n\nShips and aircraft from India, France, Japan, New Zealand and rival claimants Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines have also been similarly warned, according to regional military officials and analysts.\n\nWith the claimed \u201cmilitary alert zone\u201d having no basis in international law or military practice, foreign naval officials routinely stress they are in international waters and continue on their way.\n\nZhang Baohui, a Chinese security expert at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, said Beijing was likely to be cautious about any offensive moves, such as the stationing of combat aircraft.\n\n\u201cNow the islands are complete, I think we will see a degree of caution in Beijing\u2019s next moves,\u201d he said. \u201cSustaining that presence so far from the Chinese coast is a massive undertaking, and I think the deployment of troops and jet fighters would really cross a threshold for China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d\n\nU.S. military officials insist they are leaving little to chance, warning the bases are already helping China project military power into areas once dominated by its neighbors.\n\n\u201cIn short, China is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d Davidson said in his testimony last month."

    "text": "BRUSSELS \u2015 The European Union has agreed to bolster the ailing European defense industry by allocating \u20ac500 million (U.S. $585.19 million) in 2019 and 2020 to the European Defence Industrial Development Programme.\n\nThe EDIDP is a new program aimed at the development, for instance, of drones for military use or a European cyber defense mechanism. Funding is expected to increase to \u20ac1 billion per year from 2021.\n\nIt means increased pan-EU cooperation in major weapons systems such as aircraft, battle tanks and navy ships should now be possible.\n\nBoom or bust? German industry sizes up Euro-defense potential A whitepaper aims to clean up major misunderstandings surrounding the nascent PESCO process, chiefly the assumption that the construct represents a pot of money for which companies can apply.\n\nA European Commission spokesman said the \u201ccore objective\u201d of the funding was to make Europe\u2019s defense industry more competitive and innovative. The program will act as an \u201cenabler for cooperation, incentivising potential collaborative development programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt aims to encourage cooperation in developing the technologies and equipment needed to address common defense and security challenges,\u201d added the spokesman.\n\nWhat remains unclear at this stage, however, is the role and future involvement of the U.K. in EU-funded defense programs after it exits the EU, due to happen at the end of March 2019.\n\nQuestions remain particularly about the impact a British exit will have on the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) and, indeed, on the desirable future agreements between the U.K. and the EU in this area.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith a turnover of \u20ac97.3 billion in 2014, 500,000 people directly employed and 1.2 million indirect jobs, the European defence industry is a major industrial sector. But the European defense market has been shrinking, with NATO saying spending on defense by its 26 European members slipped to about $250 billion in 2014 from $275 billion in 2010.\n\nThe new \u20ac500 million funding, announced Wednesday, is partly designed to the give the sector an economic shot in the arm.\n\nThe deal will now be presented to EU ambassadors for their endorsement on May 29, after which it will be submitted to the European Parliament for a vote and then to the EU member states for final adoption.\n\nIt is expected that the program will finance the first capability projects in 2019.\n\nTo foster the pan-EU development of defense systems, the requirement is that a minimum of three companies from three EU countries participate.\n\nFor prototypes, up to 20 percent of the cost could be covered by the program while for other actions such as design or testing, it can go up to 100 percent.\n\nFor the period 2021-2027 the EU also plans to allocate \u20ac13 billion for the European Defence Fund, a relatively new initiative which has already started to fund pan-European research projects.\n\nThe new funding announcement was welcomed by El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, EU commissioner for the internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises, who said the program \u201cis part of our wider efforts to establish a credible Defence Union which protects its citizens. With this agreement, we are building EU\u2019s strategic autonomy and boosting the competitiveness of the EU defense industry.\u201d\n\nFurther comment came from Krasimir Karakachanov, Deputy Prime Minister for Public Order and Security, Minister for Defence of Bulgaria, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council, who added, \u201cThis agreement will allow the European Union to fund for the first time a programme on defence capabilities. This new step in our security and defence cooperation reflects the importance in today\u2019s world of doing more as Europeans for our own security.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Fran\u00e7oise Grosset\u00eate, a senior French centre right Member of the European Parliament and rapporteur on the issue in Parliament, said, \u201cWe have taken a first and very important step to increase cooperation in the defence industry and strengthen the competitiveness of the EU defence industry.\n\n\u201cThe all-European defense technological and industrial base, in particular our SMEs and mid-caps, will benefit from this program in order to strengthen our strategic autonomy. Excellence and innovation will be the main drivers.\u201d\n\nA source at the European Defence Agency, based in Brussels, said, \u201cmaintenance of a strong and competitive DTIB in Europe is a fundamental underpinning of the European security and defense policy. A robust EDTIB is a prerequisite to the EDA achieving its mission: improving the EU\u2019s defense capabilities."

    "text": "The Minister of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan Yavar Jamalov held a press conference, on December 17, to discuss the outcomes of 2017 for the country\u2019s defense industry sector. The minister pointed out that this past year, two additional military-production factories were built in Azerbaijan. Thus, the total number of defense-manufacturing facilities in the country is now 58 (Trend, December 17, 2017). Moreover, these new factories were fully equipped with modern machinery developed by leading Western defense contractors. The Ministry of Defense Industry plans to launch two more new factories, which will be able to produce four kinds of modern artillery shells, mortars, and armor for military vehicles. Moreover, new military labs will be developed to produce blasting powder, trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexogen (RDX) chemical compounds (Azerbaijan-news.az, December 17, 2017).\n\nSince its establishment, the Ministry of Defense Industry of Azerbaijan has sought to eliminate the country\u2019s military dependence on foreign suppliers and to further develop its mass-production capabilities in the defense sector. Due to the unresolved conflict with its arch-rival Armenia over the Karabakh region, Azerbaijan has significantly raised military expenditures since the beginning of the 2000s (Tradingeconomics.com, accessed January 8). However, anemic energy-export revenues in recent years had forced the government to cut back its defense budget. So the current recovery in the global oil and natural gas price have allowed Baku to somewhat increase its annual military budget for 2018, in particular to boost the domestic defense industry.\n\nThe draft military budget for 2018, released by the Ministry of Finance on October 9, outlines plans to increase the defense budget to 2.73 billion manat ($1.6 billion), representing a 3.7 percent increase over 2017\u2019s allocation of 2.64 billion manat ($1.56 billion). The 2018 allocation includes 1.36 billion manat ($800 million) in funding for the Armed Forces, 0.1 billion ($60 million) for national security and 1.258 billion ($740 million) in other defense expenditures (Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly, October 24, 2017).\n\nAzerbaijan considers the financial boost to the defense industry especially vital, particularly in the aftermath of the tense situation along the Line of Contact (LoC) in the Karabakh region, following the four-day war in April of 2016 (see EDM, April 6, 2016; May 5, 2016; May 11, 2016). Azerbaijan\u2019s active usage of domestically produced weaponry during the April conflict further prompted Baku to increase local production and more heavily rely on it. Thus, Yavar Jamalov confirmed that Azerbaijan has launched preliminary tests of domestic unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) capable of striking human targets and enemy\u2019s military equipment. The Ministry is currently concentrating its efforts on developing the Zarba-1K, a local derivative of the Israeli-produced Aeronautics Orbiter 1K. \u201cMoreover, negotiations on the creation of electropulse [sic] weapons are being conducted with a number of countries,\u201d he said (CBC, December 18, 2017). The production of various unmanned drones, armor for vehicles, machine guns, and sniper rifles is mostly being carried out by Azerbaijan\u2019s \u201cAlov,\u201d \u201cAgregat\u201d and \u201cAZAD\u201d military factories.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense Industry is readying to complete and present 17 new, next-generation domestically produced weapons, some of which will be developed jointly with the Azerbaijani National Aerospace Agency. The priority in 2018 will be given to the production of the new \u201cTufan\u201d (Storm) armored military vehicle\u2014the first fully domestically produced vehicle, featuring a stabilized remote-controlled weapons system (RWS), and equipped with a 12.7-millimeter NVS machine gun, a 40-millimeter QP-25 grenade-launcher, a 107-millimeter Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), and a domestically produced long-range missile system (Milli.az, December 17, 2017). Mass production of the Tufan will start in 2018. The vehicle will come in four varieties: medical evacuation, air-defense/ anti-armor, anti-riot and a basic armored personnel carrier (APC). Azerbaijan is also developing a version that will be available for export.\n\nAs the military budget gradually grows this year, the national defense industry is expected to undergo further expansion in 2018, which means that the country\u2019s military exports will likely also grow. According to Defense Industry Minister Jamalov, Azerbaijan currently exports weapons to more than ten foreign countries. In 2016, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Defense Industry increased the volume of defense-industry production by 1.6 times, compared to 2015, while the product assortment rose by 1.8 times (Qafqazinfo.az, December 17, 2017). In this regard, Azerbaijan strives to increase military exports, while decreasing imports of weaponry from other countries. While much of Azerbaijan\u2019s military production must be attributed to joint ventures\u2014especially with Israeli (see EDM, September 25, 2017), Turkish (see EDM, October 26, 2017) and South-African companies\u201431 domestic production sites currently produce entirely homegrown technology (Trend, July 11, 2017).\n\nIn light of ongoing violence and tensions with Armenia over Karabakh, and repeated failure to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict, Azerbaijan is prioritizing efforts to boost its defense industry in 2018. And as its domestic military manufacturers continue to be ever more innovative and self-sufficient, Baku will seek to carve out an increasingly larger share of the global arms market."

This is the second year the NNSA was slated for a budget increase, although the FY18 request \u2014 $13.9 billion, an increase of 7.8 percent over the FY17 omnibus level \u2014 has yet to be enacted.\n\nThe Nuclear Posture Review, released Feb. 2, called for the development of two new nuclear weapons capabilities, as well as heavy investment in infrastructure to support the nuclear arsenal. But just how NNSA would do in the new budget, which has sometimes struggled with funding in comparison to the broader defense budget, was unclear.\n\nOf the NNSA\u2019s budget, just more than $11 billion are dedicated to weapons activity. The agency is currently doing a massive refresh on its warhead programs, which involves refurbishing and redesigning five warhead variants.\n\nMeanwhile, the Government Accountability Office has warned that NNSA is underfunded for its needs.\n\nThe funding will be welcomed by proponents of the NNSA, particularly after comments from the previous administrator, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Frank Klotz, that his agency was \u201cat capacity.\u201d\n\nNotably, the NNSA could be in line for another plus-up in the FY20 budget. Speaking during the NPR rollout, Steve Erhart, acting undersecretary for nuclear security and NNSA administrator, said to expect \u201cmore fidelity in the budget request in the following year, FY20.\u201d"

These are opportunities we constantly engage upon and try to educate user population what products we have to offer and how we can provide a solution to the operational requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, he said the company is interested in other opportunities which may help enhance its operations and products.\n\nHe said Sikorsky has recently approved a maintenance repair overhaul facility in Thailand.\n\n\u201cWe can look to other things such as logistics, where you may have it for stocking location. We are always looking for that.

Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen/via REUTERS\n\nU.S. export control laws can be used to limit European weapons sales if even small components come from U.S. suppliers. That legislation was in place prior to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, but the industry has grown increasingly worried that his administration is acting to halt exports that might have been permitted in the past.\n\nWashington has this year blocked the sale to Egypt of French-made SCALP cruise missiles, which contain a U.S. part.\n\nWithout giving specific examples, Defence Minister Florence Parly said France needed to \u201cgradually wean ourselves off our reliance on a certain number of American parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had trade difficulties linked to the prospects for exports. And we know that these difficulties are linked to strategic questions and often to problems of commercial rivalry,\u201d she told a small group of journalists.\n\nShe was quizzed on the subject in July by parliament\u2019s defense committee.\n\nAsked at that time by one lawmaker about the blocked SCALP sale, Parly said: \u201cWe are at the mercy of the Americans.\u201d\n\nParly said Washington\u2019s actions underlined the need to minimize dependence on U.S. parts in the Future Combat Air System (SCAF) project - Europe\u2019s next-generation combat jet which France and Germany are taking the lead in developing.\n\nFrance\u2019s Dassault Aviation and European planemaker Airbus have signed a deal to work together on the jet, which is expected to be at the center of a broader weapons system capable of commanding a squadron of drones.\n\nFrance\u2019s air force uses Reaper drones, built by U.S. firm General Atomics, in its counter-terrorism operations against Islamist militants. Parly said France had needed U.S. congressional approval to arm the drones.\n\n\u201cIs that satisfactory? No. But we don\u2019t have any choice,\u201d she said."

    "text": "It's one of the most secretive states on Earth, a perennial thorn in the side of the West and it has just conducted a claimed underground test of a hydrogen bomb. But how scared should we be of North Korea and its military? \"Supreme Power\"\n\nUnder the 'Songun' (military-first) policy, the Korean People's Army (how the state's entire military is known) is the central institution of government and society. The \"supreme repository of power\", it guides domestic and foreign policy. The country achieves its massive personnel numbers (see below) through universal conscription for men and selective conscription for women. Troops serve a minimum of 10 years of military service, starting at the age of 17.\n\nUnusually, almost all officers start their careers as privates, with only a select few attending military academies without prior service. The result is an egalitarian system where officers understand the lives of lower ranks, with little of the \"military nobility\" evident in other nations. The Numbers North Korea has the second largest number of total military personnel in the world - with 7,679,000 troops out of an approximate population of 25 million. There are 1,190,000 active, 6,300,000 reserve and 189,000 paramilitary personnel.\n\nThe Young Red Guards form part of North Korea's paramilitary force\n\nThe only country to have more troops? South Korea. The North's sworn enemies have 8,134,500 personnel - with 630,000 of those active, 7,500,000 reserve and 4,500 paramilitary. It's hard to know the North's exact military budget, but it's been estimated at around 20.8 per cent of its $40 billion (\u00a333bn) - again estimated - Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By comparison, the US spent $597bn (\u00a3494bn) in 2015, 3.3 per cent of GDP. Britain is spending $65bn (\u00a354bn) this fiscal year and has pledged to spend 2% of GDP on defence for the next three years.\n\nMost of North Korea's arms are supplied by China and Russia, while annual military exports amount to around $100 million (\u00a383m). Its Supreme Commander is, of course, 'Marshal' Kim Jong-un, the country's president. (Personnel figures according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2017.) The Army North Korea has 950,000 active Army personnel, with most soldiers armed with locally-produced Kalashnikov-type rifles like the Type 58 assault rifle. The Army also uses ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, which are banned under the UN Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons.\n\nLike its southern rivals, it has been maintaining a large number armoured vehicles for decades. Although some are now produced domestically, most are Soviet-made. It boasts 5,500 tanks and 2,200 infantry fighting vehicles. By comparison, Britain has 227 tanks and 2,319 more heavily armoured fighting vehicles. North Korea also has 8,600 artillery pieces and 4,800 multiple rocket launcher systems.\n\nA North Korean multiple rocket launcher system alongside a captured heavy artillery piece\n\nSouth Korea's Army, meanwhile, has 2,500 main battle tanks, 5,800 artillery pieces, 2,700 armoured fighting vehicles, 60 guided missile systems and 600 helicopters, along with 495,000 troops. It's also, crucially, got the continuous supporting presence of the US, which has 28,500 personnel stationed in the country.\n\nUS submariners raising the flag as they arrive in South Korea\n\nThe Navy While North Korea's Navy is anything but conventional, it is capable of accomplishing key missions. It's undoubtedly, however, weak in a traditional sense. With up to 60,000 sailors, the country's naval strengths lie in submarine warfare. Of its 810 vessels, 70 are submarines and 10 midget submarines. The strongest element of its surface fleet, meanwhile, is its three known frigates and four corvettes. The rest of the fleet is made of minehunters and sweepers, smaller boats and hovercraft. Around half of the overall 800+ total, however, is estimated to be tank landing ships, which would only be used in case of an invasion.\n\nOne of two North Korean Najin-class light frigates\n\nUltimately, North Korea's navy has one overarching mission - defending the Kim regime from outside attack - although it's also used for asymmetric warfare against the South and intelligence gathering. The main problem for the country is that its long economic decline seems to have made it incapable of building warships larger than 200 tons. As a result, it's considered a 'brown water navy', as opposed to seaworthy 'blue-water' navies, which can conduct operations in open ocean. It also has the unusual and undesirable distinction of having two navies - one based on the East coast and one on the West - which can't support, or even reach, each other.\n\nThe country's East and West fleets can't reach each other\n\nWith no sea passage from one side of country to the other (see above), the limited range of most of its vessels makes it near-impossible for a ship on one coast to visit the other. So the navies operate mainly within the 50km exclusion zone off land. The Air Force Unusually, North Korea's Air Force has significantly more manpower than the Navy, with an estimated 110,000 personnel. Again though, it currently exists mostly as a defensive force, with its primary task to defend North Korean airspace. Even so, it has 940 aircraft, mostly of Soviet and Chinese origin.\n\nNorth Korea's most numerous fighter, the MiG-21PF, seen here in service with Vietnam's Air Force\n\nThe state also has a high saturation of multi-layered, overlapping, mutually supporting air defence sites boasting anti-aircraft artillery and surface-to-air missiles. Although much of the equipment is outdated, the density of air defence capability would prove a serious challenge to enemy air attack. A Nuclear Threat?\n\nOne of the most concerning North Korean capabilities is, of course, its much-debated nuclear weapons threat. The country declared in 2009 that it had developed a nuclear weapon, and possessed a small stockpile. It's also carried out a number of high-profile tests - six, in fact, since 2006. America lies just under 6,500 miles from North Korea, putting the US within striking distance.\n\nAllies like Japan, and US bases in regions like Guam and South Korea, are of course much closer - with the North saying it is examining its plans for attacking Guam. There's been little past evidence that the country could ensure an accurate strike though, or even bring an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) down to hit its target. Officials with South Korea's defence ministry, however say they have seen preparations in the North for an ICBM test to show off its claimed ability to target the US. Other Capabilities The Pentagon believes North Korea probably has a chemical weapons program - which is prohibited under international law - and is likely to possess a stockpile of weapons. It's also been developing cyber warfare capabilities since the 1980s, with around 1,800 highly-trained hackers in the secretive Bureau 121 - the country's elite cyber warfare unit - as of 2014. In December of that year, the unit was accused of using its capability to hack Sony and make threats, leading to the cancellation of a global theatrical release of The Interview, a film which lampooned Kim Jong-un.\n\nSo how big a threat does North Korea pose? We'll leave that for you to decide... With thanks to Uri Tours and the Pacific Aviation Museum for Photography. More: Royal Navy's New Sea Ceptor Air Defence Missiles Tested"

    "text": "WASHINGTON: The Polish government is working to renegotiate an arms deal approved by the State Department last year for the U.S.-made HIMARS long-range rocket artillery system after experiencing some sticker shock when seeing the final price tag.\n\nThe $250 million package for the rocket launcher along with guided warheads and other tactical missiles was seen as a way for Poland and NATO to push back against the Russian military buildup in neighboring Kaliningrad, which gives Moscow the ability to track and knock down Polish aircraft over Polish airspace. The HIMARS, Polish officials told me, would give them the ability to hit targets at a longer range if their aircraft were unable to fly.\n\nBut almost six months on, the deal remains a work in progress even as the Trump administration has kicked off a new initiative to eliminate red tape, speed up timelines, and cut costs for sales of U.S. military equipment to allies overseas.\n\nMaj. Gen. Cezary Wi\u015bniewski \u2014 a former F-16 pilot now serving as Poland\u2019s Defense Attache to the United States \u2014 told me during a recent conversation at the Polish consulate here, his government very much wants to move forward with the HIMARS deal, but can\u2019t at the current price. The Polish government and HIMARS-maker Lockheed Martin continue to hash out possibilities for making the deal happen, but neither side would, for the moment, give much insight on how to bring costs down.\n\nWi\u015bniewski said that the mobile rocket artillery system remains a priority due to the continued Russian buildup in Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea that allows Russian radars and S-400 missile systems to reach deep inside Polish territory, essentially taking away any home field advantage Polish pilots might have in the event of a conflict.\n\nCrucially, the deal also supports a Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) between Lockheed and PGZ, Poland\u2019s state-run defense group, which is the prime contractor in Poland.\n\nA spokesperson for Lockheed told me that the company \u201cis fully committed\u201d to working the deal, and \u201chas remained engaged and flexible with PGZ, ready to finalize a [missile defense] offering that will provide commonality and interoperability with U.S. forces and NATO partners.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Warsaw wants out of the deal are offsets, which would allow PGZ to build components in Poland.\n\nJust last month, as part of inking the largest arms deal in Polish history \u2014 a $4.75 billion contract for Patriot air defense systems and other associated equipment \u2014 Lockheed, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman agreed to offsets worth about $280 million.\n\nNegotiations over Phase II of that Patriot program began on April 16, and include talks about buying a 360 degree radar, and additional offsets.\n\n\u201cWe would like to procure the same 360 degree radar that is under development by the U.S. Army,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said. \u201cIt has not been selected by the Army, yet so we are waiting. We would like to use the same system so the integration and sustainment costs would be lower.\u201d\n\nBut the Polish government is also looking to shift more work to its own defense industry. \u201cWe expect the Phase II would provide us more technology transfer than Phase I,\u201d Wi\u015bniewski said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking for more technology transfer for our industry.\u201d\n\nOne key element of the current negotiations is Raytheon\u2019s low-cost SkyCeptor interceptor missile, which would be used in a nascent short-range interceptor program called Narew, which Warsaw wants to build locally, according to Wi\u015bniewski.\n\nThe general described a gap in the budding Polish air defense ecosystem between shoulder-fired MANPADS and the Patriot, a gap that will be filled by Narew, which his government considers crucial in bulking up its borders with Kaliningrad and providing the NATO alliance with more ground punch.\n\n\u201cIt helps us to deter,\u201d he said.\n\nAnalysis haven\u2019t been surprised by the Polish interest in more air defenses, and its willingness to spend a lot of money to acquire the. \u201cI think this is a natural case of Poland looking to balance Russian military modernization and leverage their sizable defense budget to adjust for a new generation of capabilities deployed in Kaliningrad,\u201d said Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at CNA. \u201cOf course there is also the political aspect to defense procurement, seeking to leverage defense spending as another instrument to further build ties with the United States,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe original HIMARS announcement in November was part of a wave of big buys \u2014 including September\u2019s $1.25 billion agreement to sell the HIMARS and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Romania, who also agreed on a deal for seven Patriot Configuration 3 units in November \u2014 that signaled to Moscow that the alliance was was meeting Russian buildups in Kaliningrad and Crimea.\n\nAny HIMARS deal with Poland would be significant for NATO, as other than Romania, the only foreign buyers have been Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, while Qatar has received authorization to buy the system.\n\nThe government in Bucharest announced during in the summer of 2017 that it planned to buy HIMARS, along with 36 F-16 fighter jets by 2022, part of a long-term pan to lay out $11.6 billion on military procurements between 2017 through 202"

In her role as a helicopter carrier and amphibious assault ship, Ocean is designed to deliver troops by helicopter or by landing craft.\n\nAfter her decommissioning was announced, Brazilian media reports rumored the HMS Ocean could be sold to the Brazilian Navy for a \u201creasonable price\u201d. That price, according to reports, is \u00a380 million pounds.\n\nSecond helicopter carrier for Turkey\n\nTurkey is already building a landing helicopter dock which is based on the Spanish Navy\u2019s (LHD) Juan Carlos I and designed by Navantia. The Turkish version of the ship will be named TCG Anadolu and have the pennant number L-408.\n\nFirst steel on the ship, which will be registered as a light aircraft carrier by the Turkish Lloyd, was cut in May 2016 while delivery is scheduled for 2021."

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The budget unveiled Monday by the Trump administration will see a drastic 70 percent\u201369.6 percent\u2013cut in aid to Armenia over the fiscal year 2017 budget, which allocated $22.4 million in assistance to Armenia. Trump\u2019s budget is calling for a $6.8 million aid package to Armenia.\n\n\u201cWe are troubled by President Trump\u2019s ill-advised and misguided proposal to sharply cut aid to Armenia. His budget recommendation underscores the need to work with Congressional appropriators to reverse these reductions, while redoubling our efforts to empower Armenia\u2019s aid-to-trade transition,\u201d said Aram Hamparian, Executive Director of the Armenian National Committee of America.\n\n\u201cBuilding on 2015\u2019s Trade and Investment Framework Agreement and leveraging the five hundred million dollars in new U.S. investments in Armenia, we need to put in place a badly-needed Double Tax Treaty, launch direct Los Angeles to Yerevan flights, secure an MCC Science and Technology education grant for Armenian schools, and undertake other targeted commercial initiatives to strengthen the U.S.-Armenia bilateral economic relationship,\u201d added Hamparian.\n\nUnder the Administration\u2019s budget, aid to Armenia would be reduced by 70 percent, dropping from $22.4 million in FY17 to $6.8 million proposed for FY18. The Trump budget also reduces assistance to Azerbaijan by 90 percent as compared with FY16 to $1 million.\n\nThe Trump budget request for Armenia envisions $4 million in Economic Support and Development Fund, $1.5 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, and $700,000 for Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related Programs. Military parity between Armenia and Azerbaijan is maintained in the proposed budget with each receiving $600,000 for International Military Education and Training and cuts Foreign Military Financing to both countries. In the FY17 budget $1 million was allocated for FMF.\n\nIn early April, the Congressional Armenian Caucus called on key U.S. House appropriators to prioritize Fiscal Year 2018 foreign aid policies \u201cstrengthening Armenia\u2019s independence, promoting peace in Nagorno Karabakh, and supporting Armenia as a regional safe haven for at-risk Middle East refugees.\n\nAmong the specific priorities advanced by the Caucus were:\n\n\u2014 U.S. support for Armenia as a regional safe haven for Middle East refugees, in the form of a $40 million appropriation to support transitional programs, including short-term housing/rental assistance and social and economic integration initiatives.\n\n\u2014 A renewed focus on aid to Artsakh, with an appropriation of at least $8 million for de-mining, rehabilitation programs (such as the Lady Cox Rehabilitation Center), and water supply systems.\n\n\u2014 A focused effort to check Azerbaijani aggression, through the appropriation of at least $20 million to support implementation of the Royce-Engel peace proposals, the suspension of U.S. military aid to Baku, and the strengthening of Section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act.\n\n\u2014 An appropriation of at least $40 million in economic aid to Armenia, and no less than $11 million in military aid, with a focus on advancing U.S.-Armenia defense cooperation goals, promoting NATO interoperability, and supporting increased Armenia\u2019s participation in global peacekeeping operations.\n\nIn March, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Democrat Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Congressional Armenian Caucus Co-Chair Frank Pallone (D-NJ) delivered powerful testimony before key House foreign aid appropriators, calling for the expansion of U.S. assistance to Artsakh and Armenia, and the implementation of measures to check escalating Azerbaijani aggression.\n\nANCA\u2019s Hamparian also noted that the organization will continue working with congressional leaders to ensure that a portion of the Trump\u2019s proposed $2.75 billion allocated to Migration and Refugee Assistance would go to Armenia, which has accepted a large number of refugees from Syria over the course of the past several years."

(IAI).\n\nThe contract \u201cis likely to be signed in the coming weeks,\u201d German parliament member Fritz Felgentreu, responsible for defense affairs in the German Social Democratic Party, told Globes.\n\nThe sources in Berlin told Defense News that the German Ministry of Defense's request for approval of the UAV deal could be approved soon. Government sources who favor the deal are stressing the argument that Germany's friendship with Israel should guide the decision-making process, and this consideration carries weight in the Bundestag.\n\nUnder the program, the UAVs will be stationed in Israel under the management of the military wing of Airbus, at least in the first stage. The UAVs are initially designated for intelligence missions, such as aerial photography and surveillance of enemy forces. At a later stage, they are also likely to be used to attack ground targets, including targeted killings.\n\nThe UAVs are due to become available to the German army starting at the end of 2019."

Officials at the Canadian Embassy in Berlin weren't immediately able to comment.\n\nGermany ordered the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk variant in 2000 to use for long-distance reconnaissance, but later canceled the order because of skyrocketing costs and revelations that the prototype wouldn't be certified to fly in Europe. Then-Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere acknowledged in 2013 that the drone was a write-off, telling lawmakers it was better to have a \"horrible end than a horror without end.\"\n\nLast year, the government acknowledged that the development and procurement of the prototype, a signals-intelligence sensor called \"ISIS\" and spare parts, and the completion of seven test flights had cost about 681 million euros since 2007. A further 24 million euros were spent on preparing for a resumption of temporary test flights.\n\nAccording to the government's latest response to Left Party lawmakers, which hasn't been published yet, the drone has already been \"demilitarized.\" This entailed the removal of American-made radio equipment, the GPS receiver and aerials, as well as all encryption and the flight control system. Rather than laboriously delete individual software components, technicians chose to perform a \"hardware uninstallation\" \u2014 removing all hard drives containing sensitive U.S.-made software.\n\n\"The question is what a buyer would do with such a gutted aircraft,\" said Thomas Wiegold, a German journalist who runs the defense website Augen Geradeaus . \"Without GPS navigation and in particular without flight control systems, the drone would hardly be able to fly.\"\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nAndrej Hunko, one of the Left Party lawmakers who submitted questions to the government, said the drone now only has \"scrap value.\"\n\n\"The sale will therefore recoup at best a small portion of the tax money spent,\" he said. \"I expect the loss will amount to several hundred million euros (dollars).\""

    "text": "Following our detailed analysis of the H225/AS332L2 fleet movements yesterday there is one other key contract for H225s which we can now provide more details to.\n\nIn late May, the French Government announced that Airbus signed a \u20ac555 million ($643M) deal with Ukraine for 55 helicopters. The Ukraine Government have said that this covers 24 H125s, 10 H145s and 21 H225s [all other aviation press reports have wrongly claimed the split between H125 and H145s had not been revealed]. Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov has detailed that the 21 H225s are split further into 3 SAR models and 18 for transport roles.\n\nTo fund the purchase of these 55 helicopters, Ukraine will be borrowing all \u20ac555 million at 4.25% per annum from the State Treasury of France and a consortium of French banks. The deal includes setting up a maintenance base in Ukraine and training of both pilots and engineers.\n\nHowever, it is that figure of 21 H225s which raises our interest further.\n\nFurther investigation has found that some/most/all 21 H225s for Ukraine are ex-offshore H225s currently owned by leasing companies. Once source narrows that down to the 21 being \u201cowned by French banks\u201d and it is unlikely to be a coincidence that Parilease \u2013 the leasing arm of French bank BNP Paribas \u2013 has a fleet of precisely 21 H225s parked up, and three of these were in SAR specification for North Sea work off Norway. All 21 are currently on the Isle of Man aircraft register and are reportedly stored in France. The fleet were hand-backs or repossessions from the Chapter 11 process of operator CHC.\n\nIn October 2016, the helicopter trading company Avinco announced that they had struck a deal \u201cto recover, manage and remarket a fleet of EC225s previously operated by CHC following the operator\u2019s filing for Chapter 11\u201d, and that the fleet consisted of 18 in offshore configuration and 3 with SAR equipment. HeliHub.com revealed that the leasing company could only be Parilease.\n\nWhile we agree that there is some conjecture here and no 100% proof yet, it seems beyond the chance of possibility that the Ukraine H225 fleet purchases are all ex CHC offshore repossessions or hand-backs.\n\nJeremy Parkin \u2013 HeliHub.com\n\nRelated Posts"

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 The German government has presented an ambitious plan for beefing up the country\u2019s armed forces over the next 10-plus years.\n\nThe strategy comes in the form of a new \u201ccapability profile,\u201d described by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen as a \u201cgrand, comprehensive modernization concept.\u201d At its intermediate point, by 2024, it proposes Germany\u2019s annual defense budget at 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, or about \u20ac60 billion (U.S. $69 billion).\n\nThat would amount to a sizable increase for a country currently hovering around a GDP of \u20ac40 billion. But it would still fall short of the NATO-wide objective of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense.\n\nIn von der Leyen\u2019s telling, the new strategy would lift the armed forces from years of budget cutbacks and deprivation toward a set of capabilities deep enough to defend the homeland and simultaneously partake in out-of-area missions.\n\nIn the telling of critics, the strategy amounts to little more than wishful thinking because it assumes defense spending way above what is currently on the table.\n\nThe Social Democrats, which hold the reigns of the Finance Ministry in the current coalition government, previously rejected the type of stark budget boosts that the Defence Ministry believes is needed to plug longstanding shortfalls.\n\nGerman defense budget angers critics \u2014 including the defense minister Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Cabinet has approved a draft federal budget considered so insufficient for the armed forces by Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen that she submitted a formal note of protest along with her vote.\n\nAccording to a summary of the classified document released by the Defence Ministry, there are two priorities in the envisioned spending spree: soldier equipment and bringing the Bundeswehr up to speed in cyber capabilities.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nGermany\u2019s role in 2023 as a framework nation for the NATO Very High Readiness Joint Task Force will mark the first milestone in the government\u2019s plan, which goes out to 2031. Berlin is expected to provide a modernized \u201cbrigade-equivalent\u201d force package including air and naval components.\n\nIn accordance with another strategy document released last month, an updated concept of operations for the Bundeswehr, the new capability framework is built around the idea that there will be parity between the fundamental missions of defending Germany's territory and conducting overseas missions.\n\nWhile seeming trivial at first, that proclamation will have far-reaching, practical consequences on spending. Over the past years, defense leaders have routinely accepted shortfalls in home-station training to ensure troops in combat zones have the best possible equipment. Formally elevating the importance of homeland defense in the armed forces' planning means pumping new money into an area that officials say has been chronically underfunded.\n\nThe coming months will show how lawmakers, and especially those of the Social Democratic Party, will react to the proposal. Fritz Felgentreu, one of the party\u2019s leading voices on defense matters, told the Tagesschau website that the new strategy reads like a \u201cwell-thought-out wish list.\u201d He said he wants to see a \u201cconcrete analysis\u201d of exactly where additional money is needed."

    "text": "Burma Military Requests Slightly Higher Budget than Last Year for 2018-19\n\nMilitary appointees attend the resumption of Parliament in Naypitaw on July 23. / Htet Naing Zaw / The Irrawaddy\n\nYANGON \u2014 The Ministry of Defense has requested a budget of 3.26 trillion kyats for fiscal 2018-19, which starts in October.\n\nThe request is equivalent to 13.07 percent of the annual budget, estimated at nearly 25 trillion kyats.\n\nOn Wednesday, representatives of 22 ministries, and those of 11 Union-level departments, offices and other entities under the National League for Democracy-led government, began presenting to the Union Parliament their initial budget requests for October 2018 through September 2019. This will be the first fiscal year since the switch to an Oct. 1-Sept. 30 calendar; the country is currently operating on a provisional six-month budget (March-August 2018).\n\nBudget requests were presented Wednesday by six of the 11 Union-level bodies (the Union Government Office, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Constitutional Court, Auditor General\u2019s Office, Union Election Commission, and parliamentary offices) and 11 ministries (Defense; Home Affairs; Border Affairs; Foreign Affairs; the State Counselor\u2019s Office; Information; Religion and Culture; Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation; Transport and Communications; Natural Resources and Environmental Preservation; and the President\u2019s Office). Government representatives will continue their presentations on Thursday.\n\nMajor-General Myint Nwe, the deputy minister of defense, told the Parliament on Wednesday that this year\u2019s defense budget request represents an increase of 57.114 billion kyats from last year\u2019s actual budget of 3.19 trillion kyats.\n\nExplaining the increase, Maj-Gen. Myint New said the requested budget is necessary to implement the Myanmar Military (or Tatmadaw)\u2019s long-term plan to transform itself into a \u201cstandard Army, Navy and Air Force.\u201d\n\nHe said the budget covers the cost of salaries and support for military personnel, weaponry, building construction, military operations and other expenses. He did not reveal precise figures of military personnel or details of the equipment the Tatmadaw plans to purchase.\n\nThe military budget has accounted for approximately 13 to above 14 percent of the national budget since fiscal 2012-13. Sai Thiha Kyaw, a Lower House lawmaker from the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, told The Irrawaddy, \u201cI realize the military budget is around 13-14 percent, although the annual overall budget increases every year. However, [the Tatmadaw\u2019s] use of weapons and warfare equipment machinery are of high standard.\u201d\n\nThe defense budget accounted for 13.9 percent of the total budget in 2017-18, 14.3 percent in 2016-17, more than 13.6 percent in 2015-16, 12.7 percent in 2014-15, nearly 13.3 percent in 2013-14, just over 14 percent in 2012-13 and more than 14.6 percent in 2011-12, and is projected to account for 13 percent of spending next year (2018-19).\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the largest shares of next year\u2019s total budget are requested by the ministries of Finance and Planning (22.9 percent); Electricity and Energy (22.2 percent); Defense (13.07 percent); Education (8.7 percent); Transport and Communications (5.3 percent); and Health and Sport (4.6 percent).\n\nThe Ministry of Finance and Planning also tops the list of projected proportional income, accounting for 42.6 percent of the estimated government total, followed by the ministries of Electricity and Energy (25.7 percent) and Transport and Communications (8 percent).\n\nThe state budget includes estimated expenditure of 24.954 trillion kyats, against estimated income 20.051 trillion kyats, including foreign loans. This leaves a budget deficit of 4.9 trillion kyats. The coming year\u2019s budget is higher than the April 2017-March 2018 fiscal year budget, which included total expenditure of 20.59 trillion kyats and a budget deficit of 4.38 percent.\n\nThe increase is partly due to an increase in foreign debt to over USD10 billion, from around USD9 billion last year, Sai Thiha Kyaw said.\n\nHe said the Union budget estimate excludes state and regional budgets estimates. However, the Union will support the total 1.794 trillion-kyat deficits of the state and regional budgets via the Union Fund. State/regional budget expenses amount to an estimated 2.859 trillion kyats, while their incomes amount to 1.065 trillion kyats, he said.\n\nThe Union Parliament\u2019s 20 joint assessment teams will assess the budget requests and submit them to the Public Accounts Committee over the next two months. That committee will decide whether to approve the budgets before October, said Sai Thiha Kyaw, who is a member of the committee."

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 Germany may be unable to deliver on its pledge to increase the defense budget due to smaller-than-expected economic growth, according to a new Finance Ministry analysis.\n\nThe projections peg the military budget to be several billion euros short of the trajectory to meet the government\u2019s goal of reaching 1.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2024. Analysts even see the current spending curve unable to sustain 1.35 percent in the years ahead.\n\nNATO members in 2014 agreed to boost their defense spending to 2 percent of GDP within 10 years.\n\nDenmark ups defense budget Denmark will increase its defense budget, though not for a few years.\n\nGermany\u2019s defense budget is roughly \u20ac43 billion (U.S. $49 billion) for 2019, or about 1.2 percent of GDP. That is a boost of \u20ac4 billion over the previous year.\n\nDefence Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Monday said Germany remains committed to hitting the self-declared 1.5 percent target in 2024. She portrayed the Finance Ministry\u2019s analysis as a mere first step toward a budget proposal negotiated by Cabinet secretaries. The government is expected to unveil such a plan in late March.\n\nThe Trump administration has often criticized Germany for underspending on defense, arguing Berlin rides on American coattails when it comes to security. News that the country\u2019s spending target is at risk is sure to embolden the narrative in Washington that Europe is somehow taking advantage of the United States. It could weaken the negotiating position of German government delegates at two high-profile events in mid-February: a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, and the Munich Security Conference.\n\nThe Finance Ministry\u2019s economic outlook estimates that agencies will have to reconcile new spending priorities within their previously established budget targets. That means no fresh money would become available for the government\u2019s push on artificial intelligence, for example, according to the document."

It is also expecting other aircraft this year.\n\nAccording to the Lusaka Times, Deputy Commander of the Zambia Air Force David Muma said the two C-27Js will be delivered in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nHe was speaking on 15 December at an annual ball at Livingstone Air Base. He said other acquisitions were on the way and thanked the government for modernising the Zambia Air Force through the acquisition of aircraft, air defence equipment and construction of support infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe recently received 450 unmanned aerial vehicles or drones which are currently based at ZAF Mumbwa air force base. The acquisition of the drones will enhance our surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and in the first quarter of 2018, two Spartan aircraft will be delivered and this will increase the flying capacity of air transport support command,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said ZAF was in the process of establishing a school of excellence which was to include the delivery of 15 aircraft for training purposes.\n\nIn September 2015 Finmeccanica-Alenia Aermacchi announced that an undisclosed African air force had ordered two C-27J Spartan transport aircraft, to become the third African customer after Chad and Morocco. The two aircraft were originally scheduled to be delivered from 2017.\n\nThe Spartan was developed from the G.222/C-27A, using the engines and systems of the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules to provide 30% lower operating costs than the G.222 and 35% greater range. It first flew on September 24, 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Spartan offers the ability to carry up to 60 troops in high density configuration and a maximum of 46 paratroopers. In the medical role 36 stretchers and six attendants can be carried. Normal payload is 9 000 kg for the C-27J, although maximum payload is more than 10 tons."

    "text": "DAVAO CITY -- President Rodrigo Duterte is not keen on the United States' offer of new military equipment in support of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' (AFP) modernization program.\n\n\n\nThe President made this statement in response to a letter signed by three US officials--Secretary Wilbur Ross of the Department of Commerce, Secretary Michael Pompeo of the US State Department and US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis--who all want to meet President Duterte to discuss the country's military\u2019s modernization program.\n\n\n\nPresident Duterte said he is not interested in acquiring M16 rifles from the US. Duterte said he was also more interested in acquiring propeller planes for the anti-insurgency campaign.\n\n\n\nIn the first place, Duterte said he was unsure the US Congress would approve the arms deal to the Philippines.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow sure are you that I will get what I ordered? If I bought a dozen M16 rifles, will they deliver them?\u201d Duterte asked, directing the questions to the three senior US officials.\n\n\n\nThe letter, which came following Duterte\u2019s pronouncement to secure military equipment from Russia, was read by the President before soldiers, local officials and guests during the 12th anniversary of the Eastern Mindanao Command at Naval Forces Eastern Mindanao camp in Panacan here on Thursday evening.\n\n\n\nStill, Duterte said he was thinking of meeting the three US top officials as long as the venue is within the country.\n\n\n\nThe letter highlighted the country\u2019s partnership with the US built on shared history and values. \u201cThis special relationship will only grow stronger by increasing our dialogue especially on security cooperation and trade,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\n\nHe said Pompeo, Mattis, and Ross noted that Manila\u2019s purchase of US military equipment would exemplify the US-Philippines continuing commitment to the breadth and the strength of the two countries' alliance.\n\n\n\nDuterte, however, said the Philippines and the US are friends because \u201cyou make us a colony many years ago. It\u2019s a friendship imposed on us.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the US will need to do more to prove its sincerity, as he recalled the suspension of an arms deal with the Philippines following a US senator\u2019s criticism of the human rights situation in the Philippines.\n\n\n\nThe President has been distancing from the US, recalling how former US President Barrack Obama supposedly looked down on him and the Philippines over unfounded human rights violations as well as criticisms over the administration's anti-illegal drugs campaign.\n\n\n\nHe also recalled the procurement of six US refurbished choppers used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), three of which already crashed and killed all the soldiers on board.\n\n\n\nDuterte also demanded the return of the Balangiga Bells, which were taken by the US as a war trophy.\n\n\n\n\u201cMemory still haunts everybody here because it was taken with a blood of war,\u201d he said.

The ruling party holds 68 seats to the now-dissolved CNRP\u2019s 55.\n\n\u201cWe had already passed the draft budget law with 65 voices on Friday, and the document explains what sectors are a priority, including education, health, the elections and social sectors,\u201d said National Assembly spokesman Leng Peng Long.\n\nPeng Long added that the assembly\u2019s 10 parliamentary committees will now each have two additional members, taking membership up to 11.\n\n\u201cBefore there were nine people, and sometimes one party did not come, another party did not have enough members to hold the meeting. [Now] even if there are absentees, we can continue the meetings,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder recently passed amendments to the Law on the Election of Members of the National Assembly, the CNRP\u2019s parliamentary seats will now be redistributed among six small parties \u2013 mostly to the royalist Funcinpec party, which pushed to have the CNRP dissolved."

    "text": "The Air Force just massed an amazing array of fire power. It just might have been in the wrong place.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2018, two U.S. Air Force wings in Utah launched thirty-five F-35 stealth fighters in a short span of time.\n\nThe air force lauded the display as evidence of America's overwhelming military might. At least one critic dismissed it as a publicity stunt.\n\nIn fact, there's one region where mass-takeoffs are an important military procedure: the Korean Peninsula. Ironically, that's the one region where the Trump administration is deliberately limiting the flying branch's authority to organize large-scale warplane-launches.\n\nThe November group-takeoff, which the air force calls an \"elephant walk,\" involved F-35As from the 388th and 419th Fighter Wings at Hill Air Force Base. The active-duty 388th and reserve 419th train air force F-35 pilots.\n\nThe 388th's 34th Fighter Squadron, whose F-35s have the latest Block 3F software, also has a front-line role. In late 2017, it became the first air force F-35 unit to deploy overseas, to Japan.\n\nAt the time of the elephant walk\u2014the first for the F-35\u2014the Utah wings possessed around forty F-35s. The wings are on track to receive a combined seventy-two F-35s by 2019.\n\nThe Hill stealth fighters took off one at a time in roughly 30-second intervals. In just a few minutes, the wings launched as many F-35 sorties as they normally do in a full day of routine training.\n\n\"Exercising with multiple squadrons of F-35s can demonstrate our ability to defeat potential adversaries wherever they may arise,\" Maj. Caleb Guthmann, the 34th Fighter Squadron's assistant director of operations, said in a statement.\n\nBut Valerie Insinna, a reporter for Defense News, echoed a more cynical sentiment when, on Twitter, she described the elephant walk as \"cool\" but \"very choreographed.\"\n\n\u201cCall me when they fix all the ALIS problems and then we'll talk,\u201d Insinna added, referring to the F-35's buggy Autonomic Logistics Information System, a computer network for the type's maintainers.\n\nIn a March 2018 congressional hearing, Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris, the air force's deputy chief of staff for plans, programs and requirements, said it cost around $50,000 to fly one F-35 for an hour. That's roughly twice what an F-16 costs for an hour in the air.\n\nIn fact, elephant walks significantly contribute to the readiness of American and allied squadrons in South Korea and nearby countries.\n\nIn the event of war with North Korea, U.S. and allied forces plan to quickly target the roughly 13,000 artillery pieces that Pyongyang has massed along the Korean demilitarized zone. In the early hours of a war, that artillery likely would bombard Seoul, which lies just 25 miles south of the DMZ.\n\n\"A serious, credible threat to 25 million [Republic of Korea] citizens and approximately 150,000 U.S. citizens living in the [Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area] is also posed from its long-range artillery,\" U.S. Army general Vincent Brooks, head of U.S. Forces Korea, told a U.S. Senate committee in March 2018.\n\nThe air force maintains three F-16 squadrons and an A-10 squadron in South Korea and two F-15 squadrons in Japan. Additional squadrons, almost certainly including F-35 units, would join them during a crisis. An air campaign targeting North Korea would require 2,000 sorties per day, U.S. military officials told Air Force magazine.\n\nBy comparison, the allied air war over Iraq and Kuwait in January 1991 averaged 1,200 strike sorties per day, according to statistics compiled by David Deptula, a former air force general who is now an analyst for the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Virginia. The U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria averaged just fifteen strikes per day, according to Deptula.\n\nThe roughly 100 U.S. F-16s and A-10s in South Korea and Japan\u2014and any F-35s that deployed in time for the first day of fighting\u2014likely would be the first to hit North Korean artillery. And they'd have to launch fast to save lives in Seoul.\n\nThere is a reason that the 7th Air Force in South Korea and Japan has organized more elephant walks than most air force commands have done. \"The threat here on the peninsula is very real, and countering that threat needs to be in the forefront of our minds,\" Col. William D. Betts, then-commander of the 51st Fighter Wing in South Korea, said in 2017.\n\nBut the Korea elephant walk is an endangered species. The 7th Air Force has conducted most of its mass-takeoffs, which require intensive planning and maintenance efforts, under the auspices of the annual Vigilante Ace exercise.\n\nIn 2018 the Trump administration suspended Vigilant Ace as a concession to North Korea, hoping that Pyongyang in turn would suspend its nuclear-weapons program. North Korea has continued to develop its nukes.\n\nThe air force organized elephant walks in South Korea in 2016 and 2017 but not in 2018. The suspension of large-scale exercises with South Korea hasn\u2019t created \"immediate\" concerns about combat-readiness, Pacific Air Forces commander Gen. Charles Brown said in November 2018. But it could cause \"difficulties\" if it continues.\n\nThere's nothing preventing air force squadrons that aren't in South Korea, including Hill's F-35 units, from practicing mass takeoffs. These same squadrons might deploy to the Korean Peninsula during wartime, in which case their elephant walks would amount to more than an expensive public relations exercise.\n\nThey'd be preparation for the kind of sudden, overwhelming violence a new Korean war would require.\n\nDavid Axe edits War Is Boring.

    "text": "Botswana purchased \u20ac304.2 million worth of military hardware from France in 2016, including MICA-VL and Mistral missiles.\n\nThis is according to the French Ministry for the Armed Forces 2017 report to Parliament on arms exports, published in July. Most of the money is believed to be from a contract with European missile manufacturer MBDA for MICA-VL and Mistral missiles. It has been reported that Botswana has been interested in these missiles for a time, and Botswana Defence Force (BDF) commander Lt Gen Galebotswe accompanied by Lt Col Mokgadi and Lt Col Motlaleng were in France in December 2015 for a demonstration of the missile systems.\n\nThe MICA-VL is a short range, ground based air defence system deploying the MICA fire-and-forget missile, capable of being fitted with either a heat-seeking homing head or with an active radar seeker head. Interception range is up to 20 km.\n\nThe Mistral man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) is a short range weapon using a fire-and-forget heat-seeking missile with a range of up to 6 km. It is normally operated by a gunner and a crew commander. However, if the mission is carried out in a simple tactical environment, it can be operated by one single soldier. Mistral entered series production in 1989 and over 16 000 missiles have been ordered by more than 27 countries.\n\nAs noted by ADIT \u2013 The Bulletin, the Mistral/MICA agreement is not the first defence deal between Botswana and France, as the BDF is a user of ACMAT (Ateliers de Construction M\u00e9canique de L\u2019Atlantique) vehicles. However, last year\u2019s contracts dwarf orders in previous years of \u20ac12 million in 2014 and just \u20ac0.1 million in 2015.\n\nAccording to the report, France delivered 14 missile launchers to Botswana in 2016. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Arms Transfer Database notes that Botswana bought 100 Strela-3/SA-14 surface-to-air missiles from the Ukraine in 2012.\n\nGaborone is believed to be negotiating with Sweden for between eight and 12 Gripen fighter jets to replace its CF-5 fighters, for an estimated cost of $1.7 billion. Other procurements include a $179 million deal for 45 Piranha 3 armoured vehicles from Swiss company GDELS-Mowag.\n\nBotswana is an important market for France. Paris granted 15 defence export licences in 2016, as compared to five the year before. The law enforcement sector is also an important market \u2013 Airbus Helicopters sold three AS350 B3e (now known as the H125) Ecureuil helicopters to the Police Air Support Branch in January 2015, which joined three already acquired in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in July this year it emerged that Botswana has purchased 500 second hand Land Rover 110 Defenders for P161 million (12.5 million pounds) from UK-based Witham Specialist Vehicles. Land Rover Jaguar ended the production of the Defender range and its spare parts in 2015. The BDF and the Botswana Police Services Special Support Group (SSG) still have large fleets of the Defender 110 which are used for troop transportation and operational support roles."

    "text": "According to romania-Insider website, US defense group Raytheon will deliver its latest Configuration 3+ of the Patriot air defense missile system to Romania, the one currently used by the US Army, according to Mike Ellison, country manager of Raytheon Romania, local News.ro reported.\n\n\n\nM901 launcher unit of Patriot air defense missile system at Paris Air Show in June 2009\n\nThe systems have new hardware and software components, added in 2017. The most modern/current variant of Patriot is called Patriot Configuration 3+, not PAC-3. PAC-3 is one of the missiles used by Configuration 3+, but as Patriot is an entire system, not just a missile, the Config 3+ enhancements involve a whole suite of upgrades and capabilities. One of them is enabling the system to take advantage of the PAC-3 MSE capabilities, but there are many other things, such as a better user interface and increased reliability, that Config 3+ has.\n\nMike Ellison, country manager of Raytheon Romania, said that Romanian specialists will contribute in the future to optimizing and modernizing this system. Some components of the Patriot systems, namely parts of the radar, may be produced in Romania, by local company Aerostar Bacau, Raytheon announced earlier this year. According to Ellison, the partnership between Romania and Raytheon has an important role in strengthening NATO\u2019s Eastern flank as Europe faces the biggest challenges since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Romania has already paid the first Patriot system, which has a cost of USD 910.1 million. The total cost of this program is USD 4.64 billion, VAT included.\n\nThe MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high performance radar systems. The Patriot system is modular and highly mobile. A battery-sized element can be emplaced in less than 1 hour. The latest version is the PAC-3. Due to miniaturization, a single canister can hold four PAC-3 missiles (as opposed to one PAC-2 missile per canister). The PAC-3 missile is also more maneuverable than previous variants, due to 180 tiny pulse solid propellant rocket motors mounted in the forebody of the missile (called Attitude Control Motors, or ACMs) which serve to fine align the missile trajectory with its target to achieve hit-to-kill capability. The PAC-3 can hit ballistic missile up to 20km."

    "text": "Covering politicians who constantly say stupid things while hoping that they will say a sensible thing in the future is a symptom of journalism in the age of extreme populism.\n\nInstead of treating every madcap utterance with surprise, it is time to make peace with the fact that, when speaking of science, Union \u2018science\u2019 minister Harsh Vardhan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi simply lack the competence to speak knowledgeably. They are not going to say sensible stuff in the future. It is time to stop covering each proclamation that \u201cthe Vedas said it all\u201d with a clarification that they did not. Everyone who has ever been willing to be persuaded otherwise has already been persuaded otherwise; the facts, as they say, are right there.\n\nJournalism has reason to value objectivity above all else but objectivity is not \u2018balance\u2019 in some mechanical sense; it is the capacity to evaluate a bit of information such that the evaluator can eliminate cognitive and intellectual biases from the evaluation. Not surprisingly, those who would end up on the wrong end of a truly objective evaluation are the ones who demand \u2018evenhandedness\u2019 and scream the loudest about bias when a report is not empathetic. Hence the popular perception that if a story quotes someone saying A is wrong, it must also include the voices of those who think A is right.\n\nYet even this demand for false balance goes out the window the moment a minister comes along to publicly proclaim that people flew airplanes 3,000 years ago and grafted elephant heads onto human bodies. There is no point in collecting quotations from those who believe the minister is right when objective methods of evaluation have established that the minister is wrong. This is not journalism\u2019s loss of objectivity because misconstrued objectivity was never journalism\u2019s purpose.\n\nIndeed, pretensions of objectivity would be downright unethical while reporting on a science minister\u2019s pseudoscientific claims on a stage meant for scientists, and the audience\u2019s quiet tolerance of his words.\n\nAny other country with aspirations akin to India\u2019s on the science front might have shunned a man as unhinged in his opinions of science as Harsh Vardhan, but he is protected in India by a culture that exalts, and sometimes makes excuses for, political and bureaucratic patronage. In a political culture fixated on hero worship, journalism should question his right \u2013 and those who afford him that right \u2013 to insult our intelligence and debase the endeavours of highly qualified men and women his ministry is responsible for supporting.\n\nThe man seems unstoppable \u2013 and it no longer seems fair for us to expect him to stop. At the 105th Indian Science Congress that kicked off in Imphal on Friday, Harsh Vardhan went on stage to say that Stephen Hawking had acknowledged that the Vedas might have \u201coffered a better theory\u201d than the mass-energy equivalence in Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity (the latter probably better known as the equation E = mc2).\n\nWhat Vardhan has said has no meaning. The Vedas could have offered a better theory for what exactly? E = mc2 is not a theory \u2013 it is a \u2018problem\u2019 that requires solving in contexts where the relationship between the variables as specified in the equation applies. More generally, E = mc2 is not the kind of solution Vardhan is hoping it could have been because it wasn\u2019t exclusively developed to resolve a germane problem. On the contrary, it was developed first, based on which humans invented challenges that the equation could help surmount.\n\nIt is also funny that Vardhan\u2019s celebration of the Vedas as an instrument with which to claim historic primacy and superiority directly contradicts the manner in which the minister sought to use a scientist from the very West that he and his parivar deride as a crutch for his nonsensical claim.\n\nFinally, Hawking himself has never acknowledged that \u201cthe Vedas are better\u201d (Update, March 18: a member of the Stephen Hawking Foundation\u2019s governance panel has attested to this). The source of Vardhan\u2019s claims has been tracked to a Facebook page run by a user whose display name is Stephen Hawking, with a note that provides no sources for its contents. Additionally, in claiming what he did, Vardhan has also insulted the memory of Hawking, a staunch atheist and rationalist wholly antithetical to the idea of mixing religion and politics.\n\nWhat doing science means\n\nHarsh Vardhan\u2019s recklessly utilitarian conception of science \u2013 in which the only question he wants us to ask is \u201cWhat good is this to me?\u201d \u2013 has no space for science\u2019s non-functional value.\n\nHe and his government believe that when 0.8% of the country\u2019s GDP is being channeled into R&D, it is possible to ensure all of it is further channeled only into translational and/or technologisable outcomes by tweaking scholarship policies, tugging on higher-education infrastructure development and by announcements of intent. It is likely that the government is not stopping to think about whether science itself can work that way.\n\nIt can\u2019t. It will stall, splutter, choke on itself and blow up \u2013 particularly in a growth-minded country like India.\n\nIf Einstein had to be wondering about relativity just so he could make the world a better place, he might not have bothered with the question in the first place. But today, the mass-energy equivalence informs everything from nuclear power to manufacturing semiconductors.\n\nIt is also important that Einstein had to be selfish, self-absorbed, even privileged to some extent. No good can come of vilifying these attributes when it is clear to everyone that, with one\u2019s heart in the right place, enormous \u201cvalue\u201d can be created. But no, Vardhan and the administration to which he belongs have only displayed a lack of trust in the morality of India\u2019s scientists. Instead of letting science be what each scientist wants to achieve with its rules and apparatuses, with stringent quality control, accountability and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 an equitable vision for scientific research in the country, the government has been attempting to homogenise everyone\u2019s vision of science in the image of its own. And if you don\u2019t like it, too bad.\n\nThis is not going to end well. The moment is already upon us when reacting from strength of insight instead of from fear of criticism \u2013 to adapt Jay Rosen\u2019s criticism of the Times \u2013 is no longer an option. If not, we might as well all go to hell. Or whatever the Vedic equivalent of it is."

IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly quoted Mohamed Emad el-Kabbany, MSPV\u2019s assistant manager for sales and business development, as saying that Egypt is receiving between 2 000 and 3 000 Panthera T6s for its police and army.\n\nHe added that Egyptian company Eagles Defence International Systems (EDIS) is the company\u2019s Egyptian agent \u2013 in 2014 it was reported that EDIS was producing the Panthera T6, as well as the larger S10 and K10CMD.\n\nThe Panthera T6 was first seen in May 2014 during an Egyptian military parade and subsequently seen in the Sinai Peninsula. At least some have been fitted with electronic warfare equipment for use in the Sinai.\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its Arms Transfers Database, lists 50 Panthera T6s being ordered from the UAE in 2013, with deliveries from 2014-2015.\n\nAccordign to MSPV, the Panthera T6 is powered by a 4 litre V6 petrol engine driving all four wheels through a five speed manual transmission. It seats two plus six, although other seating arrangements are available. Features include air conditioning, a remote controlled roof mounted search light and camera, optional gun ports and hatches.\n\nThe Panthera T6 is based on the Toyota Land Cruiser 79-series chassis. An optional mount on the roof can accommodate a machinegun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibya has apparently taken delivery of Panthera T6s donated by the United Arab Emirates. They were delivered in April 2016. The Panthera T6 was seen several times in March 2015 in use by the Libyan National Army. In September last year Indian security forces introduced the vehicle into service, particularly for security in Jammu and Kashmir."

This also marks the first time these rockets will be used on the A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft or similar turboprop platforms.\n\nAccording to the Lebanese army official website, \u201cthis is the first batch of the rockets that will be delivered successively to the LAF.\u201d\n\nIn a previous interview during the Manama Air Power Symposium last November, Commander of the Lebanese Air Force Brigadier General Ziad Haykal said the close air support jets give an additive value to the LAF capabilities not previously found in the national air force.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is the complementarity between the A-29 Super Tucano aircraft and other air force operational arms,\u201d Haykal said. \u201cWe are facing a new integration rule and operational paths, especially because these aircrafts will not operate alone but alongside other aircraft.\u201d\n\nHaykal stressed the importance of the U.S. military aid program to Lebanon, which is the framework used for delivery of the six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. is the primary supplier of military equipment to Lebanon,\u201d he said. \u201cThe aid has made the difference in our battle against terrorists.\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 13 statement, the U.S. embassy in Lebanon said the delivery demonstrates the U.S. government\u2019s firm and steady commitment of support to the Lebanese Armed Forces in their capacity as the sole, legitimate defender of Lebanon.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

The type has an overall length of 27 meters, a top speed in excess of 40 knots, and displaces approximately 50 tonnes. It has a range of over 1 000 nautical miles at 10 knots. The type can be armed with 20, 23, 25 or 30 mm cannons, 7.62 or 12.7 mm machineguns and 40 mm grenade launchers. These can be mounted on automatic turrets or manually aimed. Missiles can also be fitted. Accommodation provides for 12 crewmembers.\n\nThe Super Dvora MK 3 can be propelled by articulating surface drives (ASD) or waterjets. The ASD system enables operation in extremely shallow water at minimal drafts of 1.2 metres. The ASD system is also highly manoeuvrable, steering the craft with thrust vectoring.\n\nAngola\u2019s most recent budget also makes provision for the acquisition of six transport helicopters for $52 million and budgets $9.5 million for maritime patrol vessels. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute\u2019s Arms Transfers database, in 2016 Angola ordered several patrol vessels from France as part of a 495 million euro deal, but not much is known about this deal.\n\nIn 2016 Angola ordered two fast patrol craft from Whitehead Sistemi Subacquei for around 7 million euros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngola has already taken delivery of a number of helicopters over the last decade, including four A109K and two AW139 helicopters from AgustaWestland (Leonardo Helicopters) for use by the Navy; eight Mi-171Sh armed transport helicopters from Russia and 12 second hand and upgraded Mi-24P/Mi-35P attack helicopters from Russia.\n\n"

    "text": "Canada's multi-billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia includes a substantial number of \"heavy assault\" armoured vehicles and a maintenance deal that would see the Ontario-based manufacturer embed teams at multiple locations throughout the kingdom.\n\nCBC News has obtained documents that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 lay out the major elements of the original agreement signed in early 2014 and approved by the previous Conservative government.\n\nThe $15 billion agreement was given the further blessing of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in the spring of 2016 when it began issuing permits for the export of the combat vehicles.\n\nMuch of the heated public debate about the arms sale has taken place in a vacuum because specific details of General Dynamics Land Systems Canada's (GDLS) contract were sealed under a confidentiality agreement demanded by the Saudi government.\n\nBoth the Liberals and Conservatives have used the absence of details to downplay the destructive firepower of the vehicles being sold.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper once described them as \"trucks.\" Before the last election, Trudeau called them \"jeeps.\"\n\nCBC News has obtained internal records that show the deal struck in February 2014 involved 928 of the most modern light armoured vehicles, known as the LAV 6.\n\nOf those, almost 40 per cent \u2014 354 \u2014 are standard troop carriers.\n\nThe order also includes 119 LAV 6 vehicles of the \"heavy assault\" type, with powerful 105 millimetre canons affixed to their turrets, which were still under development at the time the documents were written.\n\nAnother 119 are configured as \"anti-tank\" vehicles and a further 119 are designated as \"direct fire\" support, with a two-man turret and 30 millimetre chain gun.\n\nThe remaining vehicles include ambulances, mobile command posts, VIP transports and recovery vehicles equipped with cranes.\n\nSaudis want details kept quiet\n\nThere has been talk in the defence industry that some details of the order have been modified over the last four years, and that it's possible fewer vehicles may be sold.\n\nThe company was asked to comment on the documents and the current status of the deal.\n\n\"General Dynamics declines to comment due to contractual and confidentiality reasons,\" said Doug Wilson-Hodge, manager of corporate affairs at General Dynamics Land Systems.\n\nDelivery of the first vehicles was slated to begin in early 2017, according to internal Global Affairs Canada emails obtained by CBC News under access to information legislation.\n\nThese are combat-ready vehicles ... certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were. - Cesar Jaramillo, Project Ploughshares\n\nThe government agency that brokered the deal \u2014 the Canadian Commercial Corporation \u2014 also refused to discuss the documents.\n\n\"All details of the contract remain commercially confidential,\" said an unsigned email from the agency.\n\n\"Further, the documents you mention below are not internal to CCC nor the Government of Canada, therefore, we decline to comment.\"\n\nInternal government emails, obtained in 2015 by The Globe and Mail, show the Saudis stipulated that releasing the details of the deal would amount to \"breaking the terms of the contract.\"\n\nStephen Harper personally reassured the late Saudi King Abdullah, in writing, that Ottawa would hold up its end of the bargain, the newspaper reported.\n\nDeal includes 14-year support program\n\nDefence experts and human rights advocates, particularly those who have fought the deal, said the documents represent the first clear snapshot the Canadian public has seen of what the government is allowing to be exported.\n\n\"These documents raise very important questions and I think our understanding of what was announced in 2014 has to change, needs to change,\" said Cesar Jaramillo, the executive director of Project Ploughshares.\n\n\"This shows us that these are combat-ready vehicles and certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were.\"\n\nA Southern People's Resistance militant loyal to Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi mans an anti-aircraft machine gun the militia seized from the army in al-Habilin, in Yemen's southern province of Lahej, March 22, 2015. There are concerns among human rights groups that the Saudis could use Canadian-made armoured vehicles against Houthi fighters in Yemen. (Nabeel Quaiti/Reuters)\n\nThe records obtained by CBC News show the contract between London, Ont.-based GDLS and the Saudis goes much deeper than just than just selling the vehicles.\n\nIt also involves a 14-year support program that covers ammunition, crew \"training in Canada/Europe\" and \"embedded\" maintenance, with a fleet management team in 13 workshops.\n\nThe reference to Europe has to do with training Saudi crews on the gun system, slated to take place in France.\n\nThe service agreement in Saudi Arabia would be delivered through a subsidiary of the Canadian manufacturer located in Riyadh, said the documents obtained by CBC News.\n\nThe support deal is significant on a couple of different levels, said Dave Perry, an expert in defence procurement at the Canadian Institute of Global Affairs.\n\nFor starters, it partly explains the enormous price tag. Most of the value in defence deals today is not in the hardware, but in the long-term maintenance and support services being provided, said Perry.\n\nIt could give Canada \"a fairly significant amount of leverage\" going forward, he added, pointing out that the support deal could be used to apply diplomatic pressure in the event Canada has new concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"If we are simply selling them a piece of equipment and walking away, you don't really have much recourse afterwards to do anything, if they do something that you don't want,\" he said.\n\nRe-examining arms exports\n\nLast summer, images surfaced online that showed Canadian-made armoured vehicles, manufactured by another company, being used by the Saudi state in its long-running conflict against the Shiite population in Qatif, a restive portion of eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of the video clips also showed a light armoured vehicle, apparently manufactured by GDLS, operating in the region of Awamiyah.\n\nThe Liberal government launched an investigation, which ended with \"no conclusive evidence that Canadian made vehicles were used in human rights violations.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland supported the findings, but told a House of Commons committee a few weeks ago that the review caused her to re-examine the arms export system.\n\nAt the same time, the Liberal government introduced amendments to Bill C-47, which allows Canada to join the global arms trade treaty. The changes would, when passed, give the federal cabinet broader powers to deny export permits if there is the \"substantial risk\" of human rights violations.\n\nReleasing the report\n\nFreeland has shown no appetite to revisit the Saudi deal.\n\n\"Let's be clear, from this day forward, I want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard on the export of controlled goods from Canada,\" Freeland said. \"On a matter of principle, Canada will honour, to the greatest extent possible, pre-existing contracts. We can all understand and appreciate the fundamental importance of being able to trust Canada.\"\n\nOfficials in Freeland's office would not answer questions directly related to the leaked documents on Monday. Instead, a spokesman pointed to the ongoing debate over over Bill C-47.\n\n\"We are committed to a new and higher standard for arms exports,\" Adam Austin said in an email.\n\nJaramillo said it would be in the public's interest for the Liberals to release a copy of their recent investigation and to explain how they came to the conclusion that no abuse took place in eastern Saudi Arabia involving Canadian vehicles.\n\nReleasing that investigation report, he said, shouldn't have any effect on the current sale.\n\n\"Before they invoke commercial confidentiality, to shield the Canadian public from this important information, I just want to point out that I don't see how an independent government investigation into human rights violations would interfere at all with the commercial confidentiality of GDLS,\" he said."

    "text": "India\u2019s Goa Shipyards Limited has formally handed over the CGS Valiant patrol vessel to Mauritius, which is expected to reach the island nation in June after sailing from India.\n\nThe Mauritius Police Force said the CGS Valiant was handed over on 1 May in India, although Goa Shipyards Limited (GSL) said it was handed over on 30 April by Rear Admiral Shekhar Mital, head of GSL, to K Jhugroo, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mauritius Police Force.\n\nMital said the contract was signed on 17 May 2014 and the keel laid on 22 may 2015, with the launch taking place on 2 February 2017. \u201cWe have successfully delivered this ship four months ahead of contractual schedule of August 2017, within 23 months of keel laying which is a record in itself,\u201d Mital said.\n\nThe 50 metre long CGS Valiant is designed for coastal patrols, anti-piracy, search and rescue and counter smuggling and drug missions. It is fitted with a 30 mm CRN-91 cannon, 12.7 mm heavy machineguns and 7.62 mm machineguns. It has a top speed of 37 knots and endurance of seven days. It is powered by three MTU-F 16V4000 M90 diesel engines that drive three KAMEWA Type-71SII waterjets.\n\nCGS Valiant is the second of two fast patrol vessels ordered from GSL, with CGS Victory having been handed over to the Mauritius National Coast Guard (NCG) in September 2016. The India Import-Export Bank helped fund the $41 million order.\n\nMauritius in December last year commissioned into service CGS Victory as well as two Chetak helicopters from India for its Police Helicopter Squadron. The two refurbished helicopters were donated by the Indian government in line with India\u2019s commitment to augment the capacities of the Mauritius Police Force, including in the critical area of search and rescue.\n\nIn March last year the island nation strengthened its maritime capabilities with the commissioning of ten 14.5 metre Fast Interceptor Boats (FIBs) from GSL. The bulk of the FIBs will be used to conduct day and night patrols and periodic Special Forces Operations (SFOs) in shallow waters. Each boat has a top speed of 35 knots with a cruising speed of 20 knots, along with an endurance of over 200 km. The boats were ordered along with machineguns, ammunition and body armour for the crews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mauritius National Coast Guard on 14 July last year inducted a third Do 228 aircraft into service to patrol the nation\u2019s coastline."

    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp's foundation, the company's largest shareholder, pledged to work with unions and management to appoint a successor to its chairman Ulrich Lehner.\n\nThyssenkrupp has been gradually dismantling its complex submarines-to-elevators business and last month merged its European steel assets with those of rival Tata, further retreating from a core business.\n\nShareholders are pushing for a radical overhaul, urging the Essen, Germany-based conglomerate to consider selling its elevators business and materials services division, which distributes non-ferrous metals, alloys and stainless steel.\n\nMajor restructuring moves have been opposed by workers and Thyssenkrupp's management. The company employs 158,000 in businesses ranging from food packaging to naval vessels and industrial services.\n\nBelow are stakeholders with the power to influence Thyssenkrupp's fate:\n\nALFRIED KRUPP VON BOHLEN AND HALBACH FOUNDATION\n\nThe foundation is Thyssenkrupp's biggest shareholder with a 21 percent stake. It has 11 members and is headed by Ursula Gather, rector of the University of Dortmund, who also sits on the Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board.\n\nThe foundation is tasked with preserving the \"unity\" of Thyssenkrupp and uses proceeds from Thyssenkrupp's dividend payments to further good causes in science and education.\n\nThe foundation was set up after former chief executive Berthold Beitz persuaded the last member of the Krupp family, Arndt von Bohlen, to put the family shareholding into a foundation tasked with promoting the common good.\n\nCritics say that the unity of the conglomerate has long been compromised with the sale of VDM Group, Steel Americas and the merger of European steel assets with Tata.\n\nThe foundation on Tuesday reiterated it will work with labour representatives and the company's management to develop a long-term strategy for the conglomerate.\n\nGerman newspaper Handelsblatt reported at the weekend that Gather had held talks with the largest shareholder of Kone on a potential merger of the two companies' elevator businesses.\n\nThe first conversations took place as early as two years ago but the idea was rebuffed by Hiesinger, who wanted to hold on to Thyssenkrupp's most profitable division, Handelsblatt reported.\n\nCEVIAN\n\nSwedish activist investor Cevian holds an 18 percent stake in Thyssenkrupp.\n\nLars Foerberg, founding partner of Cevian Capital, on Tuesday said: \"All great and enduring companies renew themselves, taking advantage of their strengths while adapting to new challenges and opportunities. As a large and long-term owner of Thyssenkrupp, Cevian Capital looks forward to supporting the company in achieving these objectives for the benefit of all Thyssenkrupp stakeholders.\"\n\nHe had renewed his call for deeper restructuring efforts a day after Thyssen struck its steel deal with Tata.\n\n\"There is now an urgent need and opportunity to address the significant and persistent underperformance of the industrial businesses,\" he said on July 1, adding that Thyssenkrupp could be valued at the equivalent of 50 euros ($58.5) per share.\n\nWORKERS\n\nUnions hold half the seats on Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board and any deal depends on their support, which Thyssenkrupp has so far won through major concessions regarding job guarantees and a pledge not to close factories. Together with representatives from the Krupp foundation, they have the power to block major strategic moves.\n\nWilhelm Segerath, head of the Thyssenkrupp works council and a senior official in the IG Metall industrial trade union, on Monday said he regretted the departure of Lehner but understood his move.\n\nELLIOTT\n\nThe U.S. activist investor has said it sees \"significant scope for operational improvement\" at Thyssenkrupp.\n\nElliott has a stake of below 3 percent according to its latest filing. It declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nCHAIRMAN ULRICH LEHNER\n\nThyssenkrupp's chairman resigned late on Monday, with his departure effective at the end of the month. Lehner signalled that there had been a clash with not just activist shareholders, but also with the Krupp foundation.\n\n\"The confidence of the major shareholders and a joint understanding within the Supervisory Board on the strategic direction of Thyssenkrupp were the basis for my work and a pre-requisite for my promise to Berthold Beitz to successfully further develop the company in the interest of customers, employees and shareholders. This is now no longer given,\" Lehner said in a statement late on Monday.\n\n\"I take this step consciously to enable a fundamental discussion with our shareholders on the future of Thyssenkrupp. My decision may contribute to creating the necessary awareness with all concerned parties that a break-up of the company and the related loss of many jobs is not an option - neither in the interest of the founder, nor in the interest of the country.\"\n\nLehner's remarks echoed a similar statement from former Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger on July 5, when he resigned, saying a \"joint understanding of board and supervisory board on the strategic direction of a company is a key pre-requisite for successfully leading a company\".\n\n($1 = 0.8551 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Tom Kaeckenhoff in Duesseldorf, Arno Schuetze and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; editing by Louise Heavens/Keith Weir)"

    "text": "LONDON \u2014 Britain needs to raise defense spending by over \u00a38 billion a year, or U.S. $10.59 billion, to not undermine the military relationship with the U.S. says a report by the parliamentary defence committee.\n\nThe report, which looks at the U.K.\u2019s defense relations with the U.S. and NATO, recommends Britain increases the percentage of gross domestic product being allocated to the military first to 2.5 percent and eventually 3 percent if the country is to maintain the military relationship with the U.S. and keep its leading role in NATO.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. armed forces and the Treasury benefit from our close relationship with the U.S. However, that will continue to be true only while the U.K. military retains both the capacity and capability to maintain interoperability with the U.S. military and to relieve U.S. burdens. For this to be the case the U.K. armed forces must be funded appropriately,\u201d said the report released June 26.\n\nThe lawmakers urged a significant rise in a defense budget which currently just manages to squeeze above the 2 percent of gross domestic product demanded by NATO for defense spending.\n\nExcluded from cooperative plans in Europe, UK sets groundwork for future fighters Left out in the cold by a joint Franco-German plan to develop a new fighter, British officials have been working for months on a combat air strategy to sustain Britain\u2019s capabilities beyond the Eurofighter Typhoon, and they are determined to figure out a way forward this summer.\n\n\u201cWe calculate that raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP would result in a forecast spend of \u00a350 billion per annum and raising it to 3% of GDP would take this to \u00a360 billion per annum,\u201d said the lawmakers.\n\nThe defense budget this year is set at \u00a337 billion with small real term increases expected annually up to 2022.\n\nA rise to 3 percent would see defence spending return to a level \u2014 in GDP percentage terms \u2014 that has not been seen since 1995.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe release of the document comes at a bad time for anyone advocating increases in defense spending here.\n\nLast week Chancellor Philip Hammond, an ex-defense secretary, revealed plans to spend an additional \u00a320 billion a year on health care and made it clear that there was little or nothing left to bolster the finances of other departments, including defense.\n\nDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson has been battling for months to secure additional funding to fill a black hole that the National Audit Office, the government\u2019s financial watchdog, has previously estimated could be anything between \u00a34.8 billion and \u00a320 billion in equipment spending alone over the next decade.\n\nThe exact amount depends to some degree on how much the military can save in efficiency improvements and reprioritizing and cutting capabilities and programs.\n\nThe headline outcomes of a Minstry of Defence review into the future size and shape of British forces, officially called the Modernising Defence Programme, could come at the NATO summit scheduled for Brussels starting July 11.\n\nMedia reports Sunday on the defense funding battle highlighted the seemingly growing rift between Williamson and senior government figures over the issue.\n\nThe reports followed strong denials from Prime Minister Theresa May last week that the government here was considering a watering down of Britain\u2019s \u2018tier-one\u2019 status as a military power after the Financial Times reported that May asked Williamson to justify continuance of that position.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, right, speaks to a group of soldiers of the NATO Battle Group at the Tapa military base in Estonia on Sept. 29, 2017. She was guaranteeing Britain's security commitment to the other 27 European Union leaders. (Marko Mumm/AP)\n\nThe U.S, Britain, China, Russia and France are the only nations with a tier one status \u2014 which basically means they are able to fight nuclear, conventional and other conflicts around the world.\n\nThe committee said military-to-military engagement between the U.K. and the U.S. was one of the linchpins of the bilateral relationship between the two nations.\n\nThe report said the U.K. benefits greatly from the width and depth of the U.K.-U.S. defense and security relationship, but such a relationship requires a degree of interoperability that can be sustained only through investment in U.K. armed forces.\n\nThe importance of the military relationship between the U.S. and Europe\u2019s leading military power also extends into NATO.\n\nLawmakers said the relationship is vital to the functioning of NATO while the U.K.\u2019s leading contribution to the alliance helps to sustain the relationship between London and Washington.\n\nJulian Lewis, the Defence Committee chairman, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cDefence spending is an area where a strong message needs to be sent to our allies and adversaries alike. The Government has consistently talked about increasing the U.K.\u2019s commitment to NATO after our departure from the European Union. An increased commitment, in the face of new and intensified threats, means that further investment is essential,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nThe warning in the report over the risks to the military relationship between London and Washington follows a similar warning in February by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis that Britain had to retain a credible military if the relationship between the two nations was to endure and strengthen.\n\nWilliamson said that in financial terms alone the U.K. benefits to the tune of \u00a33 billion a year from the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship.\n\nJohn Spellar MP, the Defence Committee\u2019s senior Labour Party member and former armed forces minister said the inquiry has \u201cunderlined the importance of the U.K.-U.S. relationship in the area of defense and security and emphasizes the benefit which the U.K. receives as a result.\u201d"

    "text": "The government must lift the ban on media access and ensure that the repatriation of refugees is acceptable to the international community.\n\nBy SITHU AUNG MYINT | FRONTIERWHEN THE National League for Democracy government took office in March 2016, there was intense interest in its plans for developing the economy.State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi decided that economic development depended on ending decades of civil war and made the pursuit of peace the government\u2019s top priority, a cause to which she has devoted much time and energy.The NLD government\u2019s efforts to attract foreign investment, which included legislative reforms, received a boost when the United States lifted all remaining economic sanctions against Myanmar in September 2016. The next month, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army launched the first of a coordinated series of attacks on security posts in northern Rakhine State.They were followed by another series of attacks last August, which led to a massive military counter-insurgency operation that triggered the exodus of more than 688,000 Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh. Many Myanmar initially believed that conflict and violence in a remote corner of the country was unlikely to have a negative impact on economic development, but it is now clear they were wrong. This week I\u2019d like to discuss the adverse effects of the Rakhine crisis on the economy.In a shock decision on February 1, Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose, the Myanmar affiliate of a New York-based law firm, announced that it was closing its Yangon office at the end of the month. In 2013, it became the first American law firm to open for business in Myanmar amid the high expectations for economic growth fuelled by foreign investment after the country began its transition to democracy in 2011.HRMR\u2019s lead director, Mr Eric Rose, was quoted as saying there were three main reasons that influenced the decision to close shop in Myanmar. In lengthy interviews withand, he cited government inaction on the economy, the Rakhine crisis, and remaining US financial sanctions together with the suspension of the European Union-Myanmar investment protection agreement.It is clear that economic development has been adversely affected by the situation in Rakhine. Rose said the Rakhine crisis, particularly the flight of more than 750,000 refugees, had created a reputational risk that deterred Western companies from investing in Myanmar. The risk was \u201cin particular due to the lack of a coherent response from the Myanmar government\u201d to the situation in Rakhine, he toldThe Rakhine crisis is not only a border problem, a religious and ethnic problem, a human rights problem and a sovereignty problem, but a problem that is directly related to economic development. That it was a factor in the decision to close the Herzfeld Rubin Meyer & Rose office after five years is an indication of the importance of solving the Rakhine problem.What needs to be done to address the problem that has attracted intense domestic and international interest?Media coverage of the violence in northern Rakhine after the August attacks last year has had a negative effect on Myanmar\u2019s international image. It has included accounts of atrocities against Muslims and the burning of their homes to drive them out of the country.Initially, the government and the Tatmadaw denied allegations of human rights abuses during the counter-insurgency operation. Then news emerged of the massacre at Inn Din village in Maungdaw Township on September 2 last year. An exhaustive account of the Inn Din massacre published byon February 8 included interviews with Buddhist villagers who admitted torching Muslim homes, burying bodies and killing Muslims.The report also included the accounts by security personnel of their role in an operation to drive Muslims from the village.said it was the first time soldiers and paramilitary police were implicated by testimony from other security personnel.A week before the Reuters investigation was published,reported that there were at least five mass graves containing the bodies of Muslims at Gu Dar Pyin village in Buthidaung Township. The report said that before victims were thrown into mass graves, acid was poured on their faces to prevent them from being identified.On February 2, the government denied the report, saying a clash at the village on August 27 last year had resulted in the deaths of 19 \u201cterrorists\u201d who had been \u201ccarefully buried\u201d by the security forces. The Rakhine State government threatened to suewhich said it stood by its reporting.On media coverage, there is only one way forward. The ban on media access to northern Rakhine must be lifted so that the international community may learn the truth about what happened during the counter-insurgency operation launched after the August 25 attacks.The Annan commission on Rakhine recommended \u201cfull and regular\u201d media access, saying that the ban was counterproductive. Media access has also been urged by former Thai foreign minister, Mr Surakiart Sathirathai, who heads a board appointed by the government to advise the committee formed to implement the Annan commission recommendations.Another important issue is the repatriation and resettlement of refugees, which must be accomplished successfully, no matter how many difficulties need to be overcome. Muslims should be resettled where they had lived before they fled Myanmar and be able to live without fear.The repatriation process must be conducted in a way that is acceptable to the international community. Otherwise, the Rakhine problem will continue to hinder economic development in Myanmar.who are they ?"

    "text": "The new chief for research in the Pentagon is building an artificial intelligence center, pushing for self-driving vehicles in combat zones and more powerful lasers, and says solving the hypersonic gap means updating testing facilities.\n\nDefense Undersecretary for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin testified before the House Armed Services Committee last week, answering questions on a range of gear and procurement questions.\n\nBut those most relevant to service members included weapons systems on the horizon that troops could see in combat with near peer adversaries.\n\nThese two Army BCTs will be the first to put robotic vehicles in their formations The autonomous ground vehicle is meant to be capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds of gear over 60 miles in 72 hours.\n\nMore rapid development will include the use of unmanned ground vehicles in formations.\n\nThe Army recently announced the 10th Mountain Division and the 101st Airborne Division will have a robotic combat vehicle called the Squad Multipurpose Equipment Transport in the ranks this year for testing, which will develop the likely full-fielding gear mule-type robot.\n\nSimple tasks, such as delivering food, mail, water and fuel, could be automated sooner than some think, Griffin said.\n\n\u201cI think, frankly, we\u2019re going to have self-driving vehicles in theater for the Army before we\u2019ll have self-driving cars on the streets,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIf that can be done by an automated unmanned vehicle with a relatively simple AI driving algorithm where I don\u2019t have to worry about pedestrians and road signs and all of that, why wouldn\u2019t I do that?\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Transitioning out of the service? Sign up for the Rebootcamp Newsletter to receive helpful information on education, employment and entrepreneurship. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Rebootcamp Newsletter.\n\nGriffin pointed to Chinese systems that have been fielded or can be soon fielded that can launch a strike and reach out \u201cthousands of kilometers\u201d from the Chinese shore and \u201chold our carrier battle groups or forward deployed forces on land\u201d at risk.\n\n\u201cWe, today, do not have systems which can hold them at risk in a corresponding manner, and we don\u2019t have defenses against those systems,\u201d Griffin told the House Armed Services Committee members on April 18.\n\nAnother Chinese technology threat includes the nation\u2019s development of swarm drone technologies to counter U.S. airpower and other strengths.\n\nThat means getting powerful laser systems up to snuff. But it won\u2019t happen tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe need to have 100-kilowatt-class weapons on Army theater vehicles. We need to have 300-kilowatt-class weapons on Air Force tankers,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe need to have megawatt-class directed energy weapons in space for space defense. These are things we can do over the next decade if we can maintain our focus.\u201d\n\nScientists he\u2019s been talking with have told him that level of laser power is five to six years away and a \u201cmegawatt laser\u201d is within a decade with persistent investment.\n\n\u2018An unacceptable situation\u2019\n\n\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., pointed out that the testing facilities, such as White Sands Missile Range in his state, have scarcely seen any upgrades or improvements in the past two decades, despite leaps in technology for missiles, lasers and other items.\n\nGriffin agreed, saying at a low estimate at least 20 such testing facilities across the nation are in the same situation.\n\nHe said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency does most of the leading-edge work on hypersonic missile systems and they have exactly one testing facility, a NASA wind tunnel near Langley, Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis is an unacceptable situation,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nHe promised to return with budget requests to renovate those facilities to improve testing.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., asked about a new area of focus that has broad-reaching effects: artificial intelligence.\n\nGriffin oversees the creation of a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that would create AI solutions for all the service branches.\n\nHe deferred on the details but told members that he expected to return with a plan within two months.\n\n\u201cWe owe the Congress a report, I think, about two months from now on what our A.I. strategy will be. And the JAIC, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, will be a part of that overall strategy,\u201d Griffin said."

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has halted delivery of equipment related to the stealthy F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey, marking the first concrete U.S. step to block delivery of the jet to the NATO ally in light of Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.\n\nU.S. officials told their Turkish counterparts they will not receive further shipments of F-35 related equipment needed to prepare for the arrival of the stealthy jet, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed the Reuters report that the equipment delivery had been stopped.\n\n\u201cPending an unequivocal Turkish decision to forgo delivery of the S-400, deliveries and activities associated with the stand-up of Turkey\u2019s F-35 operational capability have been suspended,\u201d Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews, a Defense Department spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system that the United States has said would compromise the security of F-35 aircraft.\n\nThe disagreement over the F-35 is the latest of a series of diplomatic disputes between the United States and Turkey including Turkish demands that the United States extradite Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, differences over Middle East policy and the war in Syria, and sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the next shipment of training equipment, and all subsequent shipments of F-35 related material, had been canceled. The aircraft is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.\n\nA Pentagon official had told Reuters in March that the United States had a number of items it could withhold in order to send Turkey a signal that the United States was serious about Ankara dropping its ambition to own the S-400.\n\nTurkish officials in Ankara were not immediately available for comment. Turkey has said it will take delivery of the S-400s in July.\n\nNATO SUMMIT\n\nThe U.S. decision on the F-35s was expected to complicate Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu\u2019s visit to Washington this week for a NATO summit. On Sunday, Erdogan suffered one of his biggest electoral losses in decades in local elections.\n\n\u201cCertain Russian weapon systems are seen as inherently threatening to the United States regardless of who is operating them and for what purpose,\u201d Andrew Hunter, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\n\u201cBecause Turkey is not just an F-35 purchaser, but an industrial partner, blocking delivery of these systems represents a major escalation by the United States as it threatens to impose serious costs on both sides,\u201d Hunter said.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nReuters reported last week that Washington was exploring whether it could remove Turkey from production of the F-35. Turkey makes parts of the fuselage, landing gear and cockpit displays. Sources familiar with the F-35\u2019s intricate worldwide production process and U.S. thinking on the issue last week said Turkey\u2019s role can be replaced.\n\nThe United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the Russian S-400 missile system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.\n\nIn an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.\n\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\n\nTurkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.\n\nTurkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar in March said that despite some issues, Turkish pilots were continuing their training at an air base in Arizona on the F-35, each of which costs $90 million, and that Ankara was expecting the aircraft to arrive in Turkey in November.\n\nBy halting jet deliveries, the Pentagon could subsequently delay training of Turkish pilots. Two additional jets are scheduled to arrive in Arizona in April and a significant delay could impact Turkey\u2019s November target date for operations.\n\nU.S. lawmakers also have expressed alarm over Turkey\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system. Four U.S. senators last week introduced a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the transfer of F-35s to Turkey until the U.S. government certifies that Ankara will not take delivery of the S-400 system.\n\nFollowing news of the halt, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, one of the bill sponsors, said she was glad to hear the administration was \u201cto delay the transfer of F-35 equipment to Turkey to help ensure U.S. military technology and capabilities cannot fall into the hands of the Kremlin.\u201d"

The operation\u2019s goal was to capture Bhindranwale. It escalated. Bhindranwale and many Sikhs were killed.\n\nThis caused widespread outrage among India\u2019s Sikh community. Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, both members of the Indian Intelligence Bureau\u2019s special task force for the protection of the prime minister, plotted revenge. They were armed with a 1A machine carbine and a .38-caliber revolver.\n\nGandhi was shot as she walked through the garden of her residence in New Delhi en route to a television interview with Peter Ustinov. As she approached a gate guarded by the two bodyguards, Beant Singh stepped forward and fired three rounds from his .38, hitting Gandhi in the abdomen. Satwant Singh then emptied his 1A\u2019s entire 30-round magazine into the prime minister.\n\nAt top \u2014 a 1A submachine gun. Above \u2014 Indira Gandhi. Photos via the author\n\nThe 1A is an Indian copy of the British L2A3/Mk4 Sterling submachine gun. Sterling agreed a production license with India in the early 1960s, signing a contract worth \u00a316,000 to produce the first 60,000 guns and provide the technical drawings and tooling for India to manufacture the weapons. Over the last 50 years India\u2019 small arms factories have produced around a million 1A machine carbines \u2014 many more than even Sterling produced.\n\nThe prime minister reportedly died almost instantly, although other sources suggest she died later in hospital. Her assassins threw down their guns and were arrested. They were taken to a guardroom, where in an ensuing struggle for one of their captor\u2019s weapons, Beant Singh was killed by a burst of fire from another Indian-made Sterling.\n\nIn the wake of the assassination India was swept by a wave of anti-Sikh riots. Thousands died. Satwant Singh was sentenced to death and hanged in January 1989. Operation Blue Star and the assassination remain deeply decisive events.\n\nThis story originally appeared at Historical Firearms."

    "text": "The recent release of the latest Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report on t\ufeffhe worldwide trade in weapon systems has observers in Moscow asking unhappy questions. Their chief concern is that gains made in 2012-2017 by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in different regions are ultimately at the expense of sales that might otherwise have been made by Russian suppliers.\n\nThe issue was addressed in the last week of March by the editors of the Russian-language Nezavisimoye Voyennoe Obozreniye (NVO), one of the nation\u2019s most authoritative defense periodicals. The PRC\u2019s previous market share has been small, the editors write, and the nation has been more along the lines of a large-scale importer of weapons\u2014particularly those from Russian manufacturers.\n\nWhat has become the cause for worry, says the publication, is that \u201cin a short historical period of time, Beijing has made a sharp turn upwards and has broken into the ranks of the top five leading exporters\u2014turning the process of military-technical cooperation with foreign nations into an effective instrument of political and economic influence.\u201d\n\nThe PRC, the report notes, has made considerable investments in its defense industrial base. The increase in the number of arms exports has been accompanied by a commensurate improvement in the overall qualitative and technological ranking of the PRC\u2019s weapon systems. This telegraphs the \u201cserious objectives of the military and political leadership of the PRC to transform the country into a world-class power in all respects.\u201d\n\nThe PRC has had its traditional customers over the years, some of which were left to the Chinese, as they were nations that Russia found it inconvenient to cultivate as clients. The most prevalent of them is Pakistan. Sales by Moscow to Islamabad would undoubtedly damage relations with India, one of the longest-running and most profitable relationships for sale of Russian military hardware.\n\nHowever, what has driven the PRC\u2019s success in foreign sales is not Pakistan, but rather markets where Beijing is positioned to displace Russia as the main source of weaponry. Two developments mentioned in the NVO commentary were the recent sale of air defense systems to Turkmenistan, a former Soviet republic, and the announced intention in 2013 by Turkey to purchase an export version of the PRC\u2019s CASIC HQ-9, which is designated FD-2000 in the export configuration. The PRC is also blamed for \u201cblocking efforts by Russia to make significant inroads into selling military hardware to Indonesia.\u201d\n\nThe decision by the Turks to purchase a Chinese-made air defense system has been a sore point with Russian industry because the HQ-9 is a reverse-engineered copy of the Russian-made Almaz-Antei S-300. Furthermore, the follow-on model to the S-300 from Almaz-Antei, the S-400 system, was one of the other competing options presented to the Turks in the tender. Ultimately, the Turkish decision was overturned and they did not carry through with the procurement, buying the S-400 instead, but more than one Russian commentator has singled out this particular incident as a harbinger of future events.\n\nRussian defense industry analysts who spoke to AIN point out that Moscow may well be incapable of escaping this future, as Russia continues to sell some of its most advanced weaponry to the PRC. These are, most notably, the Sukhoi Su-35 Super-Flanker and the same S-400 air defense system that has been offered to other potential export customers.\n\n\u201cThe lure of making money has consistently overridden national security concerns and just plain common sense when it comes to selling our defense technology to the PRC,\u201d said one aerospace industry specialist in Moscow. \u201cNo one learned their lesson apparently when the Chinese spent the 1990s copying the Su-27. They then reneged on the 1996 contract to build 200 Su-27s under license\u2014as well as their obligation to pay the license fee per aircraft to the OEM\u2014after having built slightly more than half of the 200 Su-27s they had signed for. There is now every reason to believe that history will repeat itself with the Su-35.\u201d\n\nOthers point to the PRC\u2019s aircraft carrier program, almost all of which is based on Soviet/\ufeffRussian or Ukrainian-developed design know-how. The PLAN\u2019s sole operational carrier, the Type 001 CV-16 Liaoning, was originally built in the USSR as the Varyag, the sister ship to the Russian Navy\u2019s only carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov. The ship, later purchased by Beijing from the now-independent nation of Ukraine, was refitted in the PLAN\u2019s Dalian shipyards and then was copied to became the basis for the Type 001A CV-17 Shandong, a near copy of the Ukrainian original.\n\nThe Liaoning also operates the Shenyang J-15 carrier-capable fighter, itself a copy of the Sukhoi Su-33 that is flown off Kuznetsov. Another example in a consistent pattern of either cloning Russian hardware one-to-one or making close-copies that are then embellished with \u201cChinese characteristics.\"\n\n\u201cChinese weapon systems are going to continue to improve,\u201d said the aerospace specialist. \u201cThose who are worried about their chances of pushing Russia out of one arms market after another are not worrying for nothing.\u201d"

A development contract is eyed for the mid-2020s following years of concept studies.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Supporting systems are eyed to include unmanned aircraft of various types plus a data link architecture connecting all elements.\n\nGerman arms exports outside NATO and European Union countries have come under renewed fire since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by regime agents in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Saudi government initially denied knowing about the crime but was forced to acknowledge Khashoggi\u2019s death following weeks of international pressure."

Bernard Guillet.\n\n\"The improvement of our maintenance process and availability of our equipment is one of my priorities,\u201d she said.\n\nThat call for greater support reflects problems in servicing a highly mixed fleet, including new-generation armored vehicles to be delivered in the Scorpion program, modern VBCI infantry fighting vehicles and Caesar truck-mounted artillery, and an aging park of VAB troop carriers and VBL scout cars.\n\nThe plan seeks to boost the availability of vehicles by restructuring the industrial and technological base for service, boost a sense of responsibility of the personnel using the vehicles, and reshaping links between the armed forces and industry, the ministry said in a briefing note. There are also plans to increase local support in the deployed theaters and adopt new technology in monitoring and predicting breakdowns.\n\nThere is a high availability of more than 90 percent for vehicles in overseas operations, but those vehicles return to France in poor condition, with only 65 percent of the various fleets available for use once back on national territory, the ministry said. That availability varies greatly depending on the type of vehicle.\n\nThat means there is a lack of vehicles for training troops for deployment. Some 3,500 vehicles are broken down and there is a lack of capability to reduce that number. The British and German forces face similar problems, with lower availability and lack of an organization to improve the situation, the ministry said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe modernization plan calls for closer ties between government maintenance organizations, the armed forces and manufacturers including Arquus, Nexter, Safran and Thales, as well as specialist NSE and small- and medium-sized enterprises, the ministry said. Those actors should use more efficient tools and methods, and cut out duplication and waste of resources and time.\n\nA French military modernization program is getting a makeover Scorpion is seen as more than just bringing in new vehicles and equipment, as the French Army is rewriting the concept of operations to adapt to new technology.\n\nThe official report pointed up a \u201clack of sense of responsibility\u201d of the users as the vehicles are held in pools rather than assigned specifically, a contrast to an attachment of Air Force and Navy personnel who are closely tied to their aircraft and ships.\n\nCompanies showed a weak link with service support in the land sector, also in contrast to ties seen between industry and the naval and aeronautical sectors, the report said.\n\nThere should be greater use of new technology, adopting 3D printing and the use of health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) to predict breakdowns, the report said. Development under the Scorpion program offered industry an opportunity not to be missed to incorporate such technology.\n\nThe report called for equipment which was beyond repair to be handed over to industry to repair and resell, with the money to be shared between the government and industry.\n\n\"This reform requires a mobilization and a greater responsibility of industry in their performance and their capacity to honor the client\u2019s needs, whose objective is both to be effective on the ground and to guarantee the safety of soldiers,\u201d Parly said.\n\nSome 13,000 personnel are employed on vehicle service, with 11,000 in the armed forces. The balance is split between two government organizations \u2014 SMITer and SIMMT. The latter awards service contracts to companies.\n\nSome \u20ac1 billion (US $1.2 billion) has been earmarked for land vehicle service in the 2019-2015 defense budget law."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials are planning to increase military spending for fiscal 2020 by using temporary war funding accounts to get around federal budget caps, a controversial move that could undermine negotiations with lawmakers.\n\nIn an essay for Real Clear Politics on Monday, acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought wrote that the move is needed because \u201cDemocrats insist on demanding more social spending in exchange for continuing to fund defense spending,\u201d while President Donald Trump has called for cuts.\n\n\u201cExpanding the use of (overseas contingency) funds remains the administration\u2019s only fiscally responsible option in meeting national security needs while avoiding yet another increase to the spending caps,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe acknowledged that the move is likely to make fiscal conservatives \u201cuncomfortable\u201d but called it necessary given political opposition to Trump\u2019s past fiscal plans.\n\nTrump changes his mind again on military spending, now wants a big boost next year The president is expected this week to announce plans for $750 billion in fiscal 2020 military spending, a huge jump from previous targets.\n\nThe move comes as several lawmakers and budget analysts have pushed for reductions in the temporary war funding accounts, designed to cover only the ongoing operations overseas.\n\nCritics say that because the accounts aren\u2019t affected by congressionally mandated spending caps, they have become a hiding place for a host of desired program resets and expansions by the Pentagon.\n\nThe size of the war accounts has shrunk in recent years, from more than $100 billion in fiscal 2017 to less than $69 billion this fiscal year. Vought did not specify how large the president\u2019s request for fiscal 2020 will be, but Politico reported the fund could top $174 billion.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief - a daily roundup of military and defense news stories from around the globe. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIn the last few months, Trump has discussed a 5 percent cut for all federal agencies next fiscal year, as well as a $750 billion defense budget, an increase of more than 4 percent. The president and conservative defense lawmakers have argued the money is needed to rebuild military might after more than 17 years of war.\n\nBut congressional Democrats have already panned the military proposal as too high and said that adequate appropriations for the Departments of State and Homeland Security are as critical to national security as Pentagon spending. They have promised to make funding parity a key point of upcoming budget negotiations.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., and House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky., blasted the war funding reports as \u201ca gimmick to prop up defense spending\u201d by the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a blatant attempt to make a mockery of the federal budget process, obscure the true cost of military operations, and severely shortchange other investments vital to our national and economic security,\u201d they said in a statement.\n\nIn the last two fiscal years, lawmakers reached a compromise on defense and non-defense spending levels to avoid spending caps put in place in 2011. But those caps return again next fiscal year and limit defense spending to $576 billion and nondefense spending to $542 billion.\n\nVought said raising the cap for defense spending is necessary but lifting it for the other programs \u201cwould be a bad deal for taxpayers.\u201d He called the national debt a looming crisis for the country.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Congress to join the president in his commitment to cutting spending, reducing bloated deficits, and getting our national debt under control,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s future generations are depending on them.\u201d"

    "text": "Algeria evaluating Chinese CH-4 UAV\n\nDenel Seeker 400 takes to the skies\n\nWritten by defenceWeb, Tuesday, 11 March 2014Algerian is evaluating the Chinese CH-4 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is reportedly very interested in acquiring the type, which can be armed with guided weapons.The CH-4, developed by the China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA), has been undergoing testing with the Algerian military for some months, according to Air Forces Daily. One is reported to have crashed during testing at the Algerian Air Force\u2019s base at Tindouf several months ago while a second one crashed on Sunday at the Ain Oussera Air Base. The UAV came down 100 metres short of the runway whilst preparing to land.In spite of the crashes, Algeria is apparently still very interested in acquiring the CH-4 (Cai Hong 4 or Rainbow 4), which appears to have been inspired by the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. The UAV, with a takeoff weight of 1.3 tons and a payload of 350 kg, has a wingspan of 18 metres and a length of 8.5 metres. Top speed is 235 km/h and operational altitude is 3000-3500 metres, according to officially released data, while combat radius is 2000 km and endurance is 36 hours.CAAA technical staff claim the CH-4 has four hard points capable of carrying two AR-1 laser-guided missiles and two FT-5 small guided bombs.The CH-4 was first seen at the Zuhai airshow in 2012 and in the absence of Chinese military interest it seems the aircraft is aimed at the export market.Algeria has reportedly also been in discussions with China over the purchase of Xianglong unmanned aerial vehicles. Echorouk quoted an unnamed Algerian defence ministry colonel as saying that the UAV was successfully tested in Tamanrasset, southern Algeria, last year.The Xianglong (Soar Dragon) is a jet-powered High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft designed by the Guizhou Aircraft Corporation of China, initially for use by the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force. The Xianglong has a length of 14 metres, a height of 5 metres and a wingspan of 25 metres. It has a top speed of 750 km/h, endurance of up to 10 hours, and a maximum range of 7 000 km.Tactical Weekly earlier this year reported that the Algerian Defence Ministry is said to have decided to go ahead with a programme to buy 90 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including attack UAVs.Last year, Algeria expressed interest in the Adcom Systems Yabhon United 40 Block 5 UAV from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to meet its Medium-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) requirement. According to Algerian daily El Watan, Algeria is negotiating with Russia to purchase 30 E95 unmanned aerial vehicles/target drones from Russia.Algeria is looking for aerial reconnaissance platforms to track down various Maghreb-based terrorist groups, drug and arms traffickers and militants who have taken advantage of post-war chaos in Mali and Libya to destabilise the Sahel-Maghreb region.Algeria currently flies Denel Seeker II UAVs and is believed to have ordered one new Seeker 400 system with three aircraft. The Seeker 400 is currently undergoing flight testing.The North African country has previously expressed interest in General Atomics Predator/Reaper UAVs. It also has six King Air 350ER surveillance aircraft fitted with Gabbiano T-200 radars, Wescam Mx15i infrared cameras and other features for maritime and ground surveillance.Since war clouds started gathering over northern Mali in November 2012, the Algerian army has deployed more than 12 000 personnel to secure the borders with Mali, Libya and Niger.Algeria has increased its defence budget for 2014 and is actively seeking new tankers, transports, helicopters and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft. Last year Algeria evaluated the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport and Airbus A330 MRTT tanker with an eye to replacing ageing Il-78 Midas tankers and acquiring a new transport aircraft. Algeria asked the two respective companies to conduct demonstrations, indicating the seriousness of these potential contracts.Algeria is growing its defence spending by 6% through 2017, according to some estimates, as it modernises and re-equips to meet the challenge of insecurity and terrorism in the region.....Written by Guy Martin, Wednesday, 26 February 2014Denel\u2019s new Seeker 400 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) completed its first round of flight tests earlier this month at the Alkantpan test range in the Northern Cape, after a three year development process.The test flights were successful and will be followed by another round of testing in March ahead of production starting around the second half of this year.\u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Denel and again confirms our global leadership position in the design and manufacturing of UAVs,\u201d said Tsepo Monaheng, the CEO of Denel Dynamics.The Seeker 400 was originally due to fly a couple of years ago but was delayed due to contracting and certification issues, according to manufacturer Denel Dynamics. Denel\u2019s annual report for the 2012/13 financial year also identified \u201ccomplexities with the key subsystems\u201d as another reason for \u201csignificant variation in the programme schedule, including a delay of the maiden flight test.\u201dThe Seeker 400 was displayed in mock-up form at the 2010 Africa Aerospace and Defence exhibition. It has an endurance of 16 hours, a ceiling of 18 000 feet and a cruising speed is 150 km/h. Denel Dynamics says it is inaudible at altitudes higher than 1 000 metres above the ground and invisible to someone on the ground when flying at typical operating altitudes of between 4 500 and 9 000 feet.The Seeker 400 can carry 100 kg and this can include two payloads at the same time, including electro-optical/infrared and radar as well as a laser rangefinder and illuminator for target designation. Denel says an electronic surveillance payload is available for the detection and location of radar emitters. Future upgrades will include satellite communications, and sense-and-avoid capability in order to obtain civil aviation certification.Currently, the Seeker 400 has a range of 250 km, because it uses only line-of-sight communications, but it could be upgraded to use satellite communications, which would allow it to operate at much greater ranges. With the use of the existing tactical ground station (TGS), the range may be extended to 750 km.Denel Dynamics is executing a production contract for the UAV\u2019s launch customer (which previously operated the Seeker I) and has also attracted strong interest from other potential clients, with most demand expected to come from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and South America. Denel is promoting the Seeker 400 to Seeker II customers, as the new UAV can be flown with Seeker II control stations.Monaheng said the Seeker 400 is a highlight in South Africa\u2019s development of local UAVs, which started in the mid-1980s. Its forerunner, the Seeker II, has been deployed in operational service by international clients, including in Afghanistan. The Seeker was also the first UAV in the world cleared for operations in controlled airspace when it was deployed to monitor potential hotspots during South Africa\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994.The Seeker II has undergone further developments by Denel Dynamics, and has since rebranded as the Seeker 200, and offered to clients who require a medium endurance and dual payload capability offered by the latest version."

    "text": "TOKYO -- Japan is considering selling air defense radar technology to the Philippines in what would be its first export of defense equipment since ending a nearly 50-year ban in 2014.\n\nTokyo is sounding out the Philippines about buying an upgraded model of the Mitsubishi Electric-made FPS-3 air defense radar system, which Japan's Air Self-Defense Force has used since 1991 in missile defense and monitoring airspace incursions. Tokyo has already begun offering technical information on the system to Manila.\n\nJapan's thinking goes that upgrading the less-than-cutting-edge radar to meet the Philippines' needs will keep costs down, helping it win orders. The price is expected to be between 1 billion yen and 2 billion yen ($8.87 million and $17.7 million). Manila has also approached the U.S. and Israel on the matter, according to a source connected to the Japanese government, and may decide as early as the start of next year.\n\nJapan's defense cooperation with the Philippines, which had centered on joint military exercises, has expanded into defense equipment in recent years. In March, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force donated TC-90 trainer craft to the Philippine navy. And Japan agreed in June to grant parts for multi-mission UH-1H helicopters formerly used by the Ground Self-Defense Force to the Philippine air force.\n\nThe two sides are interested in partnering on maritime security as China continues to build up its military presence in the South China Sea, a vital sea lane for goods and energy shipments for both Tokyo and Manila. By exporting air-defense radars to the Philippines, Japan hopes to improve the Southeast Asian country's detection and surveillance capabilities and help maintain safety in the region.\n\nJapan essentially banned arms exports for decades until April 2014, when the cabinet laid out basic rules letting the country transfer defense equipment and technology and participate in international joint development under certain conditions, such as when it contributes to Japan's security. Selling the radars to the Philippines was judged appropriate because it would further bilateral defense cooperation.\n\nTokyo has not yet sold any defense equipment under the new rules. Japan sought to build submarines for export to Australia, but lost the deal to France in 2016. An effort to sell P-1 patrol jets to the U.K. also fell through, and Japan lost a bid to supply radar for the Thai air force to a Spanish company."

    "text": "Taipei has a new idea instead: the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nTAIPEI - Taiwan\u2019s air force will cease campaigning for the F-35 Lightning stealth fighter aircraft and will, instead, reissue a request to the U.S. government for F-16 fighters.\n\nThe new proposal will push for the release of sixty-six F-16V Block 70 fighters, with an additional six aircraft to replace crashed F-16A/B Block 20s (seventy-two total aircraft).\n\nThis is, in part, a resurrection of an abandoned effort to procure sixty-six F-16C/D Block 50/52s killed by the Obama administration due to Chinese pressure. Beijing had dubbed the sale of new F-16s to Taiwan a \u201cred line\u201d and has repeatedly threatened to invade the self-ruled island.\n\nThe new campaign will also request co-production and performance-based logistics (PBL) as part of the overall package. PBL would improve combat effectiveness by 80 percent, say Taiwan defense industry sources.\n\nOne source said PBL was a \u201ccritical part of the package\u2026we must have it.\u201d\n\nThe package is consistent with Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen\u2019s indigenous defense industry policy that mandates local production of weapon systems that in the past were procured only from the United States. In part, the policy weens Taiwan away from dependency on the United States for weapon sales that are often influenced by Washington\u2019s fickle relationship with Beijing.\n\nLocal sources also want the PBL to expand later to include Taiwan\u2019s current F-16 upgrade effort. Taiwan procured 150 F-16A/B Block 20 fighters in the 1990s and is currently upgrading them to F-16V as part of the $5 billion Phoenix Rising Program.\n\nThe PBL could later be expanded for the fleet of twenty C-130H Hercules cargo/transport aircraft and twelve P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, all Lockheed Martin products.\n\nThe air force is also upgrading its Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDF) under a program that will allow the IDF to carry more munitions and replace its radar and combat computer. Taiwan is down to 126 aircraft from the original 130 due to crashes. It was constructed in the 1990s by state-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) in Taichung, which is also participating in the F-16V upgrade program.\n\nAIDC is currently manufacturing a new advanced jet trainer (AJT) to replace its ageing AT-3 and F-5 fighter trainers. The new AJT, expected to roll-out in late 2019, is loosely based on the IDF design. AIDC plans to build sixty-six aircraft with operational deployment in 2026.\n\nThe air force turned its back on pursuing the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) fighter due to a recent Taiwan National Security Council report. It indicated the stealth fighter was too exorbitant and untested in real combat to be a pragmatic choice for Taiwan.\n\nThere are also suspicions in Taiwan that opposition to the sale of a fifth-generation fighter would be raised in Washington over secrecy issues, as mainland Chinese espionage on the island is rampant.\n\nThe STOVL option was originally considered a practical requirement due to China\u2019s vast arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan. Military analysts in Taiwan and Washington predict that the air bases will be pummeled during the initial phase of a war.\n\nHowever, Taiwan still needs an advanced fighter aircraft capability to maintain sovereignty and control of its air space, especially as China begins testing the island\u2019s air defense capabilities with fighter and bomber aircraft sorties that now circumnavigate the island.\n\nTaiwan will also retire its ageing Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft due to high maintenance costs and to make room in the budget for new F-16s. Of the sixty fighters France sold Taiwan in the 1990s, fifty-six remain operational. \u201cWe would like to resale the Mirage fighters to a third country,\u201d said one source.\n\nWendell Minnick is an author, commentator, journalist and speaker who has spent two decades covering military and security issues in Asia, including one book on intelligence and over 1,200 articles.

Both UAV types are the outcomes of efforts of a team of .\n\n\u201cNAF\u2019s foray into UAV development commenced in 2008, when its student officers, who were undergoing postgraduate studies in aerospace engineering programmes at Cranfield University, UK, chose UAV development as their research project. The student officers produced the as part of their project and it had neither autopilot nor Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability.\n\n\u201cBy 2013, the NAF developed an experimental UAV, codenamed GULMA, which was then unveiled as the first indigenous UAV. It is noteworthy that Gulma UAV was a technology demonstrator used to gather performance data on UAV systems.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in September 2015, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), , directed the NAF\u2019s R&D Team to build an operational UAV, codenamed Tsaigumi to be used in the Northeast and other theatres of operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe data gathered from the Gulma prototype was subsequently applied in the design of the operational UAV, known as Tsaigumi, and inducted into service on 15 February 2018. Although the Tsaigumi UAV was manufactured at the Air Force Research and Development Centre at NAF Base Kaduna, the Team had to collaborate with an overseas facility to produce the moulds.\n\n\u201cTsaigumi UAV, which is capable of day and night operations, has an operational endurance in excess of 10 hours, a service ceiling of 15,000 feet and a mission radius of 100km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 80kg and its payload comprises an electro-optical infrared camera system as well as weapon hard points. The Tsaigumi UAV, whose engine sound is muffled, has a state of the art encrypted communication system.\n\n\"It has a wingspan of 5.5metres and is able to gather real time weather information. On the contrary, the Gulma UAV has an operational endurance of 4 hours, a service ceiling of 5,000 feet and could not be operated beyond 20km. It has a maximum take-off weight of 40kg and its payload is an electro-optical camera system only. The Gulma UAV, whose engine sound is not muffled, relies on direct radio frequency communication system with attendant limitations.\n\n\u201cThe Gulma has a wingspan of 4.4 metres and relies on Air Traffic Control for weather information. Besides, while the Gulma UAV has an imported autopilot, the operational Tsaigumi UAV has an in-house developed autopilot. Tsaigumi UAV is thus a much more advanced and operationalized version of the earlier produced Amebo and Gulma UAV prototypes,\u201d he announced.\n\nAdesanya said the NAF is currently working on ICHOKU, which when completed, would be the first indigenous Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) in Nigeria."

Professor Lee claimed that part of North Korea\u2019s national defense expenses had been concealed behind \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d of the people\u2019s economic expenses.\n\nIt has been doubtful that the North Korea\u2019s national defense expenditures revealed officially didn\u2019t accord with expanded military forces in practice.\n\nThe study analyzed documents such as assembly proceedings by the North Korean People\u2019s Committee in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s and a yearbook of North Korea. The study detected that \u201ccommodities and production capital\u201d excluded from the People\u2019s economic expenses were omitted from the official financial budget.\n\nThough there are some difficulties in applying this analysis to the present time taking into account that the analysis was based on documents made 30-40 years ago, this study is significant considering that it may provide a clue to the mishaps of North Korea\u2019s obscure national defense expenditures.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s national expenditure is divided into major departments including the people\u2019s economic expenses, social and cultural expenses, military expenses and administrative expenses.\n\nOn the agenda of the People\u2019s economic expenses is \u201ccommodities and reserved production.\u201d These expenses form part of the commodities and production capital which is used to acquire war materials and materials for national defense. Here, war materials indicate military supplies such as ammunitions and guns, whereas materials for national defense represent items such as oil and food used in the military.\n\nBased on the cost of construction balance from the People\u2019s economic expenditure from 1967~1971, the study analyzes that 30~40% of funds, in fact 5~8 hundred million won had been concealed from the official budget. At the time, 2.16 North Korea won was worth $1 according to an official fixed exchange rate.\n\nThis year, North Korea estimated its national budget to balance at 433.2 trillion won ($30.9bn, $1-141won). Further, North Korea estimated its national defense budget to make up 15.8% of the budget, quoting 68.47 trillion won ($489mn)."

Mr. AL\u0130\u015e underlined that there is a pleasing increase in the value-added per kilogram of defence industry products. \"The value-added per kilogram in Defence Industry approached 46 dollars, so we are selling technology now.\"\n\nNoting that the current position of the Defence Industry is still behind the five largest exporting countries in the world, Mr. AL\u0130\u015e stated that their target is to become one of the top five major export companies in the world within a few years, \"We aim for 60% growth in the first six months of the year. Turkish products became quite competitive in the global market in terms of quality and price. Their value in the world is increased now.\"\n\nPresident of the Defence Industries Prof. Dr. \u0130smail DEM\u0130R said, \"The increase in the export figures is pleasing but it is far below our expectations.

Turkish Defence Industry companies made sales worth of US$175 Million in January, US$171 Million in February, and around US$250 Million in March. In the same period of 2018, these figures were US$106 Million in January, US$149 Million in February and US$147 Million in March.\n\nAccording to the information we received, the target of US$3 Billion set for 2019 does not include the MILGEM and ATAK platforms of Pakistan and T129 ATAK helicopters for the Philippines. This figure is expected to increase with the start of these projects."

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2015 Dutch and German defense acquisition leaders have agreed to boost their cooperation on naval matters, a move that could put a fresh spin on major shipbuilding programs currently in play, Defense News has learned.\n\nThe topic came up at a closed-door bilateral meeting of national armament directors this week, officials said. The gathering was meant as a broad examination of new defense cooperation opportunities with a particular focus on joint maritime projects.\n\nA defense spokesman in Berlin said details of the meeting were confidential, noting only that the government was broadly interested in harmonizing defense programs with allies.\n\nThe Netherlands is in the market to replace its four aging Walrus-class submarines by 2027. Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems was tapped last year to build four Type 212 air-independent propulsion boats for Norway and two for Germany, to be delivered in the mid-2020s.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch shipyard Damen, together with Germany\u2019s Blohm & Voss, is in the running for the German Navy\u2019s Mehrzweckkampfschiff 180, a frigate-type surface combatant.\n\nThese three German drones are worth watching With the number of German major weapon programs at a new high, three Bundeswehr drone projects are up for critical milestones in the coming months, the defense ministry told parliament in a new report.\n\nBerlin excluded a competing consortium of TKMS and L\u00fcrssen from that deal weeks ago due to what insiders said where insurmountable differences about the TKMS surface ship division\u2019s approach to that program.\n\nThat move prompted backers of the only purely German-owned industry team to lament the loss of a purely Teutonic contender in the program. Notably, however, TKMS has shown no interest in challenging the MKS 180 exclusion in court.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how a new umbrella of German-Dutch naval jointness might influence upcoming program decisions. But officials said seeking avenues to bring the Netherlands in alignment with the German-Dutch sub buy may make sense in the spirit of coordinating such acquisitions Europe-wide."

    "text": "The Coast Guard\u2019s long-sought heavy icebreaker, the Polar Security Cutter, was among the programs to receive funding when Congress passed a spending package on late Thursday.\n\nThe Coast Guard is receiving $655 million to start construction on the lead ship for a new class of Polar Security Cutter and is receiving an addition $20 million to purchase long-lead-time materials for a second heavy icebreaker, as part of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations bill, Congressional staffers told USNI News.\n\nLast summer, the Senate had agreed to appropriate $755 million for the Polar Security Cutter. The House of Representatives, though, instead provided DHS with $5 billion to build a wall along the border with Mexico while canceling funding for a variety of programs including the Polar Security Cutter.\n\n\u201cWith the support of the administration and Congress, we plan to build a new fleet of six polar icebreakers \u2013 at least three of which must be heavy icebreakers \u2013 and we need the first new Polar Security Cutter immediately to meet America\u2019s needs in the Arctic,\u201d read a statement from the service provided to USNI News. \u201cThe United States is an Arctic nation with extensive national and global responsibilities. Our role in the Arctic is growing. Diminishing Arctic sea ice is expanding access to the region and attracting attention from both partner and rival states across the globe. Resource extraction, fisheries, tourism and commercial shipping, in conjunction with traditional Alaska native activities, are driving increased maritime activity and a greater need for Coast Guard presence in the region. America\u2019s only heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star, is more than 40 years old and must be replaced by the new Polar Security Cutter.\u201d\n\nThe Coast Guard has for several years pushed for funding the ice breaker program. Currently, the Coast Guard has only one operational heavy icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10), commissioned in 1976. A second icebreaker, USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11) has not been operational since a 2010 engine failure and instead has for nearly a decade served as a parts donor to keep Polar Star running, USNI News reported in 2017.\n\nFor years, having only one working heavy icebreaker hindered the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to satisfy mission requests from government agencies effectively. The Coast Guard was only able to fulfill 78 percent of heavy icebreaking missions between 2010 and 2016, according to a September 2017 Government Accountability Office report.\n\nHouse Appropriations subcommittee on Homeland Security member Rep David Price (D-N.C.) told USNI News that the new bill will start to build up what he sees as a critical U.S. capability.\n\n\u201cWith China and Russia showing increased interest in the Arctic region, the Coast Guard\u2019s Arctic Strategy is more critical than ever to our national security,\u201d Price said in a statement to USNI News. For years, there has been a significant gap in our nation\u2019s icebreaking capabilities, and I\u2019m pleased the bipartisan FY19 omnibus bill includes funding to finally construct a new Polar Security Cutter, as well as money to begin purchasing long lead time materials for a second. The new Polar Security Cutter will ensure that our national security and economic interests are protected, that our marine vessels are provided safe passage, and that the United States has the ability to counter increased Russian aggression.\u201d"

    "text": "Author: Nicole Jenne, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile\n\nIn March 2018, Cambodia and Thailand announced plans for several joint initiatives relating to trans-border movements, including a deal on exchanging fugitives, including exiled political figures. The move comes as both governments show increasingly authoritarian tendencies. But though the deal was hailed by its protagonists as beginning a new era of cooperation, the agreement to hunt down political refugees \u2014 if implemented at all \u2014 will not dramatically change relations between the two countries.\n\nIn the week of 19 March, Cambodia\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, Tea Banh, travelled to Bangkok to co-chair the 13th meeting of the Cambodian\u2013Thai General Border Committee. Besides meeting his Thai counterpart Prawit Wongsuwon, Banh visited Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha on the latter\u2019s birthday on 21 March. Banh\u2019s meeting with Prayuth attracted considerably more attention than that of the General Border Committee, a two-decade-old dialogue mechanism that has yet to impress with substantial results.\n\nBanh and Prayuth announced a deal to exchange fugitives and \u2018monitor individuals who escape the law by crossing the border\u2019. \u2018Fugitives\u2019 likely refer to exiled members of the political opposition from the respective countries. After the coup in Thailand in 2014, over 100 Thai nationals sought refuge in Cambodia, many to avoid lengthy prison sentences under the country\u2019s harsh lese-majeste law. Thailand, in turn, has hosted at least dozens of Cambodia\u2019s ex-opposition party members since the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved in November 2017.\n\nThe new deal places the exiled opposition from both countries in an even more precarious situation. Only a few days after the agreement was made public, the Phnom Penh Post reported that vehicles from the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) had been stationed near the Bangkok homes of ex-CNRP members. Phnom Penh justified the presence of the vehicles by saying that the RCAF only operate in Bangkok in cooperation with Thai authorities to tackle transnational crime.\n\nBut recent trends indicate that crime suppression can serve as a cover for politically motivated charges. Both the regimes in Cambodia and Thailand are increasingly repressive and share an interest in preventing the political opposition from organising abroad. For Prime Minister Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party (CPP), this is especially relevant ahead of the country\u2019s general elections in July this year.\n\nA case that set a potential precedent earlier in 2018 involved the extradition of a Cambodian labour activist from Thailand in what was a violation of customary international law. The same international law principles also apply under an extradition agreement signed between the two countries in 2011. Accordingly, forced return is permissible only if the crime for which extradition is sought exists in both countries. Extradition needs to be rejected if there is reason to believe that the request is politically motivated.\n\nIn 2009, it was on these grounds that Cambodia rejected a request by the then Democratic Party government to extradite former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The rejection came just a week after Hun Sen appointed Thaksin as his economic advisor. Under Thaksin, Thailand and Cambodia had forged closer business ties, and Thaksin and Hun Sen developed a close relationship. But after Thaksin\u2019s ouster in the 2006 coup, bilateral relations deteriorated as a result of conflict at the border near the Preah Vihear temple.\n\nWith the regime change in Bangkok in 2014, it is even clearer that reciprocity and political favours weigh more than legal commitments. In the wake of the CPP\u2019s uncomfortably narrow victory in the 2013 elections, Phnom Penh sought international allies and reached out to the newly installed military government in Bangkok. Banh assured Prayuth as early as 2014 that \u2018Cambodia has no policy to allow anyone to use its land to operate against Thailand\u2019.\n\nIn this sense, the agreement in March to exchange fugitives is a formalisation of developments already underway. All the same, the deal is unlikely to bring about substantial changes. Political alliances based on a common enemy are usually of limited duration. In contrast to positive cooperation for a common good, negative cooperation against a threat tends to aim to do the bare minimum. Such joint security measures have limited objectives and are rarely adopted as part of a larger reform package that would induce a qualitative shift in bilateral relations.\n\nThe agreement to exchange fugitives fails to address the range of issues that have led to uneasy relations between Cambodia and Thailand. These include unresolved border disputes, such as the pending implementation of the International Court of Justice\u2019s 2013 ruling on the border near Preah Vihear. Disagreements also cover the growing role of China in Southeast Asia \u2014 particularly in Cambodia \u2014 as well as several transnational issues such as labour migration, smuggling and illegal logging.\n\nIn contrast, the General Border Committee meeting appeared to make some headway in improving cross-border mobility through the creation of several new permanent border gates. If implemented, these measures may facilitate trade and better regulation of illegal crossings. Unlike the authoritarian extradition deal, they could lead to a real improvement in bilateral relations.\n\nNicole Jenne is Assistant Professor at the Institute of Political Science, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has objected to 37 provisions in the House draft of the annual Pentagon policy bill, but it stopped short of threatening a presidential veto.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday released a policy statement on the draft 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, which is being debated in the House this week. The statement said the president will support the bill\u2019s passage, and detailed what the administration hopes legislators will massage as the bill churns through Congress.\n\nThe White House objected to the bill\u2019s prohibition on the Air Force killing the JSTARS recap program and starting afresh with a family-of-systems approach called the Advanced Battle Management System.\n\n\u201cThe JSTARS recapitalization program will be unable to perform its mission in high-end contested environments, which is counter to the National Defense Strategy,\u201d the statement reads. It called an investment in ABMS \u201cprudent\u201d and a better fit for future military fights.\n\nThe bill\u2019s elimination of the $222 million for the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter is also premature, according to the memo. The C-135 is the replacement for aging reconnaissance aircraft that enforce the 1992 Open Skies Treaty.\n\nThe administration objects to a proposed increase from 11 aircraft carriers to 12, \u201cwhich may not be sustainable\u201d under the Navy\u2019s current budget. The White House also opposes a provision in the bill that prohibits the Navy from fully exercising five-year procurement authority for the Virginia-class submarine, or SSN, until it certifies it will procure two more SSNs than the budget contains.\n\nThe White House would rather not shutter the Defense Information Systems Agency. It\u2019s not on board with the bill\u2019s transfer of all information technology contracting, acquisition, and senior leader communication services from DISA to other DoD elements.\n\n\u201cThis action would increase the cost of acquiring information technology, weaken the Department\u2019s ability to secure its cyber networks, and inhibit DISA\u2019s mission to provide seamless communication to warfighters and senior leaders,\u201d the policy statement reads.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

That\u2019s objectionable because the SCO\u2019s work is \u201ccritical to maintaining our advantage over our strategic competitors,\u201d according to the statement, which also pointed to concern that its elimination and transfer of functions would place operating forces at risk.\n\n"

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Following a record year for mergers and acquisitions in the aerospace and defense industry, activity in the sector is strong, despite a fall from last year\u2019s cloud-nine highs, according to a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\nThe value of 2018 industry deals to date is $30.3 billion, nearly half the value at the same time last year, but still 48 percent above the $21.3 billion, 10-year annual deal average, the PwC report said.\n\nDeal volume and average deal size are both down from this time last year, 18 and 41 percent respectively, to 290 deals, averaging $197.1 million. Some of this disparity can be accounted for by the lack of a monster, blockbuster deal like United Technologies Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Rockwell Collins for $30 billion last September.\n\nUnlike last year\u2019s four \u201cMegadeals\u201d ($5 billion-plus), only General Dynamics' acquisition of CSRA qualifies so far in 2018.\n\nDespite the lack of any high-value transactions in the third quarter, one notable move is Boeing\u2019s announced agreement to acquire 80 percent of Embraer\u2019s commercial business for $3.8 billion, the PwC report emphasized.\n\nThe report noted that a higher focus on information technology infrastructure, cybersecurity, cloud computing and C4ISR is pushing a number of nontraditional and financial buyers to target diversified IT service organizations.\n\nThe report attributes decreased merger and acquisition activity in the sector to \u201ca slowdown in new orders for aerospace [original equipment manufacturers] and the absence of a significant number of large transactions.\u201d This relatively tame level of activity may be expected to increase as industry becomes \u201cdriven by an increased focus on emerging technologies, intensified competition and [a] rise in government spending to modernize the IT infrastructure,\u201d said Bob Long, U.S. aerospace and defense deals leader for PwC.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

    "text": "A fracas over a telephonic message from the Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to Imran Khan on 23 August only added to the already strained relations between the US and its former South Asian ally. Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi contradicted the content of the call. The State Department had said in readout that during the call \u201cPompeo raised the importance of Pakistan taking decisive action against all terrorists operating in Pakistan\u201d. Islamabad refuted the US readout as incorrect, saying that this \u201cissue of terrorism\u201d was not discussed. However, when questioned by a reporter, the U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said there would be no correction in response to Pakistan\u2019s complaint. \u201cI can only say we stand by our readout,\u201d\n\nMike Pompeo\u2019s message was preceded by the visit of Iranian foreign minister Zarif to Islamabad and Imran Khan Government\u2019s outright expression of support to Iranian stand in the face of Trump\u2019s threat to rescind the nuclear deal. Pakistani foreign minister\u2019s mind was also worked about the New Delhi visit of the US high-power delegation likely to take place after about a week of its visit to Islamabad. By raising the controversy Pakistan government wanted to give a message to the people that the US had taken the first initiative for rapprochement in bilateral relations that had begun to nosedive with the famous remark of Trump that \u201cwe gave billions of dollars to Pakistan and in return, they gave us lies and deceit.\u201d Qureshi\u2019s compulsion of distorting the factual message reflects discomfiture caused by Washington\u2019s insistence on \u201cdo more\u201d.\n\nPak Foreign Minister\u2019s attempt to dilute the content of the telephonic talk becomes meaningless when we focus on Pentagon\u2019s overview of Pak-US relations with reference to the fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe denial could also be an attempt to dodge the closely guarded commitment that Pakistan army top brass might have made to their counterparts in Washington. What was the army top brass of the two sides talking about all these months? In a statement given at a briefing in the Pentagon the spokesman Mr Faulkner said \u201cSince January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan\u201d. Does Pakistan army now want to make the scapegoat of the civilian government for wriggling out of the broad frame of a formula worked out during these parleys for ending Afghan crisis?\n\nDays before Pompeo delegation\u2019s departure for Pakistan, Defence Secretary James Mattis said in a news briefing at the Pentagon that in their talks with Pakistani officials, the delegation will \u201cmake very clear what we have to do, all of our nations, in meeting our common foe, the terrorists, and make that a primary part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nEvidently, the issue at hand is Afghan war and Pakistan\u2019s hand in fuelling its flames. Noting that repeated warnings to Pakistan to deny safe haven to Afghan Taliban, particularly the Haqqani and Let networks fighting the US-led NATO forces have fallen on flat ears, Trump administration put into practice its three-point agenda of containing global terrorism with epicentre in Af-Pak region as was announced by him in his speech in Saudi Arabia last year. He earmarked three facets of US\u2019 new strategy for South Asia viz. (a) stripping terrorists of their territory (b) cutting off their funding and (c) exposing the false allure of their evil ideology. \u201cTerrorists are nothing but thugs, criminals and predators\u201d, he had concluded.\n\nReferring to Afghanistan and Pakistan in his Camp David speech last year, President Trump had underlined the basics of his strategy as (a) stopping resurgence of safe havens and (b) preventing nuclear weapons and materials being used against us or anywhere in the world. This very emphatically suggests that Trump administration\u2019s main concern is to find a mechanism that would deny the terrorist groups in Af-Pak region access to Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nTrump administration\u2019s indication of discouraging IMF to bail out Pakistan with 9 billion dollar loan from its crumbling financial crisis is in addition to the cancellation of US dollars 300 million aid to Pak army. The loud and clear warning has come on the eve of the visit to Islamabad of a high powered US government delegation. Pakistan foreign minister Qureshi is trying to minimize the adverse impact of the cancellation of a hefty amount of aid by raising flimsy technical issues. However, Lt. Col. Kone Faulkner, the Pentagon spokesman in an email to the AFP made clear why the US had blocked the amount of aid. He said, \u201cDue to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy\u2026 $300m (actually $323.6m to include non-Pakistan funds) was reprogrammed by the Defence Department in the June/July 2018 time frame for selected urgent priorities\u201d.\n\nThis statement touches on the essence of the irritants between the two countries. It found reverberation in the statement of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Joseph F. Dunford, who also had attended the Congressional briefing, that the US had \u201cpermanent interests in South Asia\u201d and wanted to \u201cmaintain a presence (there) to have influence in that region\u201d.\n\nIncidentally, General Dunford\u2019s inclusion in the delegation dispels the impression that this was not a proper visit but just a stopover, as US State and Defence Secretaries were both going to be in New Delhi next week for the first two-plus-two talks between the United States and India.\n\nThe \u201cpermanent interest in the region\u201d to which the American General was referring has to be understood by what President Trump expressed about dismantling of terrorist organizations active in Afghanistan-Pakistan region, and its threat to American interests. President Trump asserted that 9/11 had originated in that very region. A further clarification of the expression of interest is reflected more eloquently in how Trump looks at India in his vision of the new South Asian strategy. He had made a very clear and threadbare statement:\n\n\u201cAnother critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India \u2014 the world\u2019s largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States. We appreciate India\u2019s important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development. We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region\u201d.\n\nAt the Pentagon meeting Secretary Defence, Mattis said, \u201cWe see the strengthening of India\u2019s democracy, its military, its economy as a stabilising element in the world. And we want to make certain that where we have common interests, we are working together.\u201d\n\nThis is a paradigm shift in US\u2019 South Asia policy. In other words, US acknowledges the significance of India\u2019s role in stabilizing peace in the South Asian region where Afghanistan and Kashmir continue to be the zones of activity of terrorist organizations, particularly those that have been designated by the US or the UN. The first pillar of the new strategy in South Asia enunciated by President Trump and stated above is of \u201cstripping terrorists of their territory\u201d. This means chalking out of a joint strategy with frien0dly countries to deny space to the terrorists presently active in two conflict zones in South Asia. The message is clear and loud for all terrorist networks and their handlers as well as safe haven providers\n\nAs for the second pillar meaning \u201ccutting off their funding\u201d the Trump administration has taken two explicit steps viz. using its clout with IMF to obstruct bailing out Pakistan from financial crunch and cancellation of 300 million US dollar aid, a proposal waiting Congressional determination likely to come before the close of September.\n\nCuriously, Pakistani foreign minister Qureshi has disputed the $33b figure quoted by President Trump, insisting that around half of the money relates to reimbursements. His contention about the cancelled aid is that the payment, which the US is now considering scrapping, is, in fact, the support coalition fund. \u201cThis is not an aid of any kind that can be suspended,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is actually the payment of expenses incurred by us during the war against terrorism.\u201d However, forcefully rebutting Pakistan\u2019s contention, Pentagon spokesperson Faulkner analysed the US stand as this.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, recent reporting has distorted the details of the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) by stating several things out of context. The suspension of security assistance to Pakistan was announced in January 2018. The CSF is included in the suspension and it remains in place. This is not a new decision or a new announcement, but an acknowledgement of a July request to reprogram funds before they expire. Reminding Pakistan that since January, they have consistently engaged with Pakistani military officials at the highest levels, based on both a shared commitment to defeat all terrorist groups that threaten regional stability and security, as well as on a shared vision of a peaceful future for Afghanistan.\n\nHe made it clear that the US \u201ccontinues to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups, including the Haqqani Network and LeT, and we continue to call on Pakistan to arrest, expel or bring the Taliban leadership to the negotiating table.\u201d Asserting that 2018 DoD Appropriations Act, published on March 23, details $500 million was rescinded by the Congress. He dismissed the Pakistani stand by arguing that owing to a lack of Pakistani decisive actions in support of the South Asia Strategy, the remaining $300 million was reprogrammed by the Department of Defence (DoD) in July 2018 time frame for other urgent priorities before the funds expire on September 30.\n\nIn final analysis the message brought to Islamabad by the US delegation boils down to this: Sever all links with Taliban terrorist groups including Haqqani and LeT networks; become our partner in new South Asian strategy of uprooting terrorism of all hues and in stabilizing peace in the region; ensure that nuclear weapon and material does not fall into the hands of terrorists. In return, we shall restore the process of giving the aid money and develop a sound partnership in bilateral trade and commerce.\n\nEvidently, Pakistan will make a deep study of the repercussions of dropping down the Haqqani and LeT networks as that would amount to the all-time departure from the policy of carving strategic space westward and eastward with focus on Afghanistan and Kashmir. Islamabad will also carefully study the outcome of the US high-level team\u2019s parleys with the Indians next week. Interestingly, New Delhi has done some advance spadework in J&K as a complement to the US\u2019 theorem of stripping terrorists of their territory. Dismissal of the PDP-led coalition government was part of cooperation for counter-terrorism. The continuation of the process will see the revival of the suspended assembly to prop up a government with far less commitment to the spectre of separatism and fundamentalism.\n\nIslamabad will closely watch to what extent the US high power delegation will gravitate to the Indian perception of terror phenomenon in South Asia. In the impending 2 + 2 meets in New Delhi, the status of Sino-Russian forays into South Asia and India-Pacific politics is likely to be the keynote subject for discussion. Remember that the Chinese foreign minister is expected to show up in Islamabad soon after the departure of the visiting US delegation."

Others are used for training."

    "text": "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly signed off on a Ministry of Industry and Trade proposal to for defense and high-technology holding Rostec to help fund a high-profile civilian airliner project managed by the United Aircraft Company.\n\nAccording to the Kommersant newspaper, citing several unidentified government and industry sources, the 30 billion ruble (U.S. $535 million) investment in United Aircraft\u2019s MS-21 commercial airliner project may pave the way for an eventual takeover of the company \u2014 which is Russia\u2019s second largest defense contractor, and the world\u2019s 14th largest according to the 2017 Defense News Top 100 ranking of global defense enterprises.\n\nPutin reportedly signed off on the proposal by stamping a January 23rd letter from Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov, according to an unidentified Kremlin source cited by Kommersant. In the letter, according to Kommersant, Manturov wrote that Rostec has \u201cconfirmed the possibility of allocating about 30 billion rubles to the MS-21.\u201d\n\nKommersant was unable to secure official confirmation from the Kremlin, and a request for comment from the Industry and Trade Ministry went unanswered. When approached by Defense News for comment, the United Aircraft Corporation declined to comment on the proposal for Rostec financing of the MS-21 project. However, a source from United Aircraft spokesman said that \u201cany aircraft development program such as the MS-21 is investment intensive. And capital investment is better than borrowed investment.\u201d Ultimately, he added, such a decision isn\u2019t even up to Rostec, \u201cas the decisions are made elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRostec has heavy influence in both commercial and defense markets, primarily pulling in Russian tank production. Defense News Executive Editor Jill Aitoro spoke to CEO Sergey Chemezov during IDEX in Abu Dhabi to find out what is ahead for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reported MS-21 financing proposal is seen in Moscow as the first step in a broader play by Rostec to consolidate its control over the Russian defense industry. In 2015, the company\u2019s former president, an experienced aerospace engineer who one lead MiG and Sukhoi named Mikhail Pogosyan, was replaced by former Deputy Industry and Trade Minister Yury Slyusar.\n\nSlyusar is considered to be an ally of Sergey Chemezov, the head of Rostec. Chemezov, himself reported to be an old friend of Putin\u2019s, has presided over the gradual expansion of Rostec\u2019s defense industry holdings over the past decade. Rostec today controls over two-thirds of the Russian defense industry. Acquiring UAC would be a major expansion of its holdings.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cIt is an open secret that Rostec is trying to absorb as much of the industry as they can,\u201d a defense industry source told Defense News on a condition of anonymity. \u201cRostec makes certain moves, and then Manturov supports them. The company is, in effect, a kind of shadow ministry of defense industry production.\u201d\n\nBut UAC\u2019s fate is not yet sealed. According to Kommersant, Rostec itself has reservations. If the company takes control of UAC, it will also find itself responsible for financing the company\u2019s projects beyond the MS-21 airliner. With development of high-end military aircraft going on at Sukhoi, MiG, and even Tupolev, such a burden could end up being substantial.\n\nBut jockeying for control over the company continues behind the scenes, Kommersant reported. In November, the newspaper reported that the Industry and Trade Ministry had already worked out a proposal with the Economic Development and Finance Ministries by which the state\u2019s 91.7 percent ownership of the company would be transferred to Rostec.\n\nThat proposal was blocked by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who\u2019s portfolio includes oversight of the Russian defense and space industries. Rogozin has argued that there is no economic justification for such a transfer. Manturov\u2019s proposal, however, is supported by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Kommersant reported.\n\n\u201cRogozin is lobbying in the other direction,\u201d the defense industry source told Defense News. \u201cHe is pushing for a merger of United Aircraft Corporation with Roscosmos, the state space corporation, in an effort to create a sort of super aerospace company. But Rogozin is much weaker than Manturov and Chemezov, so if Chemezov really wants it, he will ultimately get it.\u201d\n\nDefense chiefs on Trump's list of alleged Putin beneficiaries 1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5\n\nIn an effort to sidestep Rogozin, Manturov has reportedly submitted his latest proposal directly to the Kremlin. This plan, which Kommersant reports is expected to be featured on an upcoming draft presidential decree on the matter, features the merger of United Aircraft with Russian Helicopters \u2014 a Rostec holding. Medvedev has reportedly agreed that a merger of the helicopter and aircraft industries make more sense.\n\nWhen approached by Defense News Thursday, a Russian Helicopters spokesperson said the company has no comment at this time. United Aircraft spokesman Syssoev told Defense News that the company\u2019s official position is that \u201cwe are controlled by our shareholders and as such it is up to them to decide on these matters.\u201d"

Sometimes it is referred as the BREM-84. It is similar to modern Western ARVs. Typical tasks of the Atlet include recovery of damaged or overturned armored vehicles on the battlefield. It also provides maintenance service or tows them to maintenance units. The Atlet ARV was officially accepted to service with the Ukrainian Army in 2008. However only one vehicle was built. This armored recovery vehicle is also proposed for export customers. A small number of these ARVs (BREM-T) have been exported to Thailand. Recently some sources reported that Pakistan ordered 12 of these Ukrainian armored recovery vehicles alongside with 294 Oplot-M main battle tanks for delivery in 2018-2021. The Atlet ARV is based on a modified T-80UD main battle tank chassis. It can be also based on the chassis of more recent Ukrainian Oplot main battle tank. It is fitted with a crane, winch and a front-mounted dozer. Crane of this armored recovery vehicle is hydraulically operated and can lift up to 25 t, which is adequate for most missions. The crane is installed on a rotary platform. It is capable of lifting the turret of most main battle tanks. It is also used to lift powerpacks of the MBTs, or for other load-lifting works. If repairs are required to a vehicle's suspension, the crane raises the front of back of the vehicle to allow access to the damaged system. When not required the crane lays along the right side of the hull. The main mechanical winch is provided with 130 m of cable and has a traction force of 25 t. With the help of pulley blocks traction force is increased to 50 and 75 t. The main winch is used for recovery of damaged, stuck, sunken and overturned vehicles. There is also an auxiliary winch with 260 m of cable and a traction force of 900 kg. It is used for delivery of the main winch rope and other cargo handling operations. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle tows damaged, faulty or uncontrolled vehicles, or similar type tanks using rigid or non-rigid hitches. Vehicles are towed to the nearest shelters, assembly points of repair depots. Vehicle has a welding outfit for welding and cutting works in the field. These are carried by one of the crew member. The Atlet also has a set of tools for field repairs. The front-mounted dozer blade is used for clearing obstacles and earth-mowing works, such as preparation of firing positions, covering up of ditches, self-entrenching and so on. Capacity of earth-mowing works in clay terrain is 120 m\u00b3/h. The dozer blade is also used to stabilize the vehicle during craning and winching operations. The Atlet ARV has a required level of protection to operate alongside the frontline units. Front arc withstands small-caliber projectile hits, while all-round protection is against heavy machine gun fire and artillery shell splinters. Vehicle is fitted with NBC protection and automatic fire suppression systems. This armored recovery vehicle is armed with remotely controlled 12.7 mm machine gun. It is used for self-defense against ground and low-flying air targets. A total of 450 rounds are carried for this machine gun. This armored recovery vehicle has a crew of three, including commander, driver and handler. There is a special cargo platform at the hull rear. It is used to transport spare engine, gearboxes, spare parts, cargo, additional fuel or other equipment with a total weight up to 1.5 t. The Atlet armored recovery vehicle is proposed with two engine options. The basic is a 6TD turbocharged diesel engine, developing 1 000 hp. A more powerful 6TD-2 engine, developing 1 200 hp, is also available. This armored recovery vehicle is also fitted with auxiliary power unit. It ensures operation of the add-on equipment, such as welding equipment, auxiliary winch and other electric equipment of the vehicle, when the main engine is turned off. With a deep wading kit this ARV fords water obstacles up to 5 m deep. When not in use this deep wading kit is stored on top of the roof. The Atlet ARV can be airlifted by the An-124 or similar heavy cargo aircraft. Variants BREM-T is a similar armored recovery vehicle with some minor changes to meet specific Thai Army requirements, such as a different radio, air conditioner and so on. . It was specially developed to meet a Thai Army requirement. It was revealed in 2013. It is based on the Oplot-M chassis and is designed to support these main battle tanks. Thailand ordered a total of 49 Oplot-M tanks and required a dedicated ARV to support them. Can't find what you're looking for?"

    "text": "By Chris Thatcher | February 19, 2019 Chris Thatcher |\n\nEstimated reading time 6 minutes, 12 seconds.\n\nOn Feb. 16, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) accepted the first two of 25 Australian F/A-18A Hornet fighter aircraft at 4 Wing Cold Lake, Alta.\n\nThe federal government is acquiring the 30-year-old jets to fill a capability gap it claims is affecting the RCAF\u2019s ability to simultaneously meet NORAD and NATO obligations. Eighteen of the jets will be brought up to operational standard while seven will be reserved for parts.\n\n\u201cThe interim fighter fleet is key to ensuring the [RCAF] can continue to fulfil their missions and ensure the safety of Canadians and Canada,\u201d said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan in a statement.\n\nThe two aircraft were flown to Cold Lake from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, where they were participating in Exercise Red Flag.\n\nBefore the F-18s can be integrated into the Canadian fleet of CF-188 Hornets, they will undergo several modifications at L-3 MAS in Mirabel, Que., to bring them up to the same operational configuration as the Canadian CF-188 Hornets, including cockpit and communications upgrades, a night vision imaging system, a sniper targeting pod, landing gear modifications, a new ejection seat, and of course the Air Force paint scheme.\n\n\u201cWe will make the necessary investments in these aircraft to ensure they meet the requirements of the [RCAF],\u201d said Carla Qualtrough, Minister for Public Services and Procurement Canada in a statement.\n\nAs part of the reconfiguration, the Australian jets could also see an upgrade to their combat capability. A review by the Air Force is currently underway to assess any necessary improvements to the combat capability of the Canadian Hornet fleet after an Auditor General\u2019s report in November flagged a shortage of pilots and the declining combat capability of the aircraft as the two \u201cbiggest obstacles to meeting the new operational requirement.\u201d The review is expected to be completed by spring 2019.\n\nThe budget to acquire the Australian jets and extend the life of the current fleet of 76 Hornets until a new fighter is procured beginning in the mid 2020s is about $3 billion.\n\nDeliveries of the Australian Hornets will continue at regular intervals for the next three years, with the final aircraft expected by the end of 2021. The jets will be distributed among the tactical fighter squadrons and operational training squadron at 3 Wing Bagotville, Que., and 4 Wing Cold Lake.\n\nThe Liberal government has been criticized for manufacturing the capability gap and unnecessarily acquiring an interim fleet. Patrick Finn, assistant deputy minister for materiel at the Department of National Defence, however, assured a Senate committee in late October that the Australian jets would help the Air Force transition to an eventual replacement fighter.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft will really increase our fleet, and it is not the number of aircraft that counts; it is rather the hours of use in the future,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe are looking for an aircraft that will remain in service for another 14 years. What is needed is enough hours on the structural side. We will be able to use these aircraft until the entire fleet is no longer in service.\u201d\n\nAs the interim capability is introduced, the Air Force is also trying to address the other issue highlighted in the Auditor General\u2019s report\u2013a lack of experienced pilots and maintenance technicians.\n\nMGen Alain Pelletier, chief of the fighter capability project, told an Ottawa conference on defence and security on Feb. 13 that several initiatives were being implemented to retain pilots and technicians.\n\n\u201cGiven that there is a lot of pull out in the commercial marketplace for skilled technicians and pilots, we\u2019re doing our best to retain our folks to actually deliver the capability that is expected of the RCAF,\u201d he said.\n\nIt takes five to seven years to develop a fighter pilot and a frontline technician able to lead a crew at the squadron level, he noted. While new recruitment efforts will help bring more people into the Air Force, they won\u2019t resolve the challenge of having enough experienced people at both the operational squadrons and in the training system.\n\nWithout those experienced people, delivering all the capability outlined in the government\u2019s 2017 defence policy would be a challenge, he said. \u201cWe need the right people with the necessary skills on the squadrons to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t unique to the RCAF. Commodore Steve Waddell, the Royal Canadian Navy\u2019s director general for naval strategic readiness, observed that the military as a whole is competing with the commercial sector for much-needed talent. Most Navy trades, he said, are short about 10 per cent and can be as low as 60 per cent capacity when sailors are on leave, taking professional development courses or otherwise unavailable for active duty.\n\nThe Navy will make greater use of data, artificial intelligence and machine learning to help the workforce \u201cto be more efficient\u201d and reprofile its people to deliver the defence policy, he said."

    "text": "A remote Iranian port could be the next trigger for geopolitical tensions between rivals China and India. India has pledged more than $500 million to develop the strategically located port of Chabahar -- roughly 1,800 kilometers (1,110 miles) from the capital Tehran -- since it first expressed interest in 2003. Yet repeated delays have prompted Iran to turn to China in the hope of speeding up construction.On a March trip to Islamabad , Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said he\u2019d welcome Chinese and Pakistani investment in Chabahar, according to Dawn newspaper. He cited China\u2019s development of Gwadar, a port down the coast that is a showcase of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt-and-Road infrastructure initiative.The shift makes sense for Iran, which wants to ensure Chabahar is an economic success. But it could be a strategic loss for India, which opposes China\u2019s expansion in the Indian Ocean and is already worried that Gwadar could one day be used as a military base -- along with other China-backed ports from Myanmar to Bangladesh to Sri Lanka.Any formal investment from Beijing would further weaken the strategic advantage for New Delhi to invest in Chabahar, which is close to Pakistan\u2019s western border. The Gwadar port is part of Xi\u2019s plan to finance $50 billion in infrastructure investments in Pakistan , and Chinese merchants already have a strong foothold in Chabahar.China\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"Delhi would likely take the view that any Chinese presence at Chabahar, even if not involved in the operation of the port, could be used as a way of undermining India\u2019s influence with local authorities,\" said David Brewster, a senior research fellow with the Australian National University\u2019s National Security College. \"It could also be potentially used to facilitate surveillance of India\u2019s activities.\"While it\u2019s unclear whether China will take up Iran\u2019s offer, the involvement of a cash-rich and expansionist Beijing would almost certainly speed up development of the port.China has overland train connections linking China to Iran and \u201chuge\u201d investments in the country, said Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation think-tank. \"China is much deeper there than India.\"Iran\u2019s invitation to invest was welcomed in Pakistan. \"It\u2019s a positive statement that came for the first time from their side,\" Dostain Khan Jamaldini, chairman of the Gwadar Port Authority, said by phone. The two countries are already discussing a new ferry service that would link ports in Gwadar and Karachi with the Iranian ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas, Jamaldini said.Cooperation between the two ports could be awkward. India and Pakistan are historic foes that have fought several wars, while India and China -- which recently faced off in the Himalayas -- are battling for geopolitical influence in South Asia.Still, for Iran the port\u2019s development is important. It will be a vital trading hub in the Gulf of Oman, said Ebrahim Jamili, head of the Iran-India Chamber of Commerce in Tehran.\"The priority is with the Indians -- they\u2019ve been involved and came forward first,\" Jamili said. \"But if another investor comes along and is interested in Chabahar, there is certainly enough space and opportunity for them and for their investment.\"While there\u2019s been talks on Chinese and Pakistani involvement, Jamili said Pakistan is not a serious contender in terms of investment.India first agreed to help Iran expand Chabahar port in 2003, constructing two terminals -- a multipurpose cargo terminal and a container terminal. Progress slowed particularly as Western nations imposed sanctions on Iran, which were lifted in 2015. Delays have persisted since then, including a two-year dispute over whether India would pay $30 million of excise duties on port equipment imported into Iran.Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Monday construction was going well and both sides were meeting regularly. He was unable to give a completion date.\"Significant progress\" has been made at Chabahar, Kumar said, noting it was Iran\u2019s \"prerogative\" to choose its partners.Cooperation with China would help Iran to relieve its financial situation and promote infrastructure development, said Yang Guang, a researcher on international relations with state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\"China and Iran, as increasingly important economic forces on the international stage, have great potential for cooperation,\u201d Yang said."

Allies routinely conduct maritime surveillance from an Icelandic base, where NATO tracks Russian military movements in the north Atlantic and Arctic.\n\n\u201cYour strategic location in the Atlantic helps to bind North America and Europe together,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\nThe Arctic has emerged as a high-profile security issue for the U.S. and NATO. The concerns stem from melting ice that will eventually open long-closed sea lanes, and a Russian military buildup in the region that could exploit the situation. China also is looking to gain a foothold in the Arctic in what U.S. European Command officials have called an \u201ceconomic charm offensive.\u201d\n\nAdm. James Foggo, head of U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa, said last month that the Arctic \u201cpresents a new challenge for freedom of the seas.\u201d\n\nRussian forces have reoccupied seven former Soviet bases in the Arctic Circle and built other new bases in the region, Foggo said.\n\n\u201cThey have renewed their capabilities in the North Atlantic and are aggressively extending their reach in the Arctic,\u201d Foggo said in a command podcast. \u201cThe improved capability of Russia to project power into this region, from the Northern Sea Route to the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap, is something that we must pay particular attention to.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Iceland, its strategic location has been important for NATO dating back to the Cold War, when U.S. troops were based there. The country also played a large role in hosting allied forces in 2018 when NATO held one of its largest exercises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHowever, despite majority support for membership in Iceland\u2019s parliament, the country\u2019s left-wing prime minister has staked out a rare position as a NATO head of state opposed to alliance membership.\n\n\u201cMy personal position is that we should leave NATO, so I am critical towards any increased militarization of the North Atlantic, but our government will stick to the security policy that we have agreed upon and a part of that policy is our membership of NATO,\u201d Jakobsdottir said in November, as quoted by Arctic Today.\n\nOn Tuesday, she did not address the issue of NATO membership, but said security in the Arctic is in everyone\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cFirstly, we talked about the Arctic, and I think we share concerns,\u201d Jakobsdottir said. \u201cThe Arctic should stay a low-tension zone.\u201d\n\nStoltenberg said institutions like NATO play a role in maintaining order in \u201cuncertain and unpredictable times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to try to continue to work to maintain low tensions in the High North despite the fact that we see more military presence, especially of Russian capabilities, up here,\u201d Stoltenberg said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92019 the Stars and Stripes\n\nVisit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."

    "text": "Rheinmetall and BAE Systems to Create a UK-based Land Systems Joint Venture\n\n(Source: Rheinmetall; issued Jan 21, 2019)\n\nAn aerial photo of the BAE Land Systems facility at Telford, England, which will be taken over by a Rheinmetall-controlled joint venture in which BAE will reduce its holding to 45%, marking another step in the German company\u2019s European expansion. (BAE photo)\n\nRheinmetall and BAE Systems today announced that they have signed an agreement to create a joint UK-based military vehicle design, manufacturing and support business. The new Joint Venture will be headquartered at BAE Systems' facility in Telford, England and will sustain over 400 jobs in the UK, as well as preserve key technology and engineering skills.Rheinmetall will purchase a 55 percent stake in the existing BAE Systems UK based combat vehicles business, with BAE Systems retaining 45 percent. The establishment of the new Joint Venture is subject to regulatory approvals which are anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2019. Once the approvals have been completed, the Joint Venture will be known as Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL).In addition to managing and growing the existing combat vehicle support business, the intent is for the new Joint Venture to play a major role in the delivery of the British Army's new Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) and other strategic combat vehicles programmes.While initially focused on these major UK programmes, RBSL will also form an integral part of Rheinmetall's Vehicle Systems Division and will participate in and contribute to various global military vehicle pursuits and contracts.The combination of Rheinmetall's military vehicles technology and products with the additional capabilities and products brought to the Joint Venture by BAE Systems, such as Trojan, Terrier, Warrior, military bridging and the AS90 self-propelled artillery system will create a European market leader in the military vehicle sector.RBSL will have the potential to create hundreds of additional UK jobs, both in Telford and the wider supply chain.Ben Hudson, global head of Rheinmetall's Vehicle Systems Division said \"We are excited about the potential the new Joint Venture holds for Rheinmetall, BAE Systems and ultimately our customers. The combined capabilities of our two great companies will offer our customers a comprehensive portfolio of military vehicles and associated technologies both now and into the future. We are proud to invest in the UK and expect to substantially grow the current business and the Telford manufacturing facility over the coming years.\"Jennifer Osbaldestin, Managing Director of BAE Systems Land UK business, said \"We are committed to evolving our combat vehicles business so that we better serve our customers' future interests. Joining forces with Rheinmetall in the UK provides renewed purpose for our vehicles business and allows us to deliver products, services and technology that help land forces excel in their vital roles. We look forward to working together to ensure the Joint Venture is a trusted supplier to the British Army and our international customers.\"Rheinmetall Defence is a leading supplier of military vehicles and systems. Rheinmetall's businesses in the UK include Rheinmetall Defence UK (RD UK) and Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles UK (RMMV UK), and are well-established suppliers to the MOD. They support the British military in a number of areas, including vehicle systems, ammunition and technical assistance.BAE Systems has had a combat vehicles manufacturing and support business in the UK for many decades. Under predecessor companies it manufactured and built the Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank and the Warrior, Terrier and prototypes of the BOXER vehicles. The current business helps the MOD and Army maintain and upgrade a range of military vehicles and bridging systems. It employs around 400 people, who are based largely at the company's Telford facility, as well as at sites in Washington, Filton (Bristol) and Bovington.The proposed Joint Venture does not include BAE Systems' munitions and weapons systems businesses or its holding in the CTAI Joint Venture with Nexter.-ends-"

    "text": "Armenia - Military Spending\n\nArmenia's 2015 defense budget is equivalent to only about $500 million. Despite this huge spending disparity, the country has so far been able to largely maintain the military balance with its oil-rich foe. Through bilateral defense agreements with Russia and membership in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), it has long been receiving Russia weapons at knock-down prices or free of charge. This mostly unpublicized military aid appears to have intensified in recent years.\n\nIn particular, Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian-backed army is known to have formed a new tank brigade (which typically consists of around 100 tanks) and received more heavy artillery in 2012. In late 2013, it announced the provision of another 33 Russian-made tanks to its forces. Russia also reportedly delivered 110 armored vehicles and 50 rocket systems to the Armenian military during that period.\n\nArmenia will soon buy more advanced weaponry at domestic Russian prices with a $200 million low-interest loan that was disbursed by Moscow during the \"Electric Yerevan\" protests. Around the same time, the Russian government revealed that it is negotiating with the Armenian side on supplying the latter with state-of-the-art Iskander-M missiles that would significantly boost Armenia's ability to strike Azerbaijan's vital oil and gas installations. The Armenian missile arsenal currently includes Soviet-era Scud-B and Tochka-U systems with firing ranges of 300 and 120 kilometers respectively.\n\nThe military budget was estimated in 1992 at US$33.8 million. Conscripts generally lacked equipment and advanced training, and some units were segregated by social class. Officer elitism and isolation are also problems, chiefly because the first language of many officers is Russian. Desertion rates in 1992\u009793 were extremely high. In early 1994, the defense establishment considered formalizing the status of the large number of volunteers in the army by introducing a contract service system.\n\nThe Karabakh Self-Defense Army consists mostly of Armenians from Karabakh or elsewhere in Azerbaijan, plus some volunteers from Armenia and mercenaries who formerly were Soviet officers. The Karabakh forces reportedly are well armed with Kalashnikov rifles, armor, and heavy artillery, a high percentage of which was captured from Azerbaijani forces or obtained from Soviet occupation troops. Significant arms and materiel support also came from Armenia, often at the expense of the regular army. By 1994 the Karabakh SelfDefense Army was building an infrastructure of barracks, training centers, and repair depots. Defeats that Armenians inflicted on Azerbaijan in 1993 were attributed by experts largely to the self-defense forces, although regular Armenian forces also were involved.\n\nThe war drained Armenia\u0092s economy, and Karabakh politicians and issues seem to dominate in Yerevan\u0092s policy. Lack of investment, increasing military expenses, and population decreases affect the country\u0092s economy. According to Defense Minister Serzh Sarkisyan, Armenia\u0092s defense expenditures ($77.5mil. \u0096 4% of GDP) were increasing at a rate corresponding to the increase of Azerbaijan\u0092s military budget ($114mil. - 2.6% of GDP). Armenia's defense budget was $65 million for 2001; the gross domestic product in 2000 was $1.9 billion.\n\nIn the official state budget, national defense, national security and law enforcement spending in 2004 was 74.7 bln dram (USD 150 million), or 23.6 percent of the budget. Spending on the social sector, (health care education and culture) was 111.7 billion AMD (USD 220 million) or 35.5 percent of the budget. There was debate in Parliament this year after the Minister of Defense objected that defense spending was less than spending on education for the first time. The Ministry of Defense also typically benefits from supplemental spending bills throughout the year as well as off-budget expenditures. A published government decree from June 2004, approved by the Prime Minister and the President, has established a joint stock company with the assets of the bankrupt Armenian Airlines and assigned 100 percent of the shares to the Ministry of Defense. The Ministry now owns Armenian Airlines' old assets: 25 old Aeroflot planes, mostly old Tupolev passenger aircraft, and it was not clear if any deal will be made with the airline's creditors. The government used a similar decree on August 18, 2004 to distribute revenues from Zangezour Copper Molybdenum Plant, Armenia's single most profitable asset to the \"Motherland Military Patriotic Fund.\" The Zangezour Copper Molybdenum Plant is one of Armenia's most valuable assets yet to privatized and one of the few state assets to make a profit. The copper mine was offered in a public tender early in 2004 that attracted USD 132 million bids from an American firm and a German firm. The Ministry of Trade had drawn out the sale and made the deal less likely, not least by insisting on selling both bidders 50 percent of the shares rather than awarding the tender to one bidder.\n\nBoth these cases illustrate a systematic policy of making off-budget transfers to the Ministry of Defense and foundations that it controls. In addition to avoiding the scrutiny of the National Assembly and international observers over military spending, such a mechanism doubtless facilitates opportunities for graft among high-level officials. The government's assignment of Zangezour,s profits suggests that the sale itself, equal to one-fifth of the official state budget, may also be kept off-budget. Indeed, there had been no discussion of how the GOAM intends to spend the USD 132 million in cash it expects to receive from the deal.\n\nThe primary responsibility for auditing the GOAM's military spending lies with the Ministry of Defense's internal auditing mechanism, the Department of Financial Inspection. The Defense Ministry's Department of Financial Inspection conducts internal audits and reports to the Minister of Defense. The framework for the internal auditors is decided annually upon receipt of the Ministry's budget allotment.\n\nSeveral mechanisms exist for significant off-budget spending for defense purposes, including the transfer of state revenues to foundations and the direct sale of state assets. The Ministry of Defense reportedly uses these assets to provide for the defense of Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia claims it does not provide for the defense of the self-proclaimed \"Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh,\" in fact it is common knowledge that it does. Funds for this purpose are not accounted for in public documents and are therefore not subject to independent oversight. Because there is no effective independent oversight of these expenditures, it is widely suspected that senior Ministry of Defense officials take advantage of these off-budget funds for personal use.\n\nUntil 2006, the MOD had pushed hard to use FMF funding to outfit all of its ground troops with Harris radios - the continuation of an FY04 FMF purchase of USD 10 million in radios. Over the course of a series of bilateral meetings with the MOD, the Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC) was able not only to expand FY07 FMF purchases to materiel beyond communications equipment, but to convince the Armenians to use the money to outfit the two units that work closely with U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Kosovo: the 12th Peacekeeping Battalion and the Humanitarian De-Mining Unit.\n\nThe new equipment, which includes uniforms, field equipment and mission-specific equipment for Peacekeeping Battalion platoons, and De-Mining engineer personnel will improve those units' interoperability with U.S., coalition and NATO forces. In obtaining the new equipment, Armenia also will achieve one of the goals listed in its NATO Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP): IPAP 2.3.1; \"create peacekeeping battalion.\" The funding also will provide technical training for the Peacekeeping Battalion's staff, and several of its platoons, and will establish a transition course for new recruits.\n\nOn November 11, the National Assembly approved the 2006 budget which includes a 22 percent increase in public spending funded by continued economic growth, improved tax collection and international donor support. The 2006 budget calls for AMD 482.2 billion (USD 1.15 billion at the projected exchange rate of AMD 420 to the dollar or USD 1.04 billion at the current exchange rate of AMD 463 to the dollar) in expenditures and AMD 412.4 billion (USD 980 million at the projected AMD 420 to the dollar exchange rate) in revenues with a projected deficit of AMD 69.8 billion (USD 166 million at the project exchange rate of AMD 420 to the dollar). The budget emphasizes social spending and there are large increases in expenditures on education and transportation.\n\nIn marked contrast to 2005, there was little debate about the modest increase in official defense spending which is slated to reach AMD 74.1 billion (USD 176 million) in 2006. In previous years this issue had been hotly debated because the Ministry of Defense controls a number of important income generating companies and continues to benefit from significant off-budget revenues. The continuing reliance on off-budget mechanisms to finance military spending keeps the defense portion of the GOAM budget artificially low.\n\nFMF assistance will enable the MOD to increase its peacekeeping and stability platoon contributions to company size units by early 2008. The Armenian MOD is very interested in using FMF and IMET to fully equip the peacekeeping battalion ahead of schedule in 2007, and then to begin to train and equip a second peacekeeping battalion and a brigade staff as a move towards their envisioned peacekeeping brigade. Additional US funding would rapidly enable the MOD to achieve its IPAP goal of turning the peacekeeping battalion into a full brigade, and to increase its peacekeeping and stability platoon contributions to battalions, with an eye toward sending them to Iraq or possibly Afghanistan by 2009. On 01 November 2011, parliament increased Armenia\u0092s 2012 military budget to 150 billion drams (about $400 million) -- the country\u0092s largest annual defense outlay ever. But how the ministry will spend those additional funds is anybody\u0092s guess. Defense spending has long been considered off limits to public scrutiny. Energy-rich Azerbaijan\u0092s military budget stood at a massive $1.76 billion (over 1.38 billion manats) for 2012.\n\nOn 19 November 2014 Azeri Finance Minister Samir Sharifov said, \u0093Azerbaijan\u0092s armed forces need better equipment as Armenia continues its occupation policy in defiance of international law\u0094 and announced that in 2015 Azerbaijan\u0092s defense budget would increase 27 percent to $4.8 billion, 17.9 per cent of the government\u0092s budget expenditures, exceeding Armenia\u0092s total state budget of $3.2 billion. Azerbaijan\u0092s 2014 military budget was $3.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2013 and $3 billion in 2012. In comparison, Armenia\u0092s 2013 defense budget was $447 million.\n\n\n\n"

Siwi Sukma Adji launched on Wednesday auxiliary support vessel KRI Bontang 907 at the PT Batamec shipyard in Batam, Riau Islands.\n\n\u201cThis boat will support the activities of the Navy\u2019s warships, so they no longer have to return to base but can be resupplied in the middle of the sea,\u201d Siwi said.\n\nThe fuelboat will initially be assigned to Natuna waters bordering the South China Sea to support Indonesian warships in the area.\n\nConstruction of the boat started in 2017 and was scheduled to be completed at the end of this year. The boat is 123.5 meters long,16.5 m wide and can carry up to 5,500 cubic m of fuel and 109 special forces crew members.\n\nSiwi added that the KRI Bontang was part of the Navy\u2019s strategic five-year defense development plan and would replace older fuelboats that have been in use for more than 25 years.\n\n\u201cThis boat will strengthen the operations of our warships in the middle of the sea, as the warships will be able to conduct longer operations,\u201d he said.

In February 2017 it emerged that Nigeria had ordered two FPB 110 Mk II coastal patrol vessels. They are 35 metres long and have a maximum speed of 30 knots. They will be fitted with two 12.7 mm machineguns and a 20 mm cannon and a 4.7 metre long Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The weapons will be added in Nigeria. Other equipment includes two Furuno radars and a Vigy Observer electro-optical system.\n\nNigeria\u2019s FPB 110s are based on the models produced for Kuwait, but are driven by propellers and not water jets. They are apparently also more comfortable for the crew, with improved accommodation. The two vessels can accommodate 17 people, including a dozen crew members.\n\nThe boats are powered by two MTU 16V2000 diesel engines giving a top speed of 30 knots and a range of 900 miles with 3-5 day endurance.\n\nOnce delivered, they will be used to improve maritime security off Nigeria, with an emphasis on piracy and maritime crime.\n\nOcea has delivered a number of other vessels to Nigeria, including three 24 metre long FPB 72s in 2012 and a 32 metre FPB 98 Mk II in 2013. Five FPB 72s have been ordered, with two, the Gongola and Calabar, delivered to Nigeria in January this year after the Shiroro and Ose arrived in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother FPB 72 is expected to be delivered to Nigeria in mid-2018."

    "text": "A400M military plane made in Seville. Miguel Angel Morenatti / AP\n\nFor the second year in a row, Spain has shattered its own record for weapons exports. The country sold military equipment worth \u20ac4.3 billion last year, a 7.3% rise from 2016.\n\nThe rise is part of a global increase in weapons transfers that began in the early 2000s, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. According to this analysis, Spain was the seventh-largest exporter of weapons last year.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year\n\nOutside the European Union, which accounts for 72.6% of Spain\u2019s weapons exports, the country\u2019s biggest client was Saudi Arabia with \u20ac270.2 million in sales, a 133% rise from 2016.\n\nThe Spanish government denied permission for four sales last year, including two shipments of equipment worth \u20ac1.9 million that would have gone to Israel. A sale to China and another one to Myanmar also failed to secure authorization.\n\nGermany was Spain\u2019s top client last year, purchasing \u20ac1.2 billion worth of weapons, according to a report filed with Congress by the Office of the Secretary of State for Commerce. Other major clients were Britain, France and Turkey.\n\nIn all of these cases, the bulk of the sales represented aircraft that are assembled at a plant in Seville. These planes account for 79% of Spain\u2019s military exports.\n\nOutside the EU, Saudi Arabia replaced Egypt as Spain\u2019s top client last year, spending \u20ac270.2 million on a carrier aircraft, unmanned aircraft, replacement parts, mortar shells and more.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen in 2015, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled, rising from \u20ac34.7 million in 2016 to \u20ac90.1 million in 2017. In Yemen, Saudi Arabia heads a coalition that\u2019s been accused of crimes against humanity.\n\nEver since Saudi Arabia launched a military operation in Yemen, its purchases of Spanish ammunition have nearly tripled\n\nThe Spanish government said that \u201call licenses relating to ammunition [for Riyadh] came with end-user certificates containing strict clauses forbidding re-export and use outside national territory.\u201d\n\nBut non-profit groups such as Amnesty International, Oxfam Intermon and Greenpeace say that there is no proper monitoring of the final use of these weapons.\n\nIn the Middle East, Iraq is another major client, followed by the United Arab Emirates. In the Maghreb region, Morocco and Tunisia purchased \u20ac14.8 million and \u20ac11.4 million worth of weapons, respectively.\n\nIn Latin America, Venezuela bought military equipment worth \u20ac3.4 million, while Ukraine spent nearly \u20ac231,000 on defense material.\n\nJapan, the United States and Ghana were the biggest recipients of hunting and sporting guns."

    "text": "As the new United Nations General Assembly opens, the world should rapidly turn its attention to the Sea of Azov. The Sea of where? Azov may be little known, but this sizeable north-eastern offshoot of the Black Sea \u2013 encircled by Russia, occupied Crimea, and Ukraine \u2013 could soon be the new frontline in the ongoing war in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Sea of Azov plays host to the key Donbas ports of Mariupol and Berdiansk. Mariupol itself is indeed known across the world: Russian-backed forces seized it in bitter fighting in 2014, but later relinquished it. Mariupol has since become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. But Russia is now increasingly militarising the Sea of Azov in a series of moves that could have implications not only for maritime trade and supplies into Ukraine, but also for the ongoing land war in eastern Ukraine. The UN may soon need to take steps to stabilise the region.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nRussia began asserting itself in Azov in 2015 when it began the construction of a long-anticipated bridge across the Kerch Strait. The bridge stretches from Russia to sovereign Ukrainian territory (eastern Crimea), helping yet more arms, men, and equipment move into Crimea. But Russia also designed the bridge in such a way as to reduce the flow of north-south shipping into and out of Mariupol and Berdiansk. The Kerch bridge is just 33 metres in height, making it impossible for larger ships to pass fully loaded. The strait itself is narrow; even before this, vessels would often have to wait before proceeding through.\n\nThings began moving rapidly over the summer and early autumn. In May, Russian vessels in the Sea of Azov began stopping and delaying shipping, including both Ukrainian vessels and those with flags of third party states, imposing huge waiting costs on all vessels on their way to or from Ukrainian ports. On 17 September Ukraine decided to abrogate the general \u2018Friendship Treaty\u2019 that it signed with Russia in 1997. But this also leaves it potentially more exposed: the Friendship Treaty contained a promise for both sides to respect each other\u2019s borders and territorial integrity \u2013 even if Russia has since broken this promise.\n\nThis is an increasingly volatile situation that could spark a new front in the war between Russia and Ukraine. At the end of August, Ukraine announced the \u201ctransfer of additional forces of the Marine Corps and coastal artillery\u201d to Azov. In total, Ukraine has sent 270 special forces personnel to the Azov and Black Seas. There is also talk of a possible new Ukrainian naval base in the region. On 23 September, Ukraine caught Russia, for once, unawares, and sailed two navy vessels through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov \u2013 a tugboat and the search-and-rescue ship Donbas \u2013 which then headed for Mariupol.\n\nThe status of the sea is subject to several agreements and live legal claims. In 2003 Ukraine and Russia decided to treat Azov as the \u201chistorical internal waters\u201d of both Ukraine and Russia, and to leave the waters undemarcated. Some Ukrainian nationalists are now calling for Ukraine to repudiate the 2003 agreement and make a claim over Azov coastal waters of 12 nautical miles under international maritime law. But this might cede the majority of the sea to Russia and leave Ukraine without access through the strait, as it is unlikely to be unable to enforce a 12-mile claim off Crimea. Ukraine also launched a general UNCLOS case (the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) against Russia in 2016, that claims that Russia has interfered with Ukraine\u2019s \u201crights as the coastal state in maritime zones adjacent to Crimea in the Black Sea, Sea of Azov, and Kerch Strait\u201d.\n\nThe 2003 agreement provides a right to conduct random inspections, but that was never supposed to lead to a general inspection regime, or be the preserve of one country only. Moreover, vessels sailing to or from Russian ports or Rostov-on-Don do not find themselves stopped. Time delays impose considerable financial costs. Turkish vessels are suffering particularly, but Romanian and Bulgarian and many other EU-flagged ships are also experiencing long and costly delays. Russia\u2019s aim is to put off international business in the longer term.\n\nThere is a political backdrop to this too: Petro Poroshenko is standing for re-election in March 2019 on a national security platform, and is taking a tougher line on Azov. Losing Mariupol to Russia again would be a severe blow to Ukrainian morale, at a time when populist opposition candidates, with media support from Russia, are backing a message of \u2018peace\u2019 and \u2018compromise\u2019 in the 2019 elections, including the later parliamentary elections in October.\n\nFrom sea to land\n\nWhat happens here matters for what happens inside Ukraine. Mariupol is the key to maintaining the imports and exports that serve the heavy industry on both sides of the fighting line in Donbas. Remaining economic connections across the frontline would weaken severely. Mariupol may lose viability as a result of these Russian actions, from the impact of the new bridge to Russia\u2019s ramped-up naval activity.\n\nThe Russian maritime threat will force Ukrainian forces to be more cautious about committing soldiers to the current frontline\n\nRussia has redeployed several ships from the Caspian Sea to the Azov Sea (via the Volga and the Don and the canal that links the two), including the corvettes the Grad Sviyazhsk and Velikiy Ustyug. The military threats are many: Russian ships could bombard Ukrainian positions from offshore; they could use long-range Kalibr missiles to strike more or less anywhere within Ukraine; either an amphibious landing or the recent expansion of Russian air-drop facilities could insert troops near or behind the current frontline. It is further possible that Russia may be treating this new operation as a dry run for blockading Ukraine\u2019s other ports, west of Crimea. Most of Ukraine\u2019s exports leave by sea, so a Russian escalation of this approach would be greatly damaging to Ukraine\u2019s economy.\n\nThe most dramatic scenario would be an outflanking operation that surrounded the Ukrainian army in east Ukraine by landing behind it to the west. Ukrainian troops are dug in. Parts of the front are mobile, but some parts resemble the defensive positions of the Western Front in the first world war. The Russian maritime threat will force Ukrainian forces to diversify and be more cautious about committing soldiers and resources to the current frontline. At the very least, Russia is using the Azov operation to pressure Ukraine to loosen its blockade of Crimea, and resume water supplies, but also to promote disillusion and fatigue with a war that is now more than four years old.\n\nEnter the UN?\n\nActions on the ground appear to have rendered the 2003 agreement effectively obsolete, but diplomatic protest from the West so far has been minimal, despite the serious nature and strategic intent behind Russia\u2019s Azov operation and the increasing number of ships with Western flags affected by it. The rapid deployment of a UN Maritime Peacekeeping Operation mission would defuse the situation and maintain the freedom of maritime movement in the region, and help to avert any further escalation.\n\nAs well as ensuring freedom of movement, the mission\u2019s tasks should include monitoring. It should also provide escorts for Ukrainian and other vessels, as well as receive the power to intercept and inspect vessels and to organise incident resolution meetings. A neutral third country with maritime capabilities, such as India, could lead the mission.\n\nSuch a mission would require invitations from Ukraine and Russia. Russia may wield its Security Council veto, but it actually has a long-term interest in reducing tensions, given the expensive infrastructure it is building in the region. Turkey would also be key to any passage of ships through the Bosporus. Discussions about a peacekeeping mission on land for Donbas are currently stuck; a maritime operation would help restart the conversation and bring the UN back into the picture."

    "text": "G\u00d6TTINGEN \u2014 The German armed forces plan to lease advanced Israeli UAVs, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement, she pointed out that the inspector general of the Bundeswehr has decided to rent the drone Heron TP, manufactured by the Israeli company IAI, to protect German soldiers in deployments overseas. The German Army already uses the smaller predecessor drone Heron 1 for years in Afghanistan with good results.\n\nAccording to the minister, the leasing contract is intended to bridge the period until 2025 when a new European combat drone will enter service. Last year, Germany, France, Italy and Spain agreed to build such an UAV. In this project Germany wants to take the lead role.\n\nThe lease of three to five Heron TPs will cost roughly \u20ac600 million (US $650 million), with the deployment's start scheduled for 2018, government sources disclosed. The contract is to be concluded by the end of this year. Apparently, the UAVs are to be stationed initially in Israel for training purposes, but a relocation to an air base in northern Germany is planned in the long run. However, in case of problems with the registration, a deployment in Israel seems to be possible.\n\nHeron TP is considered a MALE drone (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) for reconnaissance tasks and can be armed when needed, which is not possible for Heron 1. The partner for the Bundeswehr is primarily Airbus Defence and Space, the company operates and maintains the aircraft. With the Israeli manufacturer IAI, Airbus has completed a so-called teaming agreement without establishing a new company.\n\nAccording to sources in the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, a major reason for the Heron TP's selection was Israelis' willingness to give Germany a deep insight into the drone's technology . \"All the technical information we might need, was promised to us\", said a well-informed person linked to the Social Democrats of the Bundestag. According to the source, the Israelis also assured that the know-how could be used for the development of a European drone. IAI sees the Bundeswehr as an important reference customer for Heron TP drone, and the state of Israel is backing the deal, the person said. So far this UAV is only in use by the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAnother argument for Heron TP is its significantly faster availability in comparison to a procurement of US model Predator, insiders said. The technical resemblance of Heron 1 and Heron TP should also facilitate the training of operating personnel.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nNevertheless, with the selection of the Israeli aircraft the Bundeswehr goes a special path, as British, French, Italians, Dutch and Spanish opted for US drones produced by General Atomics. In case of problems with logistics, maintenance or operations Germany can't tap resources of European partners.\n\nAccording to media reports, it is currently being discussed to arm the Heron TP with the air-to-ground missile Brimstone from European manufacturer MBDA, which was confirmed by well-informed sources. Britain has used the weapon already in Libya and Iraq. The German Air Force checks apparently procurement of this missile for its Typhoon Eurofighters. However, IAI should have a say in the selection, as the Israelis would have to disclose their interface for the integration of weapons. Brimstone is manufactured by MBDA UK.\n\nAs of November, the Heron 1 UAVs had logged more than 25,000 flight hours in Afghanistan, Airbus announced. In its contracts, the Bundeswehr acquired a guaranteed number of flying hours of this aircraft type from Airbus. In addition to the maintenance, staff from Airbus is responsible even for takeoffs and landings of the Heron 1. A contract for Heron TP could look similar."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nOn March 10, Brunei\u2019s defense ministry officially confirmed the country\u2019s new proposed defense budget for this year. Though the budget allocation does amount to a double-digit hike over the previous year, that hike is worth keeping in perspective given previous drastic cuts to the defense budget as well as lingering economic challenges that the Southeast Asian state continues to face.\n\nAs I have noted before, Brunei\u2019s defense budget has come under growing strain over the past few years due to broader economic challenges. The tiny, oil-rich sultanate is highly dependent on the energy sector \u2013 with oil and gas accounting for over 70 percent of the country\u2019s nominal GDP and almost all of its exports, by one estimate. Declining energy prices have put pressure on government finances, resulting in rising deficits and multiple years of negative growth. The defense budget has been significantly affected, with more modest increases and some large double-digit cuts.\n\nLast week, Brunei\u2019s defense ministry confirmed that the country\u2019s defense budget had been set at just over 492.75 million Brunei dollars (US$375 million). The new figure constitutes an increase of about 12.9 percent over the previous year. And in his remarks to Brunei\u2019s 14th Legislative Council, Brunei\u2019s Minister of Defense II, Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Rtd) Dato Paduka Seri Haji Awang Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, eloquently reiterated the importance of defense in terms of the country\u2019s broader goals, including preserving the country\u2019s security and achieving its much-ballyhooed Wawasan 2035 vision.\n\nYet the hike ought to be kept in perspective. The BN$492.75 million figure is an increase from the previous year but still remains far below the BN$719.15 million figure from 2014 before a couple of drastic cuts. A major cut in 2015 of around 25 percent was followed by a modest increase and then another drastic 20 percent cut the following year. And as I hinted at above, the increasing pressures on the defense budget were also not all visible in terms of an observed decrease in numbers, thanks to shifts in components of the budget and other workarounds.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nOf course, this is not to suggest that this year\u2019s modest increase does not represent a gain or sorts, or that we are seeing a complete overhaul of Brunei\u2019s defense priorities. Indeed, the seven areas that the minister mentioned in his remarks \u2013 protecting its territorial integrity; preserving a high level of preparedness and readiness; supporting a \u201cwhole of nation\u201d approach; conducting effective defense diplomacy; involvement in international missions; sustaining high standards in terms of human resource capacity; and maintaining a respectable and credible image for the country\u2019s defense organization \u2013 were quite familiar.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nBut it is to reinforce the point that the real question, as ever, remains the extent to which Brunei is able to attain these priorities and what tradeoffs it will need to make to ensure that this occurs. The answers to that question have more to do with individual decisions Brunei makes on its own and with its partners, rather than just a statistic about the rises and falls in its defense budgets."

    "text": "While China has opposed the recently announced US Nuclear Posture Review of 2018 it has not been remiss in developing its nuclear arsenal both quantitatively and qualitatively. Towards the end of January China tested a DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile equipped with 10 multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs). This was a quantum jump from the three warheads of the earlier version DF-5B missile.Earlier in November China conducted two flight tests of a new missile DF-17 that was attached to a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV). China has been the first to conduct such tests even though the US and Russia have been working on the same. The HGV can reach a speed of Mach 5 plus speeds thus capable of delivering nuclear warheads at the target in a matter of minutes.While this has implications for the US it would also impact India\u2019s evolving nuclear deterrence capabilities that are being built around boosting its missile defence and strike capabilities.Towards the end of 2017 India conducted its third interceptor missile test to enhance its Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capabilities. On January 18, this was further supplemented by India successfully conducting a pre-induction test of Agni-V intercontinental ballistic missile which has a range of 5000 kilometers. Both tests were designed to develop and strengthen the credibility of India\u2019s nuclear deterrent.The BMD test was part of phase two of the ongoing development of India\u2019s two layered BMD system wherein Advanced Air Defence interceptor missile takes on the incoming ballistic missiles in the endo-atmosphere up to low altitudes of 20 to 40 kilometers. The phase one included testing and development of Prithvi Air Defence Missile (PAD) Interceptor and Prithvi Defence Vehicle (PDV) designed for intercepting enemy missiles at exo-atmospheric high altitudes of 50\u2013150 kilometers. Phase 2 is intended to give India capabilities in the class of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD).The second phase was to be completed by 2016 giving India the technical capability to take on ICBMs with ranges over 5000 kilometers. Apparently, the programme has been somewhat delayed.There has been considerable debate on the value and worth of BMD systems given that such systems can be penetrated by attacking missiles by a variety of means. The missiles are armed with MIRVed warheads enhances the quality of the attack. Similarly, HGVs would be able to confound the BMD systems. Further, low flying Cruise missiles can also penetrate the missile defences though they have limitations of having short ranges.India\u2019s No First Use Doctrine is also a compelling factor to strengthen missile defence capabilities in order to enhance the survivability of its nuclear arsenal. Though there has been some debate on the question of India jettisoning its NFU to overcome the nuclear challenges from Pakistan.China\u2019s evolving BMD capabilities as also technological upgradation of its offensive missiles degrade the value of India\u2019s strategic deterrent against China. While Beijing might avow that their BMD is meant for the U.S. arsenal yet, equally it erodes the value of New Delhi\u2019s nuclear deterrent.If India has to maintain the credibility of minimal nuclear deterrent vis-\u00e0-vis China or for that matter Pakistan then besides strengthening the missile defence India needs to upgrade its strike capabilities. Developing ICBM like AGNI VI with MIRVed warheads is inescapable. While DRDO has been working on developing hypersonic vehicle there have been reports that it may take ten years to conduct a test. Other qualitative improvements of our missiles to beat the adversary\u2019s BMD systems is also an imperative."

    "text": "Author: David H Shinn, George Washington University\n\nDoes China\u2019s growing engagement with Africa represent the replacement of Western influence with a new economic hegemon? Or does China\u2019s influence continue to face huge challenges and is it significantly overstated? The truth is somewhere in between. China has become a major player but much of the commentary about its relationship with Africa is overwrought. While China\u2019s tactics and perhaps even strategy are novel, it is just another major power pursuing its own interests \u2014 much as the United States, France and the United Kingdom are doing.\n\nThe principal non-African actors on the continent want essentially the same thing from the 54 diverse African countries. They all want access to Africa\u2019s oil, minerals and natural resources. They seek maximum political support from African countries in international forums such as the UN General Assembly and World Trade Organization. They want to increase their exports of goods and services to Africa for the purpose of earning foreign exchange. They are anxious to avoid various negative impacts on their interests and nationals, such as terrorist attacks, piracy, narcotics trafficking and international crime.\n\nEach major power may also have one or two unique interests. China seeks diplomatic recognition from two hold outs \u2014 Burkina Faso and Swaziland \u2014 who still recognise Taiwan. The United States depends on access to ports and airports for its military aircrafts and ships. France wants to maintain its cultural and language connections. The United Kingdom takes pride in the 19 African members of its Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nIt is indisputable that China has joined the big leagues in Africa. China has been Africa\u2019s largest trading partner since 2009. It accounts for about 15 per cent of Africa\u2019s trade, though Africa accounts for only about 4 per cent of China\u2019s trade. China is the largest bilateral financier of infrastructure projects in Africa, averaging about US$11.5 billion in infrastructure investment annually over 2012\u201316.\n\nIn recent years, China\u2019s OECD-equivalent aid to Africa has averaged about US$2.5 billion, compared with about US$8 billion from the United States and US$23 billion from the European Union. China\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Africa are estimated to be about US$3 billion annually. This is roughly the same amount flowing from US companies but well below the US$35 billion invested in 2015 by companies in the European Union. China accounts for only about 5 per cent of Africa\u2019s global FDI stock.\n\nIn 2017, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti, where France, the United States, Japan and Italy also have bases. China contributes more personnel to UN peacekeeping operations in Africa \u2014 almost 2,100 \u2014 than any other permanent member of the UN Security Council. China is also the second-largest supplier of major weapons to Africa after Russia.\n\nChina\u2019s growing security links to Africa are driven by the increasing numbers of its nationals \u2014 upwards of 1 million \u2014 who live or work in Africa. But these nationals are subject to attack just like the nationals and interests of many other countries. Overall, both the United States and France are more militarily engaged in Africa than is China. Since 2008, China has contributed two frigates and a supply ship to anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden \u2014 but so have many other countries.\n\nOne important but little-understood link is the cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and African ruling parties. There are frequent exchanges of delegations going both directions. The CCP provides cadre training and occasionally material support for African parties. Its relationship with the ruling parties in South Africa and Ethiopia is particularly strong. US political parties have no similar relationship, and even most European political parties collaborate far less with African parties than does the CCP.\n\nThe biggest difference between Western countries\u2019 and China\u2019s approach to Africa concerns liberal democracy and human rights. The West attaches importance to these concepts and even puts conditions revolving around them on its assistance to certain African countries. China eschews this practice and emphasises that it does not attach political conditions to its aid (except for insistence on the \u2018One China\u2019 principle). China\u2019s approach is welcomed almost unanimously by African governments \u2014 especially the more authoritarian ones \u2014 but is not appreciated by many African civil society organisations.\n\nThe divergent political ideologies represented by China and the West complicate their ability to cooperate in Africa. Going forward, China\u2019s regime may pose an additional challenge for the expansion of ties in Africa, particularly with the more democratic African governments. A case in point is press freedom. In 2018, China ranked lower than every country in Africa, except Eritrea, in the Reporters without Borders\u2019 press freedom index (the index ranked 180 countries, including 53 in Africa). At some point, increasing numbers of African governments may start asking themselves what kind of democracy is best for them: China\u2019s or the West\u2019s.\n\nDavid H Shinn is an Adjunct Professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University."

    "text": "VERSAILLES, France \u2015 France is to double its order for the Light VBMR reconnaissance vehicle, a key element in the French Army\u2019s \u20ac10 billion (U.S. $12 billion) Scorpion modernization program.\n\nAn additional 420 Light VBMR units are to be ordered, taking the total to 978, according to Erwan, the director of the Scorpion modernization program at Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement procurement office. Erwan, whose last name is not used for security reasons, spoke to the press May 16.\n\nA first delivery of the Light VBMR is due in 2022, with 489 shipped by 2025.\n\nIn addition to the highly equipped 489, there will be a further 200 units ordered, with the latter more lightly equipped units, according to the annex of the draft multiyear military budget law for 2019-2025.\n\nThat raises the total of Light VBMRs to 689 delivered by 2025.\n\nAfter 2025 and out to 2032, there will be a further 978 ordered for Scorpion, and 1,060 ordered outside of the program, with a total of 2,038 for that period.\n\nA first delivery of an armored personnel carrier version of Light VBMR is due in 2021, a reconnaissance model in 2022 and a communications variant in 2023.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nA wide spectrum of missions will be covered, as there will be 16 versions of the vehicle, with 10 of the APC, two for recon and four for comms.\n\nNexter will design, build and service the vehicles, while Texelis will supply the chassis and driveline.\n\nNexter\u2019s factory at Roanne, central France, will build the Light VBMR, adding to the workload generated by orders for the Griffon troop carrier and the Jaguar combat and reconnaissance vehicle.\n\nThe Light VBMR weighs 15-17 tons, can reach a speed of 100 kph and has a range of 600 kilometers. That weight compares to the French Army\u2019s initial requirement for a 10-ton vehicle, before industry called that unrealistic.\n\nOne of the vehicles can be airlifted on a C-130, while two can fit on the A400M transport aircraft. Regarding the latter, the vehicles can be fully equipped for combat and still be successfully loaded.\n\nThe vehicle is armed with a remote controlled 7.62mm machine gun, a minigun at the rear and self-protection with a Galix smoke dispenser.\n\nThe vehicle can carry 10 people \u2015 eight troops, a driver and a gunner.\n\nFrance is also to order an upgrade for 200 Leclerc main battle tanks, with a first delivery of a modernized tank in 2021, Erwan said. Sensors and the Bull SICS battle management system, or Scorpion Information Communication System, will bring the tank into the Scorpion\u2019s so-called collaborative combat concept, which seeks to heighten teamwork on the ground and with commanders at the regimental level.\n\nAn order for the Griffon multipurpose troop carrier is to be raised to \u201da target\u201c of 1,872, up 150 units from a previous total, Erwan said. A first delivery is due by the end of the year, with certification in the second quarter of 2019. Some 936 units are due by 2025.\n\nContracts for those increased orders are expected to be signed later this year after the French Parliament formally adopts the draft military budget law, expected in July.\n\nThat boost in orders follows the Army\u2019s call for a speedy introduction of the new armored vehicles, to replace an aging fleet of VAB troop carriers. There is a 2,700-strong fleet of VABs, which are some 40 years old."

    "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - Just one day after signing a $233 million agreement to sell 16 helicopters to the Philippines, the Canadian government on Wednesday ordered a review of the deal amid concerns the aircraft could be used to fight rebels.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Canada's Minister of international trade Francois-Philippe Champagne speaks during an interview with Reuters in Danang, Vietnam November 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jorge Silva\n\nTrade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that the deal - formally signed on Tuesday - had been struck in 2012 on the understanding the helicopters would be used for search-and-rescue missions.\n\nPhilippine Major-General Restituto Padilla, military chief of plans, told Reuters on Tuesday the helicopters would be used for the military\u2019s internal security operations, adding they could also be deployed in search-and-rescue and disaster relief operations.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw that declaration ... we immediately launched a review with the relevant authorities. And we will obviously review the facts and take the right decision,\u201d Champagne told reporters, without giving more details.\n\nThe Bell 412EPI helicopters were due be delivered early next year as the Philippine military prepares to step up operations against Islamist and communist rebels.\n\nPhilippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana initially expressed bemusement at news of Canada reviewing the deal.\n\nHe later issued a statement that the helicopters would primarily be used for the transporting and supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers and for humanitarian assistance and disaster response.\n\n\u201cThey are not attack or close support aircraft,\u201d Lorenzana said. \u201cWhile they may be used in support of Internal Security Operations ... their role is limited to those that I mentioned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShould the Canadian government choose to discontinue their sale of the aircraft to us, then we will procure them from another source.\u201d\n\nCLEAR REGULATIONS\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, asked later whether he was concerned the helicopters might be used against Filipino citizens, replied \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nCanada has very clear regulations about to whom it can sell weapons and how they can be used, he said during a question and answer event at the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure before this deal or any other deal goes through that we are abiding by the rules ... that Canadian governments have to follow,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte publicly criticized Trudeau at a regional summit in Manila for raising questions about his war on drugs, calling it an \u201cofficial insult\u201d, adding that he \u201cwould not answer to any other bullshit, especially (from) foreigners\u201d.\n\nNearly 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in the campaign since June 2016. Human rights groups accuse police of carrying out illegal killings, staging crime scenes and falsifying reports, a charge they deny.\n\n\u201cHuman rights is a key element of our foreign policy and of our trade policy,\u201d said Champagne.\n\nIn 2016, the Liberal government was criticized for deciding to honor a contract to sell light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite human rights concerns. Like the helicopter contract, the deal had been arranged by Canada\u2019s former Conservative administration.\n\nPhilippine defense ministry spokesman, Arsenio Andolong, said it was \u201cunfair to equate internal security operations in general with human rights violations\u201d or to cast judgment on the military when allegations were unverified.\n\nHe did not specify what the allegations or violations were, or who had made them."

    "text": "Government of Trinidad & Tobago Announces Future Acquisition of Two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats\n\n(Source: Austal; issued July 29, 2018)\n\nAustal Limited (Austal) is pleased to report that the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) has announced its intention to purchase two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats. The vessels will enhance the border protection capabilities of the country in conjunction with the existing Coast Guard fleet, and will join six Austal Fast Patrol Craft acquired in 2009.\n\n\n\nThis announcement is further to a comprehensive proposal submitted by Austal to GORTT in recent weeks. The sale is likely to be supported by the Australian Government via the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), and follows a demonstration by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) of the capabilities of the Cape Class vessel to a delegation of senior Trinidad and Tobago officials, which included the Chief of Defence Staff.\n\n\n\nThe order is likely to be valued at circa AU$100m plus a multi-year ongoing maintenance and support package. Austal expects to establish a Service Centre in Trinidad to support these vessels, the Austal supplied Fast Patrol Craft, and any additional vessels requiring maintenance as determined by GORTT.\n\n\n\nThe new Cape Class vessels will be built in Austal\u2019s Henderson shipyard based in Western Australia. Austal have already built 10 Cape Class vessels in Henderson for the Australian Border Force and RAN. Delivery is expected to be in mid-2020.\n\n\n\nDesigned and built by Austal, the Cape Class is a 58 metre all aluminium monohull patrol boat specifically produced to combat the full range of maritime security threats. The vessel has a long 4000 nautical mile range and 28-day patrol cycle with a crew of up to 22. The vessel also supports two high speed 7.3 metre Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats used for intercepting other vessels.\n\n\n\nGORTT have requested that the purchase be supported by an EFIC finance package which will be developed specifically to support the program, for which EFIC have already supplied a letter of support. The sale of the vessels is conditional on final contracts being signed in the coming weeks, together with a conclusive offer from EFIC to GORTT. It is expected that an initial, lower value design contract will be signed shortly to hasten preparations for the main contract and ensure that the delivery schedule will be maintained.\n\n\n\nThese vessels will be the latest additions to the work already scheduled in the Henderson facility, including a 109 metre catamaran for Molslinjen of Denmark, 21 Pacific Patrol Boats (PPB), currently in build, and a 117 metre trimaran for Fred Olsen S.A. of the Canary Islands which will commence construction in August 2018.\n\n\n\nThese additional build programs will keep the local workforce active at the current level until 2021 (2023 for PPB), one of the longest forward order books seen at Austal for a decade or more.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "Russia has maintained its arms exports portfolio despite pressure from external sources, Russian officials have said, and the volume of sales should rise in the future.\n\nSpeaking to Zvezda TV at the ARMY-2019 military exhibition, the head of the Federal Service for Military and Technical Cooperation, Dmitry Shugayev, said on Tuesday, \u201cWe all know well under which pressure Russia is, especially its defense industry. It is important to stress that our partners are also under very strong pressure and this is an example of unfair competition, as there are attempts to oust us from traditional markets and prevent us from entering new markets.\u201d\n\nRussia has said that its annual arms exports usually amount to around $15 billion. Commenting on the figure, Shugayev added, \u201cNevertheless, we are retaining this level of $15 billion and will be keeping it and increasing it, doing everything possible for that.\u201d\n\nParticularly following alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Washington has sought to tighten the screws on Russia\u2019s defense industry through sanctions, such as the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, as well as diplomatic and political pressure on third-party countries that import Russian arms.\n\nThe most high-profile example of the U.S. pressure campaign is the ongoing spat between Washington and Ankara over the S-400, a Russian surface-to-air missile system that Turkey purchased and expects to begin receiving in July. The U.S. has warned Turkey that the buy will result in economic sanctions and also Turkey\u2019s ejection from the F-35 fighter jet program. Washington is also warning India, another prospective S-400 buyer, against acquiring the system.\n\nBesides pressuring foreign countries, the U.S. is also looking to incentivize the purchase of American-made weapons by offering financial assistance to countries that switch from importing from Russia to importing from the United States.\n\nShugayev emphasized that the measures have not deterred Russia. \u201cThe sanctions have failed to push through the main task of ousting Russia from the world arms market and they have also failed to make our partners turn away from us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Russia \u201cconfidently hold[s] the second place\u201d in weapons sales by countries. Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov said that Russia currently occupies a share of around 20 percent of the world\u2019s arms trade. While that figure can be difficult to verify, the international organization SIPRI recently identified Russia as having a share of about 21 percent, behind only the United States.\n\nAs part of its bid to boost arms sales, Russia is devising a new strategy of military-technical cooperation with foreign partners, Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this week. He noted, \u201cWith an eye to ensure the efficiency of our activities in the sphere of military technical cooperation with foreign countries, a draft strategy of military technical cooperation has been elaborated. It envisages coordinated measures of political-and-diplomatic, financial-and-economic and technical nature.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin added that the strategy should account for \u201cnew factors\u201d that create challenges, such as \u201ctougher competition and the aggressive use of unfair methods of political blackmailing and sanctions,\u201d referring to the U.S. efforts to inhibit Russian arms sales."

Scheduled for delivery later this year from Sikorsky\u2019s PZL Mielec manufacturing facility in Poland, the twin turboprop aircraft will significantly enhance the Army\u2019s multi-role transport capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe M28 aircraft\u2019s unique flight and performance attributes are ideally suited for Ecuador\u2019s diverse climate and terrain,\u201d said Adam Schierholz, Sikorsky regional executive for Latin America. \u201cWe are providing Ecuador a proven platform that will accomplish a wide range of national security missions. With the ability to operate from any type of runway or airstrip inaccessible by other airplanes, and to fly in extreme environmental conditions without decreasing payload, the M28 brings formidable capabilities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis powerful and tough aircraft has the highest useful load in its class, is easily maintained in the field, and frequently is preferred to larger platforms because of its multi-mission flexibility and cost-effective performance,\u201d said Janusz Zakr\u0119cki, PZL Mielec president and general director, who attended the aircraft signing ceremony held recently in Quito. \u201cWe are very pleased that the Ecuadorian Army has chosen this platform.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 7,500 kg (16,500 lbs.) M28 airplane can be outfitted with 19 passenger seats, carry up to 2,300 kg (5,000 lbs.) of cargo, and conduct parachuting missions from the cabin\u2019s rear clamshell doors.\n\n\n\nAfter a pilot and mechanic training course in Poland, a PZL crew will fly the aircraft across the North Atlantic Ocean to Shell Mera, Ecuador, via Iceland, Greenland, Canada, the United States and Central America.\n\n\n\nEcuador is the first Latin American country to acquire an M28 aircraft following a two-month demonstration tour of seven Caribbean and Latin America countries in 2017. Flown by two PZL pilots, the touring aircraft demonstrated landings at two remote Ecuador airfields last April \u2014 a 600m (1,968 feet) gravel runway and a 530m (1,738 feet) gravel/grass runway \u2014 with 11 passengers on board.\n\n\n\nSikorsky has received requests for proposals from commercial operators and militaries in Latin America as a result of the tour. A majority of the proposals seek to carry passengers and/or cargo into unprepared landing strips at sea level and high altitude locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "Asia Sentinel ran this piece looking at Burma's military in December 2006. It is sadly even more relevant today Fueled by the sale of energy and timber, a pariah nation seeks weapons to keep its enslaved people in line Locked into a bunker mentality, believing Burma is under siege from insurgents, determined to hold onto power and fueled by profits from looting its forests and fossil fuel energy production, Burma\u2019s junta is buying arms faster than ever. There are plenty of eager sellers even to pariah states if they have the money. In the latest turn of events, General Thura Shwe Mann, Burmese Army chief of staff, is suspected of sealing a deal for Indian military equipment when he visited India\u2019s Eastern Command earlier in December. Indian spokesman, Wing Commander R K Das, would only confirm they discussed joint exercises and training. That trip followed a meeting between Air Chief Marshal S P Tyagi, commander of the Indian Air Force and Senior General Than Shwe, head of the military junta, in Naypyidaw, the new capital of Burma, on 22 November. Human Rights Watch claims Mr Tyagi was there to offer light attack helicopters, better avionics for combat jets, and naval surveillance aircraft. On what terms is unclear, but reports say New Delhi is hoping to persuade Rangoon to finally get tough with Indian rebels using Burma as a base to battle for the independence of states in troubled northeastern India. Burma is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries yet it has an army four times larger than that fielded by Britain, the world\u2019s fifth richest country. Shouldering all those rifles and manning armored vehicles are at least 400,000 Burmese troops, double the size of neighboring Thailand\u2019s army. Burma\u2019s military, the Tatmadaw, is actively recruiting for a force of 500,000 troops. Indeed given how many soldiers Burma has, the military arguably does not have enough heavy weapons. The Tatmadaw\u2019s modernization follows the footsteps of China, evolving from a peasant army to a heavy conventional force. \u201cAfter decades of being essentially a small, lightly-armed infantry force geared to regime protection and counter-insurgency, the Tatmadaw is gradually becoming an integrated force capable of more conventional, large-scale territorial defense operations,\u201d wrote Andrew Selth, one of a few analysts closely watching the Burmese military, in a research paper. Selth estimates that about 35 percent of the government budget, mostly raised from trade taxes and printing money, goes to the Tatmadaw, or about $240 million in 2005 based on a Central Intelligence Agency government expenditure estimate of $716.6 million. However that is only half the picture because the military trades on its own account through firms such as the Union of Myanmar Economic Corporation and the Myanmar Economic Corporation. \u201cThese function in some ways like the Indonesian military corporates in adding to \u2018defense\u2019 resources. So however it\u2019s measured, Burma\u2019s defense spending will likely always be grossly understated,\u201d says Sean Turnell, a Macquarie University economist studying Burma. Those sums are peanuts compared to what America, Japan or Singapore spend, but go a long way with the low prices offered by the likes of China, Russia and Ukraine. Furthermore, some weapons and supplies are bought through barter arrangements or come as gifts, usually nuts and bolts items like trucks, from China. In addition, as much as one million cubic meters of logs worth an estimated US$250 million are being sold illegally to China, destroying vast and sensitive areas of virgin forest, according to the international watchdog organization Global Witness. The arms purchases suggest a grave external threat. Yet what that might be is hard to fathom. The state-controlled press has in recent years warned of an American invasion, ordering troops, militia and the public to take heart from Iraq and prepare for guerrilla resistance. An American-led attack to topple the junta is nothing but a fevered dream in the imagination of a few dissidents. Given the debacle in Iraq it is even more unthinkable today. Nonetheless, \u201cBurma has been at war ever since independence was granted in 1948, in large part due to the desire of the combatants to control access to (its) natural resources,\u201d according to Global Witness. \u201cSince independence there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths among both combatants and non-combatants. War-related displacement has led to 300,000 refugees, in official camps, in neighboring countries and one million internally displaced people in Burma.\u201d Closer to home relations with neighbors \u2013 Bangladesh, India, China \u2013 are cordial. Relations with Bangkok improved markedly when Thaksin Shinawatra became prime minister of Thailand in 2001. After a rocky start and some border skirmishes, Thaksin focused relations on business. Despite an official withdrawal of support for insurgents and a clampdown on refugees, suspicions remain in Rangoon.\n\n\n\n\u201cGeneral Than Shwe said in meetings that Thailand is our enemy, I don\u2019t know why he thinks like this, he always thinks Thailand supports the insurgency because in the past we support them as a buffer state. But now we change policy, but the Burmese army still thinks about the past,\u201d says a Thai military intelligence source in Bangkok. That is not entirely surprising given heavy smuggling and trade across the porous border, including supplies ordered by remaining insurgents in Mon, Karen and Shan states from Thai merchants. Thailand\u2019s traditionally close cooperation with America also keeps doubts smoldering in Rangoon. Moreover General Surayud Chulanont, installed as Thailand\u2019s prime minister after a coup in September, is no fan of the junta. In addition to the Indians, South Korean firms have been in hot water lately, accused by public prosecutors in Seoul of illegally supplying equipment and helping to build an artillery munitions factory worth $133.8 million in Burma. Cases are now being prepared against 14 executives from seven firms, including Lee Tae-yong, president of Daewoo International. These dealings, though significant, pale compared to previous contracts. Highlights include 1,000 BTR-3U infantry fighting vehicles based on an old Soviet design, which Burma ordered from Ukraine in 2003. Their capabilities are roughly equal to the American Bradleys or British Warriors now on duty in Iraq. Supporting those troop transports are 139 Soviet-designed T-72 main battle tanks, packing a hefty 125mm cannon. Less capable are around 600 Chinese copies of earlier Soviet tanks. These tanks and fighting vehicles are backed up by a few hundred 155mm long-range heavy artillery guns, plus thousands of light guns, mortars, rockets and anti-aircraft missiles. Burma\u2019s navy is also expanding, buying small combat vessels from China to complement ships being built in yards near Rangoon. Electronics and weapons come from the usual scrum of suppliers based in China, Russia, North Korea, India, Israel, and say some reports, Italy. Above those ships and tanks Burma\u2019s air force flies at least a dozen Russian MiG 29s, among the world\u2019s best combat aircraft, along with dozens of older make-do Chinese fighters, plus dozens of simple but tough Polish and Russian multi-purpose helicopters adept at moving troops or attacking with machine guns and rockets. Though Burma\u2019s best kit comes from Russia and Ukraine, its primary supplier remains China. Jared Genser, a visiting fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy, testified to the US-China Economic and Security Review Committee in Washington in August 2006 that China has provided 90 percent of the Burmese military\u2019s equipment in two deals since 1989. \u201cWithout China\u2019s $1.6 billion in military assistance and naval modernization, Burma would not have been able to create the second largest military, behind Vietnam, in Southeast Asia,\u201d said Genser. Burma is also expanding its arms industry. In addition to small warships, arsenals are designing and producing assault rifles and mortars. They are also assembling some of the BTR-3 fighting vehicles from Ukraine. Despite all this weaponry, insurgents are the only active threat facing the regime, a mixture of ethnic nationalists, rebel Burmese, and opium and methamphetamine warlords. But these ragtag armies are far weaker than they were during the 1980s, cut down by attrition, bickering and sweet deals from Rangoon. Burma\u2019s military has forced many to ceasefires or into mountain redoubts using infantry and artillery, rarely risking its expensive attack jets or gunships. With the rebels on the run, friendly neighbors and America bogged down elsewhere has no grave threat. Tomorrow might be rather different. What the generals do fear, of course, is a sudden uprising of the kind that nearly toppled the regime in 1988. Given the isolation and suppression of its people, the generals live in a hostile land with every reason to behave like an occupying army. If they are going to hang on indefinitely to the milking cow they have made of the country, the generals must constantly peer into the future to seek clues for potential missions. One of those will doubtless be securing the infrastructure which will earn large revenues from oil, gas and transportation, some of which will doubtless pay for more combat aircraft, warships and armored vehicles. China\u2019s official media reported in April that preparations were underway for a $2 billion gas pipeline from Sittwe, where offshore oil and gas is brought ashore, to Kunming in Yunnan, which followed an understanding reached between PetroChina and Rangoon in December 2005. That pipeline will run through parts of the Shan State that have in the past been controlled by rebel armies and are still within striking distance of groups pressed up against the Thai border. A parallel oil pipeline is a distinct possibility. China is also negotiating transit rights for trade across Burma via road, rail and river that will run along the same corridor as the pipelines to Andaman Sea ports. Protecting and patrolling this lucrative infrastructure is one mission where fighting vehicles and even tanks could be useful in deterring fading guerrillas and reassuring China. They may also provide security for onshore oil fields, which seem set to expand on the back of exploration wells drilled by Chinese firms. It is a similar story offshore where Burmese, Chinese, Korean and Indian firms are investing heavily in substantial oil and gas fields. Their security, principally against pirates, requires warships and surveillance aircraft, but that alone cannot justify the ongoing naval expansion. All the same these emerging missions to counter low-grade threats fail to justify the junta\u2019s enthusiasm for spending huge sums on military equipment, especially when public health and education are in a woeful state, neglected for decades. \u201cIn practice, the military\u2019s perceived domestic political-security imperative has resulted in a multi-pronged approach to force ethnic insurgents to subscribe to the unitary state in which the military retains a major role. Equally, the imperative has obligated the military to fight off internal and external challenges to its rule and authority,\u201d wrote the London School of Economics\u2019 J\u00fcrgen Haacke, in a study of Burma\u2019s foreign policy earlier this year. America\u2019s push to pressure the regime through the UN does nothing to dispel this paranoia. Moreover, the junta worldview is an antique from another era, in which military strength was a symbol of state prowess, a way to inch Burma up the regional pecking order. A huge military impresses upon the Burmese themselves that protest is futile. They have lowered the guns on their people before, in 1988, and they could do so again with even more devastating effect. \u201cIn Burma they think they need a strong army to control the people. We still believe that who controls the army controls the weapons, controls the people. The poor people still respect the man who has a uniform, who is a soldier,\u201d says the Thai military intelligence source, a veteran of the Thai-Burma border. The chance of a repeat of the 1988 uprising, when thousands were killed by soldiers shipped in to Rangoon for the task, seem remote. Recruiting impressionable young men into the army also helps soak up the unemployed, who might otherwise fall in with the idea of fighting for change. Impressive as this military machine sounds, its effectiveness may not match the image. Morale is low in many units. They often have to farm their own food, or requisition from local villages. Training and discipline are wanting in many units, reports of troops stealing, raping and murdering are commonplace. Maintenance, especially of hi-tech Russian jets or low-quality Chinese equipment, almost certainly presents problems. \u201cI think they lack the logistics and maintenance, they think only about the capability of the weapon, they don\u2019t think about how long they will have it, how to maintain it. If you have a good maintenance and logistics systems then you can fight for a long time, but if you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t,\u201d says the Thai military intelligence source.\n\nSubscribe to this comment's feed Show/Hide comments Show/Hide comment form\n\n"

According to the information we presently have at hand, those helicopters are not U.S.-made, but rather manufactured by a number of states with an American license,\u201d the spokesman said, adding they were intended for non-military use.\n\nTouching upon the recent Azerbaijani provocations along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, in the direction of Nakhichevan, Mr Balayan noted that the country acts upon the principle of irresponsibility, failing to fulfil the commitments undertaken by it.\n\n\u201cWe keep voicing this issue both before the [OSCE Minsk Group] co-chairing countries and our remaining partner states and organizations. I believe the co-chairs have a serious work to do here since Azerbaijan disregards the co-chairing countries by ignoring their calls and doing completely the opposite,\u201d he added."

    "text": "LONDON \u2015 Britain\u2019s defense secretary has put at least a \u00a33 billion-a-year (U.S. $4 billion) price tag on the value of the country\u2019s close military relationship with the US, but conceded that the arrangement was priceless to the government.\n\n\u201cWe benefit massively from our relationship with the U.S. I said you couldn\u2019t actually put a price on it, but when you look at [it] in terms of the benefits we get on a yearly basis I think we would benefit to the tune of a very minimum of \u00a33 billion, and that is taking a very conservative approach,\u201d Gavin Williamson told the parliamentary Defence Committee on Tuesday.\n\nWilliamson said the benefits came in \u201cterms of technology, in terms of joint programs working together. Quite frankly we would always struggle to put that level of investment into a program if we wanted to bring it to fruition, so we are a massive beneficiary of this relationship.\u201d\n\nThe remarks come as the committee concluded an inquiry into British relations with the U.S. and NATO. The findings of the report are expected to be published in the next few months.\n\nThe defense secretary earlier in the day announced the Ministry of Defence had on May 21 hosted a meeting with the U.S. Defense Innovation Board in London aimed at sharing, among other things, innovation priorities.\n\nBritain\u2019s relationship with the U.S. could take a serious hit, however, should media reports from last week prove true \u2015 that London is considering cutting its pledge to buy 138 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets and instead purchase more of the cheaper Eurofighter Typhoons as part of its defense review, officially known as the Defence Modernisation Programme.\n\nOne British newspaper described the possible move as \u201can epic snub\u201d to Washington.\n\nWilliamson also announced Britain\u2019s investment in the creation of what will be called the AI Lab \u2015 a defense center for artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science based at the MoD\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory facility in Porton Down, southwest England.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nWith the cash-strapped MoD expected to publish the defense review ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels scheduled for July 11, lawmakers wanted to know whether Washington had voiced an opinion about British defense spending.\n\nWilliamson said the U.S. Defense Department and others in the states had contributed to the defense review, but the subject of money hadn\u2019t been on the agenda formally or informally.\n\n\u201cWhat they have asked is to make sure we have the right capabilities. But we have not had a discussion about defense spending. ... They have put a very high value on the capabilities we have, and they would be very concerned to see that capability eroded,\u201d Williamson told the committee.\n\nThe defense secretary specifically noted \u201cmassive ticket items that the U.S. sees as pivotal for the defense and security of NATO members\u201d:\n\nRapid deployment of troops as part of NATO.\n\nSpecial forces.\n\nThe new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier battle group.\n\n\n\nThe nuclear deterrent.\n\n\n\nCountering the uptick in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic.\n\n\n\nWilliamson also mentioned the Royal Navy\u2019s mine-hunting capabilities and said Britain is a world leader in terms of technological development done in partnership with the U.S., asserting that in some cases the U.S. is further behind Britain.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, senior U.S. military and diplomatic figures voiced concern over Britain\u2019s declining defense capabilities as spending slipped close to falling below the NATO-set spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cThey [the U.S. administration] recognize that our commitment to 2 percent is something to be praised and is an important signal to other European nations to be spending at that same level,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nEarlier this month, Woody Johnson, the U.S. ambassador in London, urged Britain to increase its defense spending.\n\n\n\nThe Defence Modernisation Programme is meant to prioritize British capabilities and programs, in part to reflect the rapidly changing threat posed by Russia and others since the Strategic Defence and Security Review was published in 2015.\n\nThe MoD, which is facing a multibillion pound black hole in the defense equipment and other budgets over the next few years, will have to find significant cuts from efficiency gains and other measures to balance the books. The department is also fighting for more money from the Treasury to stave off cuts.\n\nDefense funding problems took a new knock Tuesday when the National Audit Office, a government-spending watchdog, warned that the program to design, build and support nuclear submarines over the next 10 years faces a \u00a36 billion funding gap."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nOn May 26, the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will complete three years in office in India. This is a good time to evaluate the performance of the government including its foreign policy \u2013 just after it has completed half its tenure, and just before it starts gearing up for the next general election.\n\nThe Modi government\u2019s achievements need to be seen in light of the fact that traditionally New Delhi has never publicly asserted \u2013 and arguably, never set for itself \u2013 the hierarchy of long-, medium-, and short-term goals of foreign policy and the instruments to achieve these. Occasionally, some governments have laid down strategy \u2013 for example, PV Narsimha Rao\u2019s \u201cLook East\u201d Policy, IK Gujral\u2019s \u201cGujral Doctrine,\u201d or AB Vajpayee\u2019s vision on nuclear policy \u2013 but an Indian \u201cgrand strategy\u201d has remained conspicuous for its absence. Consequently, Indian foreign policy has often been reactive.\n\nEven the Modi government\u2019s foreign policy was not always proactive during its first year in office. Over time, however, the Modi government has captured the imperatives of geoeconomics and begun laying down a strategic geoeconomic vision for India. While any clear statement of goals and instruments is still absent, the strategic vision can be discerned from some of the Modi government\u2019s policy initiatives. This vision is rooted in India\u2019s concerns over trade, energy security, and the \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative.\n\nOne important pillar of Modi\u2019s foreign policy geoeconomics is the policy of \u201cneighborhood first.\u201d Since the unprecedented invitation by Modi for leaders from South Asia and Mauritius to attend his swearing in ceremony in May 2014, India has strengthened and continued to build its ties with South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations. This year on May 5, India launched the \u201cSouth Asia Satellite\u201d with an aim to boost communication services and disaster support in the region. Except for Pakistan, which refused to participate in the project, the launch was cheered by all South Asian nations. The Modi government\u2019s emphasis on regional connectivity is also manifest through a trilateral agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of Chabahar port, as well as the launch of the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) Transport Network.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nIndia\u2019s relations with Bangladesh are better today than any time in the past; relations with Bhutan and Sri Lanka are also extremely good. The Modi government has made an agreement with Bangladesh for better connectivity between the northeastern states and the Indian mainland. Thus, bus routes linking Kolkata to Agartala and Shilong via Dhaka have started. Again with the exception of Pakistan, relations with which remain strained due to political and security reasons, India\u2019s proactive diplomacy in the immediate neighborhood has been by and large successful.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe Look East Policy, which has been an important facet of India\u2019s foreign policy since the 1990s, was upgraded by the Modi government to Act East in 2014. This second pillar of Modi\u2019s strategic geoeconomic vision is quite closely related to the first. Act East focuses on strengthening ties with the extended neighborhood, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Under the Modi government, India has strengthened strategic partnerships with countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and Singapore. The share of India\u2019s bilateral trade with ASEAN countries is now almost 10 percent of India\u2019s total trade.\n\nConnectivity is an important facet of Act East, just as it is for India\u2019s neighborhood policy. The northeastern states are the gateways of land connectivity to Southeast Asia. However, poor infrastructure and insurgency have been hindrances to road connectivity in the region. Despite this, India\u2019s trade with Myanmar through the northeast corridor has increased by 86 percent between 2013-14 and 2015-16.\n\nA third important pillar of the Modi government\u2019s strategic geoeconomic vision \u2013 again, closely related to the first two \u2013 is the emphasis on India\u2019s maritime role. Thus, the government has launched Sagarmala, a project that envisages developing a series of ports on both sides of India\u2019s coast. The region has gained importance because of India\u2019s location at the center of global maritime trade routes. India\u2019s foreign policy in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) received renewed impetus with the setting up of a separate IOR Division under the Ministry of External Affairs in January 2016. The Modi government has strengthened relations with Seychelles and Maldives and launched Project Mausam, a project with soft influence in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, for the first time, a clear geoeconomic strategy is evolving in New Delhi that emphasizes the primacy of the IOR and India\u2019s role as an Indian Ocean regional power. However, the glass is only half full, because the geoeconomic strategy needs to be supplemented by a clear strategic geopolitical vision. The Modi government has yet to do that.\n\nIn the third year of its tenure, the Modi government faces some tough challenges: an unpredictable United States and an aggressive China, volatile U.S.-Russia relations, and closer Russia-China ties. In the 21st century, Indian policy has taken turns between bandwagoning with the United States and maintaining a balance between Washington and Beijing. It is time to assert India\u2019s own role as a major player in international politics, and to lead rather than being led. To achieve this, it is very important to lay down a clear geopolitical strategy. It is also time for India to take a firm position on the political-military implications of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nWhen foreign policy is driven by the bureaucracy, it tends to be reactive. During the last couple of years, the Modi government has shown it has the political will to drive foreign policy. This has been reflected in India\u2019s geoeconomic endeavors. If the government goes a step further, it can also reflect it its own vision for geopolitics.\n\nUttara Sahasrabuddhe is Professor of International Relations in the University of Mumbai.

    "text": "Turkey won\u2019t strike a deal on purchasing American-made Patriot air defense missile systems if the US ties it with tearing up the existing arms contract with Moscow, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.\n\n\u201cThe S-400 deal has already been finalized. We can agree with the US on the Patriot system, but not if there will be [a condition] to abandon the S-400s,\u201d the minister stated on Thursday, as quoted by NTV.\n\nAlso on rt.com US tells Turkey to give up on Russian S-400s in exchange for Patriot systems deal \u2013 report\n\nTurkish media reported earlier that the contract presented by the Americans says the missiles will only be delivered if Ankara abandons the S-400 purchase.\n\nThe US Department of State approved the sale of 80 Patriot missiles and 60 PAC-3 missile interceptors last month. Cavusoglu confirmed that Ankara received a formal proposal to buy the weapons and will consider the terms. But in no way should Washington attempt to meddle in the nation\u2019s arms deals with other partners, the minister warned.\n\nNATO allies can get whatever air defense systems they want.\n\nThe deal to buy Russia\u2019s advanced S-400 air defense missile system was signed by Ankara last year following lengthy negotiations. The first batch of S-400s is scheduled to be deployed in October.\n\nAlerted by the Russian-Turkish talks, officials in Washington unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade its ally from dealing with Moscow. Last year, Congress passed a law effectively blocking the shipment of 100 F-35 jet fighters to Turkey. Lawmakers cited the risks that the sale of S-400s poses to the US and NATO.\n\nUS diplomats and military officials similarly tried to pressure India out of buying the S-400 as the transaction could potentially violate American laws on sanctions placed on Russia. According to local media, Washington even proposed granting New Delhi a free pass on receiving arms from Moscow if it also buys the US\u2019 F-16 aircraft.\n\nDespite pressure from overseas, Turkey and India maintained that they can freely choose partners in the arms trade without interference from Washington or anybody else. \u201cWe don\u2019t need permission from anybody\u201d to purchase the S-400s, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in September.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?

    "text": "This acquisition along with the most recent purchase of twelve supersonic radar equipped South African Denel Cheetah fighter jets increased Draken\u2019s fleet size to over 150 fighter aircraft.\n\nDraken International, a global leader in advanced adversary air services, has signed an agreement with Paramount Aerospace Systems, a subsidiary of Paramount Group, for the overhaul and ongoing engineering support of their recently acquired fleet of Mirage F1M aircraft from the Spanish Air Force.\n\nDraken acquired 22 Mirage F1M and F1B fighter jets in an effort to enhance adversary services for its US Department of Defense and allied nation customers. The Mirage F1Ms were predominantly flown by the Spanish Air Force and received a full radar and avionics suite modernization in the late 1990s. This acquisition along with the most recent purchase of twelve supersonic radar equipped South African Denel Cheetah fighter jets increased Draken\u2019s fleet size to over 150 fighter aircraft.\n\nWith the completion of the procurement phase, the Mirage F1Ms will now undergo reassembly, restoration and airworthiness certification by Paramount Aerospace Systems at Draken\u2019s Lakeland, FL maintenance facility. Paramount Aerospace specializes in the modernization of fixed wing platforms including leading the previous modernization of the Mirage F1M while still in Spanish Air Force military service. Paramount possesses extensive capabilities on the Mirage F1 with full airframe and engine overhaul capability, as well as the ability to upgrade and modernize avionics and mission systems.\n\n\"We are looking forward to working with one of the few companies in the world that possesses the extensive depth of F1 experience and knowledge that Paramount brings to the table. We are especially confident given Paramount's experience modernizing the same Mirage F1M jets we now own when they were in prior Spanish Air Force service,\" said Jared Isaacman, CEO of Draken International. Draken\u2019s core competency is its ability to acquire, regenerate, modernize and operate affordable, supportable, credible and capable fighter aircraft. This is demonstrated by the over 150 fighter aircraft Draken has acquired in the last 6 years and the numerous government contracts being supported in the United States DoD and abroad. Draken also remains dedicated to tracking and evaluating aircraft globally with proven success operating fleets of aircraft that include the Mirage F1M, Denel Cheetah, A-4 Skyhawk, L-159 Honey Badger and Aermacchi MB-339.\n\nParamount Group acquired the entire South African Mirage F1 fleet, along with spares, simulators, training aids and other related material. The Mirage F1 represents an ideal solution for low cost Super Sonic Fighter capability, and Paramount offers a complete air-power package, with full training and technical support for the aircraft. Paramount also operates a fighter aircraft pilot training Academy in South Africa, the only one of its kind on the African continent.\n\nIvor Ichikowitz, Group Chairman of Paramount Group said, \u201cWe are extremely excited by the partnership with Draken International and the establishment of long-term relationships in support of the US Air Force. There are very strong synergies between our organizations in meeting the ever-increasing demand for the effective utilization of legacy aircraft in adversary training. Our collaboration with Draken underlines the importance of strategic partnerships for providing flexible, scalable and affordable solutions for the US Air Force.\u201d\n\nAbout Draken International\n\nDraken International is the world\u2019s largest operator of ex-military aircraft. The company is based out of Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, FL. The organization sets a new standard in airborne adversary support, flight training, threat simulation, electronic warfare support, aerial refueling, research, testing, as well as other missions uniquely suited to their fleet of aircraft.

China became the first foreign client for these anti-aircraft systems. In June 2016, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov reported that the Chinese army would receive the systems not earlier than in 2018.\n\nThe S-400 Triumf is a Russian long-and mid-range anti-aircraft missile system designed to hit attack and reconnaissance aircraft (including aerial vehicles based on stealth technology) and any other air targets under conditions of intensive enemy fire and electronic countermeasures."

At a signing ceremony at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Defence Ministers from Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway celebrated Belgium\u2019s official accession to this effort.\n\nThe initiative has been supported by NATO and the European Union. It is an example of effective cooperation between the two organizations when delivering critical capabilities for its members.\n\nDeputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller said: \u201cIncreasing our ability to keep our planes flying - for longer periods and farther distances - has a direct bearing on our ability to defend our citizens and our territories.\u201d\n\nThe project was launched in July 2016 through an order of two Airbus A330 MRTT aircraft by the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and has expanded steadily. With Belgium joining, the multinational fleet will now grow to eight aircraft, which are scheduled for delivery between 2020 and 2024. The aircraft can be configured for air-to-air refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, as well as medical evacuation missions. The multinational fleet will be operated from a Main Operating Base in Eindhoven (Netherlands) and a Forward Operating Base in Cologne (Germany).\n\nThis multinational fleet arrangement will substantially increase European capacity in air-to-air refueling and reduce the over-reliance on the United States in this area. It remains open to other participants."

    "text": "Concerns raised by an opposition member of parliament that Latvia paid too much for the purchase of a large number of used military vehicles from the United Kingdom have been passed to Latvia's dedicated anti-corruption force.\n\nSaeima deputy Andrejs Elksnins of the opposition Harmony party posted images on Twitter of a letter he had received from the Prosecutor General's office saying his concerns had been passed to the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB).\n\nBru\u0146utransportieru 252milj EUR iepirkumu un armijas mehaniz\u0101cijas projektu p\u0101rbaud\u012bs KNAB pic.twitter.com/TOW4LFWN3e \u2014 Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161 (@AndrejsElksnins) August 30, 2016\n\nShortly afterwards he tweeted another letter, this time from the State Auditor, apparently informing him that any probe that agency had launched into the purchase was secret.\n\nValsts kontroles atbilde par bru\u0146utranportieru iepirkumu ir slepena! Iepaz\u012bstoties, saprotams k\u0101p\u0113c! Ir probl\u0113mas! pic.twitter.com/lFKAGE1pTw \u2014 Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161 (@AndrejsElksnins) August 30, 2016\n\nElksnins has demanded to know why the cost of buying 123 used armored vehicles has ballooned from a basic purchase price agreed in 2012 of \u20ac50 million to more than \u20ac250 million after they have been upgraded and fully equipped.\n\nThe CVR(T), or Alvis Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) platform is now four decades old. According to manufacturer BAE Systems, which also has the contract to modernize Latvia's vehicles, 23 countries have bought a total of 3,500 of the vehicles since 1972.\n\nAn interesting history of the vehicles and details of some previous purchasers is found at the Army Guide website.\n\nWith Latvia due to increase its defense spending to NATO's recommended minimum level of 2% of GDP by 2018, more money is certainly going to be spent on procurement, with a corresponding need for scrutiny to make sure it is being spent in the most efficient way.\n\nThe deal has come under fresh scrutiny after Lithuania last week announced its largest ever defense purchase: \u20ac386 million to buy 88 brand new German 'Boxer' armored fighting vehicles.\n\nIf you fancy some military hardware of your own, the British Ministry of Defense has plenty of pre-loved vehicles available at bargain prices - though to collectors rather than allied powers needing rapid mechanization and combat capability."

    "text": "Britain\u2019s last permanent foothold in the Far East plays an important role for British interests in the region amidst growing tensions over the South China Sea.\n\nThe relations between the United Kingdom and Brunei still strong even after the last gained its independence from Britain on 1 January 1984. On the same day signalling the future good relations towards the UK Brunei became the 49th member of the Commonwealth. Since the independence, British forces have been stationed there at the request of the current Sultan, in an agreement renewed at every five years.\n\nThe British taxpayer should not worry about the costs of upkeep. The Sultan, equipped with substantial revenues of Brunei\u2019s gas and oil reserves, pays for the British military presence of about 1,000 soldiers in the country, thus demonstrating that Britain has been seen as one of the closest allies of the small and oil-rich country.\n\nSpanning 2,226 square miles the relative small sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo is the home of the British Forces Brunei (BFB). Since the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, the garrison in Brunei is Britain\u2019s last remaining military base in the Far East and has become one of the three bases \u201cEast of Suez\u201d, alongside the new HMS Juffair in Bahrain, that is reported to be large enough to accommodate Type 45 Destroyers and Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, and Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory strategically situated halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia.\n\nThe British military presence in Brunei is focused on a Light Infantry Battalion. This force compromises one of the two battalions of the Royal Gurkha Rifles. This battalion located in Brunei operates as the British Army\u2019s acclimatised Far East reserve and when needed is available for overseas deployments with other elements of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force as, for example, the Battalion has been deployed to places as far as Sierra Leone and East Timor.\n\nThe Infantry is supported by a small number of garrison troops who are permanently stationed in the country and provides all necessary logistic and administrative support. Besides, alongside the Royal Gurkha Rifles, a Bell 212 Helicopter Flight of the Army Air Corps operates as support and in training missions as part of the British Military Garrison Brunei.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Defence, \u201cthe climate of Brunei is well suited to jungle operations, and the Training Team Brunei run jungle warfare courses for all members of the British Army\u201d. Therefore, the importance of the Training Team Brunei relies on the fact that it is the Army\u2019s jungle warfare school running a variable number of courses, \u201cranging from Jungle Warfare Instructor Courses to long range patrolling and tracking\u201d essential to enhance the military capabilities of the Army in operations overseas.\n\nThe great importance of the British Army presence in Brunei is that its geographic location puts Britain\u2019s military reach far beyond the Suez Canal and enables better management of possible crises in the region. It\u2019s relevant and crucial to British interests in having a reliable ally and a significant military outpost and related facilities in these times of growing tensions amidst the great powers and the countries of the region involved in the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. This issue has been a headache for almost every nation in this region in the last few years.\n\nThis growing tensions mixed with the strong relations between the UK and Brunei has made the Asian country to show great enthusiasm for the constant British military presence and indeed sees Britain as its biggest European ally to count on if necessities arise.\n\nThereby, Brunei is an important ally of the UK in the region and along with Malaysia and Singapore plays an extremely relevant role in support of the British forces in the area. Even more important is the friendly position of the Sultan towards successive British governments since the days of the British protectorate over Brunei seeing that the Sultan is the greatest authority in the country.\n\nSo despite the distance from Britain and apparent irrelevance in maintaining permanent forces in one relatively small nation, the commitments with Brunei play a larger part in determining the strength of the UK than it seems. This role occurs especially because of vast possibilities in training the British Forces in the jungle warfare and thus widening their range of action.\n\nAnother important point that makes it so relevant is the geographic position of Brunei, as Singapore once was back in the days of the Empire an important port for the Royal Navy and British merchants, the small country plays a similar role in what concerns to be the last British permanent outpost in the old Far East."

The eight, collectively valued at R268 969 122, are the forerunners of the Badger, the SA Army\u2019s new infantry fighting vehicle being built by Denel Land Systems.\n\nAs far as heavy weapons are concerned the report notes the import of 16 cannon, worth R19 989 941, from Switzerland; 12 84 mm weapons, worth R4 867 196, from the Peoples Republic of China; 46 grenade launchers (R183 847) from the United States and two Swiss sniper rifles (R167 015).\n\nFrom China, the import of 13 missile launchers worth R1.2 million was approved, as well as two missile launchers from the United States worth R1.3 million. A single mortar system was acquired from Spain, for R362 000.\n\nOn the ammunition front South Africa imported thousands of rounds ranging in calibre from 40mm to 338, 30mm and 7.62 mm as well as 400 specialist rounds for sniper rifles. All told the value of ammunition is over R186 million. The majority of this was for 21 000 rounds of 40 mm ammunition from Bulgaria, worth R175 million. Other large ammunition contracts were awarded to Norway (2 000 30 mm rounds worth R8 million) and Switzerland (1 000 20 mm rounds worth R1.3 million).\n\nOther imports noted in the report include five simulators from Switzerland (R2.4 million); communications equipment from Germany (R69 million); communications equipment from the United States (R65 million); and cameras, thermal imagers and other optics from France, Belgium, Canada and Germany worth a total of R48 million. The 51 thermal imagers from France (worth R46 million) were probably for the Badger infantry fighting vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, the NCACC granted 2 245 import permits from 74 countries in the 2016 calendar year. For the 2015 calendar year, the NCACC authorised 2 249 import permits covering 74 countries worth R502 million. This compares to R200 million in 2014.\n\n"

The event was attended also by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Sumangala Dias, members of the Air Force Board of Management and other officers as well as representatives of the Aviation Engineering Division of the M/S CATIC of China, who are partnering the SLAF in this technology transfer project.\n\n\n\nThe Aircraft Overhaul Wing was established at the beginning of the year 2016 with the technical assistance of M/S CATIC. The Chinese specialist are expected to assist and guide the SLAF in establishing the facilities and in the first few overhauls, after which they are expected to withdraw gradually, leaving the SLAF with the capability to independently handle overhauls. Initially the project is expected to handle the airframe overhaul of Chinese origin aircraft although the SLAF expects that the technology acquired will facilitate the overhaul of other aircraft as well.\n\n\n\nThe concept of Technology transfer is a common practice in most countries where foreign origin aircraft are inducted and used over a period of time. The practice permits the user nation to ensure longevity of the platforms that they acquire without having to rely on foreign assistance and having to dispatch aircraft overseas at great expense in terms of both money and time. While the process of technology transfer requires an initial capital overlay, it is justified by the return on investment over the lifetime of the aircraft fleet. At the same time, the process and facilities such as this also help increase the level of competence of the Aircraft industry of the nation as well and creates opportunities for the technicians engaged in such enterprises to obtain gainful employment even after their retirement from Military Service.\n\n"

    "text": "WASHINGTON: Army acquisition chief Bruce Jette has formally approved full-rate production of the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) \u2014 months after the decision was originally expected \u2014 in a major vote of confidence for the contentious program.\n\nThe armored off-road truck is intended to combine a massive MRAP (Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected) vehicle\u2019s protection against roadside bombs with an unarmored Humvee\u2019s cross-country mobility. That combination is critical in counterinsurgency, but it\u2019s a much lower priority for high-intensity armored warfare with Russia or long-range missile duels with China.\n\nArmy Secretary Mark Esper has publicly said JLTV was designed to defeat guerrillas, at a time when the Army is refocusing on great powers. Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy has confirmed an $800 million cut in JLTV purchases, which translates to at least 1,500 vehicles, over the next five years. The roll-out of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) vehicles has also been marred by teething troubles ranging from stuck doors to maintenance shortfalls to one young soldier managing to total his new truck within 72 hours.\n\nBut the Army still plans to buy about 50,000 JLTVs in the long run, and the Marines over 9,000. The service has even added JLTV to its elite list of 31 top-priority programs \u2014 a portfolio otherwise focused on high-tech heavy weapons for major wars like hypersonic missiles, high-speed aircraft, and a replacement for the tank-like M2 Bradley troop carrier. (The 31 are in turn grouped into six major categories, the so-called Big Six).\n\nThe number of priority programs wavered for months before the Army settled on a list that included JLTV. \u201cWe kind of say \u201930-ish\u2019 because occasionally something will be important enough ewe want to move it into that [list], and then sometimes we move them back,\u201d said Jette, assistant secretary for acquisition, logistics, and technology, at a recent Association of the US Army forum. \u201cJLTV for example is normally not one of those programs, but we had some changes we wanted to make for it, so there we moved it from not in the 30-ish to the 30-ish.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the kind of language normally associated with Pentagon funding plans \u2014 \u201cish\u201d has no official definition in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS). But it shows the flexibility the Army is trying to retain, rather than rigidly pin its hopes to an unchanging list of projects as it did during the Future Combat Systems debacle. It also shows the service\u2019s ambivalence regarding JLTV.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely true that JLTV arose from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, when truck-mounted support units not equipped for heavy combat became prime targets for guerrilla attacks. Humvees proved lethally vulnerable to improvised landmines (aka IEDs), but the heavier MRAP trucks had such poor off-road mobility that they couldn\u2019t bypass roadside bombs. In fact, the winning design, by Oshkosh, is a slimmed-down, refined version of that company\u2019s M-ATV, the MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle, an earlier attempt to combine heavy protection with cross-country performance.\n\nBut counterinsurgency isn\u2019t the only kind of conflict in which truck-mounted support troops are much more vulnerable than they were in 20th Century wars. Islamist irregulars with roadside bombs can erase the once-clear distinction between the front line and the relatively safe rear, but so can the modern Russian military with its extensive use of drones, long-range precision rockets, artillery-launched land mines, and guerrilla proxies. While heavy armored war machines like the Next Generation Combat Vehicle would bear the brunt of a major war and probably deserve the first shot at funding, there\u2019s a role for the JLTV in great power conflict as well."

    "text": "Uttar Pradesh is set to receive a defence industrial corridor projected to attract an investment of Rs20,000 crore. According to a Business Standard report , the Yogi Adityanath government expects defence manufacturing to be one of the key drivers of industrialization in the state. The problem is, without a coherent manufacturing and acquisition policy from the defence ministry or the central government, achieving that objective will be tough.\n\nThe Union defence ministry is increasingly falling short of funds. So much so that some fear that the fast rising allowances and pension costs are crimping funds for modernization and capital spending, the key drivers for local defence manufacturing. The accompanying chart says it all.\n\nFor instance, in the recent Union budget, less than 10% of the incremental hike in defence allocation went to fund modernization, shows an analysis by Laxman Kumar Behera, research fellow at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). \u201cThe share of pay and allowances and pension in the ministry of defence allocation has been increasing consistently since the mid-2010s. A large part of this increase has come at the cost of the modernisation budget, which now accounts for less than one-fifth of the ministry of defence\u2019s total allocation, down from a high of 26%,\" Behera said in a note. \u201cThis is highly undesirable and needs to be corrected at the earliest for the sake of India\u2019s robust defence preparedness.\"\n\nTo be sure, given the limited government resources, the Adityanath government can bank on the private sector to build the defence industry. But there are shortcomings here too. Despite the government\u2019s good intentions, domestic defence manufacturing has not taken off in a big way. In fact, a section of the private sector is beginning to tone down its expectations, reflective in another Business Standard report which says that a UK defence industry body which represents over a thousand defence firms is shutting its India office.\n\nThe lack of a long-term defence procurement plan and ill-advised conditions such as technology transfer in a stipulated time frame hampered defence sector development in India, says Yellapu Santosh, senior research analyst (institutional equities) at IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd.\n\nAccording to IDSA\u2019s Behera, the paucity of contracts has been a big dampener. \u201cIn defence you only have one customer. You produce against an order or an assurance (which is lacking),\" he says.\n\nBehera says the government should have a two-pronged strategy. One is to fast-track contracts and the tender-awarding process. The second set of measures involves a policy push where the government should bring out Indian industry-specific tenders with time-bound awards (contracts for local production). Incentives for defence investments, such as tax incentives or benefits awarded to infrastructure sectors like power, are also needed. It is only then that the private sector will be encouraged to invest.\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nShare Via"

In a joint statement issued at the time, it was specified that \u201cthe ships will be built by the French high-tech company, Naval Group, in partnership with Abu Dhabi Ship Building Company (ADSB).\u201d\n\nThe contract is significant for Naval Group, given it has never sold anything to the UAE.\n\nThe Gowind corvettes are powered by engines made by Germany\u2019s MTU, meaning Berlin could make the contract difficult to honor. The government is not delivering licenses to export military materiel to either Saudi Arabia or the UAE over their involvement in the war in Yemen and the resulting humanitarian crisis there.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s 2,700-ton corvettes will be equipped with Naval Group\u2019s SETIS combat management system, MBDA\u2019s Exocet missile and Raytheon\u2019s Evolved Seasparrow Missile. It was initially announced that Abu Dhabi would procure the Thales Tacticos combat management system.\n\nThe Emirates News Agency, WAM, interviewed Naval Group CEO Herv\u00e9 Guillou in February during the IDEX 2019 defense conference in Abu Dhabi, and it quoted him as saying that \u201csince the announcement of the deal in 2017, we have been discussing with the UAE authorities to take into account their specific requirements and to provide them with the best answer to their operational need.\u201d\n\nAccording to WAM, the executive also said that \u201cin the frame of the program, Naval Group envisions to transfer technologies and know-how to UAE institutions and to the naval ecosystem, thus developing national sovereign capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

    "text": "Senegal and the Ivory Coast are buying CN235 and NC-212 aircraft from PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) for transport and maritime surveillance duties.\n\nA framework agreement was signed last week during the Indonesia-Africa Forum held in Indonesia between 10 and 11 April. The agreement is worth $75 million and covers the supply of two NC-212-200 maritime surveillance aircraft and a CN235-220 maritime patrol aircraft to Senegal and a CN235-220 to the Ivory Coast for transport.\n\nThe agreement was signed with Belgian company AD Trade Belgium, which is facilitating the deals with Senegal and the Ivory Coast.\n\nPTDI (Indonesian Aerospace) President Director Elfien Goentoro said \u201cthe African market is promising, as it comprises several countries. Geographically, African countries and Indonesia have similarities, so they need several light and medium turboprop aircraft.\u201d\n\nGoentoro said the contracts will be firmed up in July this year and the aircraft delivered in two and a half years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cWe are offering countries in Africa the development of human resource skills and knowledge in the aircraft manufacturing industry,\u201d Goentoro added, saying there are opportunities for African countries regarding upgrades, modifications and maintenance and overhaul of CN235 and NC212 aircraft.\n\nIn December 2016 PTDI delivered a CN235-220 transport aircraft to Senegal\u2019s Air Force. It was ordered in November 2014 via AD Trade Belgium. The aircraft is in a quick change configuration that allows it to be used for paratrooping, medical evacuation, VIP and passenger transport missions.\n\nThis was followed by Senegal\u2019s order in August 2017 for a single CN235-220 for maritime patrol, again through AD Trade Belgium.\n\nBurkina Faso and Guinea have also ordered CN235s \u2013 the Burkina Faso deal for two CN235s was facilitated by PTDI and AD Trade Belgium. Guinea\u2019s single CN235 was acquired from Senegal, which had previously acquired two second-hand aircraft from Indonesia.\n\nPTDI said its maritime patrol aircraft are able to carry out a wide range of missions, such as border patrol, Exclusive Economic Zone monitoring, fisheries policing, pollution monitoring, search and rescue and combating human trafficking and drug smuggling.\n\nThe aircraft CN235-220 MPA variant has an endurance of 10-11 hours and features a more modern full-glass avionics cockpit system, autopilot, and winglets for better performance and economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CN235-220 MPA aircraft can be fitted with a 360-degree search radar that can detect small targets up to 200 nautical miles away, forward-looking infrared as well as an Automatic Identification System (AIS), and automatic tracking system."

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nA Parliamentary panel is concerned about India\u2019s declining defence expenditure \u2014 which is at 1.56% of GDP in 2017-18, down from 2.6% in 2014-15 \u2014 and said the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d in a two-front war.\n\nNew Delhi: A parliamentary committee has taken exception to the low defence expenditure in India, noting that, in the current geo-political scenario, the country \u201ccannot afford complacency\u201d on the question of preparedness for a two-front war.\n\nIt has also expressed concern about the slow rate of increase in indigenisation in the defence sector, and noted that \u201cnothing concrete has been done for implementation of the strategic partnership model\u201d unveiled in May last year.\n\nThese observations are part of the estimates committee\u2019s draft report on \u2018Preparedness of Armed Forces: Defence Production and Procurement\u2019.\n\nMembers of Parliament privy to the deliberations told ThePrint that the committee, headed by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi, is perturbed about the fact that India\u2019s defence expenditure, at 1.56 per cent of the GDP in 2017-18 \u2014 down from 2.6 per cent in 2014-15 \u2014 is at its lowest since the 1962 Sino-Indian war.\n\nFrom the data made available to the committee, it was found that defence expenditure had marginally increased since 2014-15, but when compared to the central government\u2019s expenditures, the percentage decreased from 13.15 in 2014-15 to 12.2 in 2017-18.\n\nAccording to a study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which conducts research on global security, the defence expenditure, as a share of the GDP, of China and France had remained the same, increased in case of Saudi Arabia and Russia and decreased in case of the US and the UK in the last decade (2007-2017).\n\nHowever, the estimates committee says in its draft report, keeping in view the scale of GDP of the developed countries, the decrease of India\u2019s defence expenditure as a percentage of the GDP is \u201cmore noticeable\u201d.\n\n\u2018Allocations unacceptable\u2019\n\nThe estimates committee is also \u201cunhappy\u201d about the \u201cabysmally low\u201d share of capital expenditure as a percentage of the total defence spend, which has been continuously declining over the years \u2014 from 39 per cent in 2013-14 to 33 per cent in 2017-18.\n\n\u201cWhat is more worrisome is the situation whereby the procurement has to be adjusted as per the budgetary allocations made by the government, which are not in keeping with the requirements projected as per the long-term integrated perspective plan (LTIPP)\u2026\u201d an MP told ThePrint.\n\n\u201cThe committee finds the present situation unacceptable whereby the allocations are not being made according to the LTIPP, thereby defeating the purpose of having long-term defence plans,\u201d the MP said.\n\nBefore finalising the report, the panel is likely to call the defence minister for deposition, the MP added.\n\nIn 2014-15 and 2015-16, the allocations made at the budgetary-estimates stage consistently got reduced at the revised-estimates level and even the reduced allocations could not be utilised fully. The committee members were, therefore, \u201cnot able to appreciate\u201d the remarks of the secretary, defence acquisition, during the course of deposition that \u201cthey hear from the department of defence that the requirement of the forces is very high and the fund allocation to that extent is not there\u201d.\n\nWhere\u2019s the PPP?\n\nAccording to another MP, the committee is likely to recommend that defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) be given \u201cadequate autonomy and resources\u201d to enable them to operate on commercial basis and sell their products to global customers without depending on the government.\n\n\u201cIn case of conflict, the demands of the national armed forces have to be given primacy,\u201d the committee is learnt to have said in its draft report.\n\nNotwithstanding the government\u2019s constant refrain about public-private partnership in defence, the committee, said a member, has found that \u201cthere is no existing mechanism\u201d to facilitate it in the defence sector.\n\n\u201cThe strategic-partnership model formulated for defence production does not specify a clear role for major defence PSUs. There seems to be a total lack of coordination among government agencies insofar as integrated approach to public-private partnership in defence sector is concerned,\u201d said another member, quoting from the report.\n\nDRDO hauled up\n\nIn its draft report, the committee has come down heavily on the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), saying it has \u201cnot been able to meet the nation\u2019s expectation\u201d.\n\nIn 2015, the Comptroller & Auditor General of India reported that 14 mission-mode projects carried out by DRDO laboratories had failed to achieve their timelines and the probable date of completion was extended many a time.\n\nThese mission-mode projects pertained to the S-band surveillance system, Rohini radars, secure video and fax communication between airborne platforms and ground station Meghdoot and electronic warfare suit for the modified MiG-29 fighters.\n\nA high-powered defence committee said that at least 11 laboratories of the DRDO need to be closed down. The estimates committee has pointed out in its draft report that the functioning of DRDO needs a major overhaul and its contribution in the context of the country\u2019s requirements needs to be re-examined.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 The French government must seek U.S. authorization before selling French Scalp cruise missiles with American components to Egypt, said Eric Trappier, chairman and CEO of Dassault Aviation.\n\nThose U.S. parts on the long-range weapon are critical to its ability to function.\n\nEgypt is in talks with France on exercising an option for 12 Rafale fighter jets, business website La Tribune reported. That option was included in a 2015 contract for 24 twin-jet fighters and weapons from Safran and MBDA.\n\n\u201cThis is very sensitive,\u201d Trappier said March 8 at a media conference on 2017 financial results. \u201cThis is a government-to-government contract. If there are authorizations, then it is up to the government for the component and the government for the aircraft.\u201d\n\nDassault has delivered 14 of Egypt\u2019s order for 24 Rafale aircraft.\n\nThe French Armed Forces Ministry and MBDA declined to comment.\n\nA U.S. State Department official said that \u201cas a matter of policy, we do not comment on private diplomatic exchanges, and we are restricted under federal law from commenting on issues related to specific commercial defense export licensing cases.\u201d\n\nEgypt was the first export client for the Rafale, which was part of a French arms deal that included a Naval Group multimission frigate and four Gowind corvettes, with options for two more. Egypt went on to buy two Mistral helicopter carriers, which France had bought back from Russia.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nPreviously, France ran into U.S. authorization problems on a 2013 sale of two Falcon Eye spy satellites to the United Arab Emirates. That contract lapsed, as U.S. authorization under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations for two key components was slow. France eventually closed that deal with the UAE in 2014, but only after then-French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and then-U.S. President Barack Obama met at the White House and agreed to speed up the authorization.\n\nDassault expects a down payment from Qatar \u201cshortly\u201d after exercising an option in December for 12 more Rafale fighters, Trappier said. That adds to an initial order for 24 units. Doha also asked for options for 36 more units.\n\nAsked about legal doubt over the French government-to-government offer of the Rafale to Belgium, Trappier said it was simply up to the Belgian government to exercise its national sovereignty, and decide whether to opt out of its fighter competition and pick the Rafale.\n\nThe U.S. and Britain have pitched respectively the F-35 and Eurofighter Typhoon in the Belgian tender.\n\nMalaysia is due to hold general elections soon, and Dassault expects to continue talks with the new administration on its offer of the Rafale.\n\n\u201cThe discussions will resume with the arrival of the next government,\u201d he said, addressing doubts over Malaysia\u2019s interest in the French fighter following the European Union\u2019s move to curb imports of palm oil. With Britain leaving the EU, Malaysia has signaled a change in interest to the Eurofighter, Reuters reported.\n\nDassault expects Switzerland to launch a competition soon to replace the F-5 and F-18. The firm has high hopes for the Rafale, the executive said.\n\nA previous Swiss tender picked the Saab Gripen to replace the F-5, but that selection was canceled in a public referendum.\n\nDassault expects the French government to sign a contract soon for three new Falcon jets for its Epicure airborne universal electronic warfare program, replacing an aging fleet of two Transall Gabriel aircraft. The selection likely will be the 7X or 8X versions of the Falcon twin-engine jets, Trappier said, and the deal will be will be shared with Thales."

    "text": "MELLS: BAAINBw Procures Additional Guided Missile Systems\n\n(Source: Bundeswehr; issued April 21, 2017)\n\nOn 31 March the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) signed two contracts with EuroSpike GmbH to procure an additional 1,000 guided missiles and 97 launcher units of the MELLS light multi-role guided missile system. MELLS is the German name for the variant of SPIKE missiles and launchers used by the Bundeswehr.\n\n\n\n\u201cMELLS has been used successfully by the units and we are pleased that the supplementary procurement recently ordered will allow us to take the equipment of our servicemen and -women another step forward,\u201d said Michael Engelmann, who signed the contracts on behalf of the government agency in his capacity as Director of Central Affairs at BAAINBw. Managing Directors Uwe Fahrenholz and G\u00fcnter Lauer were present to sign the contracts on behalf of EuroSpike GmbH.\n\n\n\nThe order for supplementary equipment consists of 1,000 guided missiles and 97 launcher units, including support equipment. The order volume of the two contracts amounts to approximately 137 million euros. Standards laid down in the BAAINBw Contract Management Handbook were incorporated into the contracts to minimize the contractual risks for the public purchaser.\n\n\n\nAbout 1,500 guided missiles and 16 MELLS launcher units have already been delivered to the armed forces on the basis of previous contracts. Most of the additional MELLS systems currently ordered are to be delivered to the infantry from the second half of 2018 onwards.\n\n\n\nThe company EuroSpike GmbH based in R\u00f6thenbach acts as the contractor. The system was developed by the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., which is also involved in the deal as a subcontractor, together with the companies Diehl Defence GmbH & Co. KG and Rheinmetall Defence Electronics GmbH.\n\n\n\nMELLS is a versatile weapon system. The MELLS guided missile can be used against armored ground targets such as main battle tanks at ranges of up to 4,000 meters. Apart from the Bundeswehr, the system is already in service in six other NATO countries and with the Israel Defense Forces.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

He also said the used F-18 fighter jets to be purchased from Australia will be modernized, but again he did not provide specific details.\n\nSajjan said the federal government gave direction in 2016 to the Canadian military to recruit more pilots and improve retention of aircrews and maintainers, but such a process takes time.\n\nCanada expects to accept bids in May 2019 for a new fleet of 88 fighter jets that will eventually replace the CF-18s and the used Australian aircraft. Potential aircraft in the competition include Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab\u2019s Gripen and the Boeing Super Hornet."

    "text": "Yesterday, we reported on what appeared to be the first image of Russia's much-touted, but never yet to be seen Okhotnik, or Hunter, unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) that had been in development for years and was supposed to start flight testing soon. Now, just a day later, new images have surfaced that offer up a much better look at the aircraft, as well as new insights into the drone's potential capabilities and design limitations.\n\nMake sure to read our past piece of Hunter to get up to speed, but suffice it to say that these images show an impressively large UCAV. As you can see, it dwarfs the relatively large snow plow tractor that is pulling it, leaving the impression that it is similar overall in size to a medium weight fighter, although shorter in length and significantly longer in wingspan. Its dimensions appear to be loosely analogous to Northrop Grumman's X-47B, if not larger in terms of wingspan as it doesn't appear to feature the X-47B's 'cranked kite' planform. The X-47B was roughly 38 feet long with a 62 foot wingspan.\n\nRussian Social Media\n\nFar more valuable than the forward hemisphere photos is this one from the rear. The aircraft is powered by a full-sized fighter jet engine that could potentially include afterburning capability based on the nozzle installation. This would be helpful for taking off at high gross weights, but beyond that, it would have questionable utility. The engine being used is unknown, but the Saturn AL-31F series used by the Flanker family of aircraft would be a logical choice. It is possible that a derivative of the more powerful AL-41F that is still somewhat in development could be used in the future, which may eliminate the need for an afterburner.\n\nRussian Social Media\n\nThe engine type is not as important as the configuration of the rear of the aircraft. What we see here is downright crude by western low-observable UCAV standards. The engine exhaust section appears to be sunk into a trough that features classical 'radar trap' angles. Composite structures could help with reducing such a design's radar signature from the rear aspect, but still, the design would be far from ideal. The nozzle itself is about as bad as it gets when it comes to reducing the infrared and radar signatures of the aircraft. Even if a lower-observable serrated round nozzle were added, such as one similar in concept to what is found on the F-35, this would still be a major issue when it comes to providing broadband low-observability, instead of being mainly able to elude and/or reduce the effectiveness of enemy fire control radars.\n\nRussian Social Media\n\nWhen it comes to thermal signature, there really is no difference between this aircraft and a 4th generation fighter, especially in terms of line-of-sight directly at the exhaust from the entire rear hemisphere of the aircraft. We have to also remember that this is a prototype. Maybe the final version will feature a redesign of this critical area. But we never saw that happen on Russia's 5th generation fighter, the Su-57. As it sits now, some of the biggest potential advantages of a modern UCAV, broadband low observability and highly reduced infrared signature, have been forfeited in this particular configuration. It's also worth noting that for larger stealthy flying wing aircraft, designing an exhaust to successfully reduce radar and infrared signature while also retaining efficiency and keeping the aircraft in control throughout its flight and thrust envelope is very challenging. The B-2 went through years of teething to get its planar exhausts to work without major material issues and the design is still considered sensitive technology. The X-47B never flew with its production representative exhaust. Instead, it used a less stealthy exhaust shroud during its testing career, which could have been refined on production aircraft. Still, this is nothing in comparison to the deficiencies seen on Sukhoi's exhaust design. Smaller stealthy flying wings that use lower thrust engines seem to have less of an issue in this department. Still, there is no attempt seen in Hunter's current design that even points to a low observable change down the road.\n\nDoD/Northrop Grumman X-47B during testing over Edwards AFB. Note the shroud extending from the exhaust.\n\nForward hemisphere low observability is by far the most important for traditional low-observable tactical jets. The idea is that you can kill the target before it gets a chance to look at your rear, or you can exit a vulnerable area fast enough to ensure survivability. Careful route planning supported by high-quality electronic intelligence, as well as electronic warfare support, can go a long way in overcoming this issue as well. But this really isn't the case for a UCAV. The ability of these aircraft to persist for long periods of time over enemy territory while operating in kinetic and surveillance and support roles is one of their greatest selling points. The Hunter's rear configuration will severely limit its ability in this regard. The air inlet's position in relation to the engine's fan face is also worth questioning when it comes to low observability. In the pictures, they appear as if they are fairly in line with one another, which would not be good for maintaining a stealthy signature from threat radars peering from the critical head-on aspect. We will have to wait and see if there is a serpentine duct or some sort of baffle and screen setup to help mitigate this issue. But a baffle is still not the same as serpentine duct when it comes to low-observable treatments. Considering what the rear looks like, it's possible Sukhoi just went with a baffle system. Once again, this would be similar to what happened with the Su-57's design. As we mentioned in our previous piece, the aerials and lumps on the aircraft will likely disappear after testing. But what's worth mentioning is the odd configuration of the trailing edge flight controls and flaps considering it is being pulled by a tug. Also, the APU is running on the aircraft and the engine exhaust appears to be in an under power configuration. It's possible that some sort of glitch or failure required the aircraft to be returned to a servicing area without being shut down, or it is being brought out while running for ground handling tests. The aircraft's landing gear looks similar to the one used on the Su-57, which would make sense as Hunter and the Su-57 are likely to share multiple systems and are envisioned to work alongside one another.\n\nAP Russia's Su-57 took a balanced approach to stealth while also incorporating some novel features that could help in its effectiveness and survivability. This was likely out of necessity, not choice and the Hunter UCAV adds more evidence to this conclusion. The Su-57s rear is far from ideal when it comes to low-observability, but this is less important for a tactical fighter than a deep penetrating and persisting UCAV.\n\nFinally, I want to address some questions I have been asked after our first piece regarding how Russia was able to make such an aircraft in the first place. Knowing what we now know from these pictures, I don't see how this is far outside Russia's aerospace capabilities. Nearly every major power is involved with some sort of UCAV program at this time. China has a list of them ongoing and these are just the ones we are allowed to know about. So, it's only logical that Russia, still one of the world's most prolific military aircraft manufacturers, wade into this capability area as well. Flying the aircraft and turning it into a working and effective weapon is another story entirely. Just developing the command and control software and data-link architecture will be a significant and expensive challenge for Russia. But, it is important to remember that Russia was able to examine the RQ-170 Sentinel that fell into Iranian hands. In fact, they likely led the effort to exploit every bit of technology and know-how they could from the Skunk Works-built stealthy flying wing. Do not underestimate how much of an impact this had on their ability to at least know where they needed to invest development dollars to make a similar system of their own a reality one day. With all that said, it's exciting that we are already getting multiple decent quality views of Sukhoi's long-awaited unmanned creation. For now, we will leave the analysis there, but we will update this post throughout the day with new information as it comes available, as well as key takeaways from it.

A new timetable is expected by the end of the year, which would stem the financial charges of \u20ac8.5 billion (U.S. $10.5 billion) booked by Airbus.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

The Spanish plant also works on the C-295 tactical turboprop plane and provides aircraft maintenance and repairs.\n\nThe total 3,700 job cuts will fall on 13 factories across the four partner nations, with the company expecting to assign most of the staff to other aircraft programs.\n\nA lower production rate for the A400M seeks to address the problem of the number of aircraft built but then parked on the tarmac rather than promptly delivered to client nations. That excess of inventory arose from the need to fix a problem on the propeller gearbox of the TP400 engine.\n\nSlower production also allows Airbus more time to fit equipment for tactical capabilities rather than deliver the aircraft on time and later recall them for retrofit.\n\nAirbus also expects to use that extra time to pitch the plane in export markets.\n\nA January order from Dubai-based airline Emirates for 20 A380s, with an option for 16 more, gave a lifeline for the double-decker airliners with an annual baseline delivery of six units. That Emirates order was worth $16 billion at list price, though it was likely the airline won a large discount."

The government was discussing possible reactions to the move. Significantly, the meeting came just days after a vote at the U.N. for Security Council seats, where the Maldives claimed India had supported its candidature against that of Indonesia, an election that the Maldives lost nonetheless.\n\nRelations between New Delhi and the Maldives have been frayed since last year, when Maldives rushed through a free trade agreement with China, and plummeted further after President Abdulla Yameen declared an emergency in the country in February.\n\nIndia had gifted two Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH) to Maldives in 2013, of which one was operated by the Indian Coast Guard and the other by the Indian Navy, which were manned by six pilots and a number of maintenance ground staff. In the normal course, Letters of Exchange are renewed for two years at a time, but on this occasion the Yameen government refused to do so and has since made it clear that it would like India to remove them and their crew entirely.\n\nThe LoE of the Coast Guard ALH had expired a few months ago, while the Navy ALH is due to expire in June. India has yet to recall either helicopters, in the hope that the matter will be resolved through negotiations.\n\nThe controversy had an additional twist last month when visas given to the pilots operating the helicopter expired at the end of May. A defence source said that despite requests, the visas were not renewed immediately, causing some concern for the personnel. \u201cThe MEA had to step in to sort the issue and it has now been extended by a month till June 30,\u201d the source said.\n\nMaldives has also not approved an LoE sent by India for a Dornier maritime patrol aircraft that the Maldives had itself requested, but in less tense times."

Bolivia signed a EUR185 million ($198.8 million) contract with Thales in November 2015 covering 13 radar systems to be used by the military and civil agencies.\n\n\n\nThe radar systems will begin to be installed in groups of two in January 2019. Installation is expected to be completed by December 2019.\n\n\n\nThe systems consist of seven active radar systems and six passive radar systems, also known as secondary radars. The active radars, which consist of four air defense systems, one Star 2000 primary surveillance radar, and two TRAC approach radar systems, will be operated by the military. The six RSM970 secondary radar systems will be operated by civil agencies.\n\n\n\nThe military radar systems will also have a three-dimensional detection capability. They will be able to detect distance, altitude, as well as speed.\n\n\n\nEach device will start operations gradually because, once installed, there will be a period of approximately one and a half months in which all systems are tested, then calibration flights are carried out to fine-tune the sensors. Only at the conclusion of these tests, will the radar systems be officially declared operational.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Bolivian military personnel will need to be trained in the operation of the radar systems. Operators will learn how to interpret data received by the radar systems as well as how to direct the radars to observe specific locations. Four military and four civil officials have already traveled to France to receive the training. Those eight individuals will train other operators in Bolivia.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

That agreement covers some 30 years and is an extremely close commitment, he added.\n\n\u201cIt is plain logic that that takes time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not particularly worried. We remain confident.\"\n\nNaval Group is working under a 2016 design and mobilization contract on the Australian future submarine program, while negotiating the strategic partnering agreement. The latter is a critical contract which moves the French company closer to building the diesel-electric boats in Adelaide under an Australian $50 billion (U.S. $36 billion) deal.\n\nAustralia officially announces $26B frigate contract. Here are the build details Who's building and contributing what for Australia's Future Frigate, and what technology is involved in the Type 26 design?\n\nThere is concern that failure to reach consensus on intellectual property and warranty conditions have held up a signing of the strategic partnering agreement, with time running out, Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\n\u201cNegotiations on that document have stalled and it is feared they may not be resolved before next year\u2019s federal election,\u201d ABC reported. Signing the strategic partnering agreement by the end of this year is needed to allow detailed design contracts to be finalized and building of the boats, the broadcaster reported.\n\nIn Australia, Defense Minister Christopher Pyne sought to calm the waters with an Oct. 1 reply on social media.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Neither the state-owned company nor the Slovak Defence Ministry commented on the order, citing classified character of the information.\n\nLOTN shall repair at minimum ten and at most 36 Mi-17 combat helicopters of Russian manufacturing, according to the contract. Should the whole contract be fulfilled, the order would amount to almost a ten-fold of the annual revenue of the company.\n\nCompanies from other countries were also interested in the order, according to HN \u2013 including the Czech LOM Praha firm. \u201cThis tender does not involve helicopters damaged in fights but in general repairs of Mi-17 V5 helicopters,\u201d the daily cited LOM CEO Roman Plani\u010dka. \u201cIn this tender, LTON has been selected by the supplier.\u201d\n\nThe Slovak company LOTN struggles in the long term with a lack of orders, being fully dependent on the Slovak Defence Ministry\u2019s orders. The Slovak cabinet wanted to hire the firm to a private company but the ministry last year scrapped the tender, arguing that the bidders interested in hiring the company would probably not guarantee its revival and the keeping of employment.\n\nThe value of the order could amount up to \u20ac110 million, the Sme daily wrote.\n\n3.

Gen. Galileo Gerard Kintanar, commanding general of the air force, earlier confirmed that the technical working group prefers the T129 and has passed the recommendation to procure the helicopters before the Department of National Defense (DND), the report read.\n\nThe DND would then engage with TAI for the possible government-to-government deal between the two countries.\n\n\"While specifics remain unclear, that would no doubt represent a landmark deal for the defense relationship between the two countries, where defense equipment transfers and sales have been discussed but have yet to manifest themselves in concrete, significant deals,\" Prashanth Parameswaran wrote on his article in The Diplomat.\n\nThe Diplomat stressed that both the Philippines and Turkey would have to take a number of steps to finalize the agreement as Philippine officials have no final decision yet.\n\nIf the deal pushes through, \"the acquisition is expected to be facilitated through a government-to-government deal between the Philippines and Turkey, possibly involving credit provided by Turk Eximbank, Turkey's official export credit agency,\" Jane's also reported.\n\nIn February, the DND terminated a contract for the procurement of 16 helicpters from Canadian Commercial Corp after Ottawa raised concern that the choppers might be used in human rights violations.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte ordered the scrapping of the contract due to supposed conditions being imposed for the agreement.\n\nWhat prompted Duterte to cancel the deal were the remarks of Canada's top diplomat to conduct \"extremely rigorous\" human rights analysis of any potential export of military equipment to the Philippines. \u2014 Patricia Lourdes Viray"

    "text": "Angola Wants German Investors and War Ships\n\n(Source: Deutsche Welle German Radio; issued Aug 23, 2018)\n\nAngola's President Joao Lourenco is in Europe to promote the country as investment-friendly. In Germany, he is not only seeking ordinary investment in agriculture, technology or construction. Lourenco wants war ships.\n\n\n\nLourenco was on a two-day official visit to Berlin, 11 months after he was picked to succeed Angola's president for 38 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos.\n\n\n\n\"We're inviting German investors to work with the Angolan state to protect our coastline - either for the supply of war vessels, for our navy, or of other electronical means in order to control our vast maritime frontier, which is a part of the Gulf of Guinea used by pirates and terrorists,\" Lourenco said.\n\n\n\nThe visit is not Lourenco's first to Berlin and Angola's interest in acquiring German-built naval vessels is not new. In 2014, as defence minister, he signed a cooperation deal in Berlin and said Angola needed more war ships.\n\n\n\nThree years before that, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had suggested the sale of such vessels to Angola during a visit to Luanda. That offer was so sharply criticized by the German opposition that it never materialized.\n\n\n\nMerkel open for talks\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, after meeting with Lourenco, Merkel said she remembered the old controversy but was still open to discussing defense matters with the southern African country.\n\n\n\n\"It might be that certain investments on the Angolan side materialize and then, naturally, we would gladly partner when it comes to such investment decisions by the Angolan navy,\" Merkel said.\n\n\n\nAngola is Africa's second largest oil exporter after Nigeria. These exports are its main source of revenue. Faced with falling commodity prices and a $21.5 billion (\u20ac18.5 billion) debt to China, Angola is now trying to diversify. Germany has promised to help.\n\n\n\nAngola was caught in a post-independence civil war from 1975 to 2002\n\n\n\nAngolan journalist Emanuel Matondo, who is based in Germany, is a fierce critic of Luanda's defense spending. \"Angola spends too much money buying arms,\" Matondo told DW.\n\n\n\nAngola's defense spending accounts for 21 percent of its entire budget for this year. It will spend 11.3 percent on education and 7.4 percent on the health.\n\n\n\nMatondo would rather see the oil-rich country's money go towards comprehensive social and economic reforms, in order to alleviate the plight of millions of Angolans who live in poverty.\n\n\n\n\"Angola is experiencing an economic crisis. Why? Because money was stolen. So, first of all, the president should \u2013 with those reforms \u2013 create the conditions for investors to finance projects in Angola,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAfrica's richest woman: Isabel dos Santos, daughter of Angola's former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos and former head of state oil company Sonangol, is being investigated for corruption.\n\n\n\nLourenco stirs things up\n\n\n\nAside from courting foreign investors, Lourenco he's been stirring things up since he assumed office. He has sacked top state officials with ties to dos Santos and vowed to fight corruption.\n\n\n\nBefore arriving in Berlin, Lourenco addressed the European Parliament \u2013 in Strasbourg, France and visited Brussels. The message he brought for Europeans was that it is worthwhile investing in Angola, and much easier now to register a company there.\n\n\n\n\"The government is making important reforms in the judicial and criminal investigation sectors in order to fight corruption and impunity in a more effective way, and ensuring business transparency,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCurrently only around 30 German companies have a representation in Angola. In 2017, bilateral trade turnover was under \u20ac299 million, provisional official statistics in Germany show.\n\n\n\nAngola imports mainly cars, machines and technology. Germany buys Angolan oil and gas. Merkel has said there is much room for improving economic ties.\n\n\n\nBusiness isn't easy\n\n\n\nGerman companies are still struggling with a lack of foreign currency, due to lower oil profits. In general, the investment climate remains unfriendly. Angola ranks 175th out of 190 countries on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index.\n\n\n\n\"We need to ensure the financing of large projects. Certainly, corruption is still an issue. But the Angolan president also mentioned, that there's the need to fight strongly against corruption,\" said Heinz-Walter Grosse, who heads the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of German Business.\n\n\n\nPolitical anthropologist Jon Schubert said that despite Lourenco's reforms, there's still a long way to go in Angola's \"crusade\" against corruption, and to achieve the investment-friendly environment the president is promising.\n\n\n\n\"It's extremely difficult to change, in a year, bad habits that have taken root for decades,\" said Schubert.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "ABU DHABI \u2014 Moscow and New Delhi have agreed to perform design work in India on what Russia claims would be a \"fifth generation\" version of the Su-35, an agreement that may lead to an Indian variant of the fighter jet, the Russian Military Complex chief said.\n\nThe announcement makes India the first country to sign a contract, however preliminary, for the S version of the Su-35 .\n\n\"We have been negotiating and have signed the intention protocol for the Su-35,\" Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said during the IDEX show in Abu Dhabi last month. \"Now we are working on designing ideas for this contract and on creating a manufacturing platform for the aircraft of the fifth generation.\"\n\nRostec is Russia's state-run corporation that oversees export of high-tech products.\n\nChemezov said the jet would be developed to meet the Indian Air Force's requirements . He did not say how many of the jets India might plan to buy.\n\nRussia claims the Su-35S would be a fifth generation fighter, as opposed to the legacy fourth generation Su-35. That implies stealth, but it's unclear whether the jet would be on par with an F-35 joint strike fighter.\n\nIn India, however, no source in the Defence Ministry could confirm that any deal had been signed with Russia on the Su-35S. An Air Force official did say that the Russians have made one or two Su-35S presentations in the past six months on how it can help replace India's MiG-21 and MiG-27 fighter aircraft, which are due for retirement in seven or eight years.\n\nRussian industry sources said the fighter will be priced at $85 million. That could make it competitive with Dassault Aviation's Rafale, and could have implications for India's proposed purchase of 126 Rafales. New Delhi selected the Rafale as the preferred bidder in a protracted competition in 2012, but has yet to make a final decision on the purchase.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIndian and French defense ministers discussed the Rafale deal during Jean-Yves Le Drian's recent visit to India, an Indian MoD source said. But Indian Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar did not provide a time commitment to Le Drian on when the deal will be signed.\n\nParrikar told Le Drian that state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) has been asked to complete cost estimates for the Rafales it will build under license.\n\nThe French defense minister's spokesman was not available for comment.\n\nA Dassault Aviation spokesman, asked about the Indian agreement for design work on the Su-35S, said the Indian Air Force chief has said a Sukhoi cannot replace a Rafale.\n\nIn India, the Economic Times, reported on Feb. 19 that Indian Air Force chief Arup Raha ruled out a purchase of additional Su-30s as the Russian fighter and the Rafale complemented each other rather than the former replacing the latter.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Paris in April, which could be an opportunity for some clarification on the potential Rafale deal, Agence-France Presse has reported.\n\nRussian aircraft makers have been eagerly proclaiming their willingness to step in if India ultimately rejects the French jet. Many believe Russia wants to undercut France as punishment for Paris refusing to deliver two Mistral helicopters carriers to Russia amid deepening tensions with Ukraine.\n\n\"If [India] needs additional Su-30MKI fighters, then we are ready to work out such an agreement,\" Sergei Goreslavsky, deputy director of Russia's arms export agency Rosoboronexport, told the RIA Novosti news agency on Feb. 16. India operates a large fleet of Sukhoi Su-30 fighters, some of which have been locally produced by HAL.\n\nAnd Russia's RSK MiG says it would offer an upgraded version of its developmental MiG-35 if India reopens the tender.\n\n\"We have every chance to compete [for the contract],\" MiG chief Sergei Korotkov said at Aero India on Feb. 18, according to the RIA Novosti new agency. \"We have not lost hope that a future tender or competition will be announced.\"\n\nIndia remains dependent on Russia to supply weaponry and the two countries have been successful in conducting joint development programs involving advanced technologies, including the co-production of the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile.\n\n\"Efforts will be made to modernize the Indian defense forces with emphasis on Make-in-India defense programs,\" an Indian MoD official said. \"India remains committed to buy advanced technologies.\"\n\nIndia's dependence on Russia for the bulk of its weapons systems, said defense analyst Nitin Mehta.\n\n\"India wants to buy advanced systems like the Rafale, even at a higher cost,\" he said. \"[But] dependence on Russians will remain ... and it would be difficult to find the resources to replace these with advanced systems immediately.\"\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Su-35S would enter Russian service this year as part of the expansion of the Air Force and Naval Aviation branch.\n\n\"Currently, we're testing a new Su-35S multifunctional fighter jet. This year, the new aircraft should enter service. This is the main task for this year,\" Shoigu said in February.\n\nChina is also considering a purchase of Su-35s. A February report by Zvezda, a television network run by the Russian military, said that long-running talks might conclude with a deal to buy 24 fighters on May 19.\n\nChemezov said that the contract, if signed, would provide China with the fourth-generation Su-35, not India's fifth-generation S model.\n\n\"This aircraft is called Su-35-4 plus PAK-FA generation and we are negotiating with China and we are in progress and I hope it will be over soon. I wouldn't like to discuss contracts that have still not been signed,\" he said. \"The important point is that this is a very unique aircraft that has not been delivered to any country.\"\n\nAnother potential customer for the Su-35 is Egypt. Last fall, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed an arms deal reportedly worth $3.5 billion. Egyptian media reported that the package included Su-35s.\n\nBut Chemezov said no firm purchase deal had been settled.\n\n\"We have not signed anything with Egypt; we signed an intention protocol and we are negotiating it. I hope soon we will sign a contract,\" he said.\n\nExperts have suggested that Egypt, long a customer of US arms makers, would have trouble integrating Russian hardware.\n\n\"This would require a significant investment and both sides have been in negotiations for years without results,\" said Ruslan Aliev, of Moscow's Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.\n\nBut Chemezov said the two countries have already agreed on training protocols in case the purchase goes through.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, the terms and conditions of the contract that have been signed maintain not only the delivery and other terms but also the training,\" he said. \"First the pilot will be trained in Russia and later in Egypt, as an example when we supplied the helicopters to the Pentagon, which were then delivered to Afghanistan the pilots took their training to Russia.\""

    "text": "The U.S. State Department recently approved the potential sale to Finland of more than $800 million worth of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles, Mk 41 vertical launch systems, and other associated items. Depending on how that country decides to proceed with its Squadron 2020 naval modernization program, some of those systems could go into a new class of ice-breaking multi-purpose corvettes, as well as end up on older ships as part of various planned upgrade projects. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. military\u2019s main foreign military sales office, announced the possible arms packages in three separate notices in February 2018. The announcements say that the 100 RGM-84Q-4 Harpoon Block II+ Extended Range missiles, plus another dozen older RGM-84L-4s that Finland would upgrade to that standard itself using conversion kits, would arm its existing Hamina-class missile boats and shore-based coastal defense batteries. The 68 RIM-162s, also known as ESSMs, and the four Mk 41s would be part of the armament package on the four all-new corvettes the country is building under the Squadron 2020 plan.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that U.S. government approval does not mean a country has agreed to purchase the weapons or other systems in question. Finland is in the middle of a competition to select a new anti-ship missile to replace its existing Swedish-made RBS-15 Mk IIs and Boeing\u2019s Harpoon is just one potential option. The other contenders are the RBS-15 Mk III+ from Sweden\u2019s Saab Bofors Dynamics, the Naval Strike Missile (NSM) from Norway\u2019s Kongsberg, and latest iteration of the European missile consortium MBDA\u2019s Exocet MM40. The same is true, perhaps even more so, with regards to Finland\u2019s future multi-purpose corvettes. The Finnish Ministry of Defense is pursuing a two-track plan to develop and purchase those ships, having hired the country\u2019s own Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) to craft the basic hullform in April 2017.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia The Finnish Hamina-class missile boat Tornio, which could receive Harpoon anti-ship missiles as part of a ongoing upgrade program.\n\nIn 2018, Finland expects to award a separate contract for the systems that will go into those ships. Germany\u2019s Atlas Elektronik, the Canadian subsidiary of American firm Lockheed Martin, and Swedish defense contractor Saab are bidding on that deal. Atlas Elektronik and Saab both already supply systems for various Finnish Navy ships. How RMC defines the basic ship design and its capabilities is likely to have impact on whether or not the new corvettes will feature the Mk 41s, which can hold four ESSMs quad-packed in each launch cell. The Sylver vertical launch system from France's DCNS is another option, but would require Finland to also choose MDBA's Aster surface-to-air missile as the ship's primary air defense weapon. And though the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s plan does call for the new corvettes to have a robust local air defense capability, it won\u2019t necessary be the main focus for the engineers at RMC. \u201cIn the initial phase it was recognized that this type of new vessel with the required capabilities did not exist,\u201d according to an official primer on the Squadron 2020 project. \u201cThe vessels on the market were not capable of mine-laying and navigating in ice,\u201d it continues. \u201cFor a warship, the requirements arising from mine-laying and winter navigation are rare in the international context but they are essential for the Finnish Navy to fulfil its tasks.\u201d\n\nFinnish Ministry of Defense A rudimentary breakdown of the systems the Finnish Ministry of Defense wants on the new Squadron 2020 corvettes.\n\nFinland\u2019s shoreline is entirely along the Baltic Sea, much of which is frozen over or otherwise full of potentially dangerous ice floes during the winter. Some of the Finnish Navy\u2019s ships, such as its two aging H\u00e4meenmaa-class minelayers, do have a limited ice-breaking capability, but its smaller missile boats, such as the Hamina-class, have much more difficulty operating under those conditions. \u201cThe endurance and sea-going capabilities significantly limit the performance of the Hamina-class \u2026 in ice conditions and during rough sea,\u201d the Finnish Ministry of Defense\u2019s guide to the Squadron 2020 program notes. On top of the ice, \u201cgale-force winds and the resulting wave heights restrict the operation of light naval units on the open sea. The significant wave height may reach six meters and more annually in the northern part of the Baltic Sea.\u201d The Baltic is already an extremely confined space without those environmental hazards and an all-weather ice-capable warship would be invaluable for the Finnish Navy. Finland isn\u2019t alone in recognizing the importance of having combat vessels that can operate in extreme cold weather conditions, either. Russia, Finland\u2019s most likely potential opponent in the region, is also developing ice-breaking anti-ship missile armed corvettes, though it will most likely deploy to support the country\u2019s expanding military operations the Arctic.\n\nPella Shipyard Russia An artist's rendering of Russia's future Project 23550 Ice-class missile armed, ice-capable corvette.\n\nIt\u2019s the constraints of the Baltic that also make maritime mine warfare particularly attractive in both offensive and defensive scenarios. This is again especially true with regards to Russia, which has significant naval assets based in St. Petersburg and elsewhere. Already historical antagonists, relations between the two countries have been steadily worsening in recent years, with Finland increasing its cooperation with the United States and other members of the NATO alliance and Russian officials threatening to retaliate economically and militarily in response. Finnish authorities already accuse Russian military aircraft of routinely and provocatively violating their airspace. In a naval engagement, Russian ships and submarines would have to transit through the Gulf of Finland \u2013 less than 100 miles across at its widest point \u2013 to get into the Baltic Sea proper and Finnish mines could easily constrain their movements. It could also limit the ability of naval reinforcements from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad enclave to the south or elsewhere to rush into the area in a crisis. As such, minelaying is an extremely important capability for the Finns, who have various dedicated minelayers already in service. In addition, depth charge racks on its small missile boats, they can also deploy mines. The primary type in Finnish service is Patria\u2019s Sea Mine 2000, which reportedly has features that make it hard to detect and multiple sensors \u2013 possibly including acoustic, magnetic, and other types \u2013 to both detect potential targets and discriminate between them to focus on the most valuable ships in a task force.\n\nMKFI via Wikimedia Patria's Sea Mine 2000."

The sale was announced last year and the aircraft was recently seen flying in Russia.\n\nThe helicopter was spotted in Malian colours at Rostvertol\u2019s facility at Rostov-on-Don in March, painted in desert camouflage with a Mali air force roundel on the bottom.\n\nNews of Mali\u2019s acquisition surfaced in September last year when Yury Demchenko, Rosoboronexport delegation head for the Africa Aerospace and Defence (AAD) exhibition in South Africa said over the next year Russian Helicopters would deliver Mi-8/17 transport and Mi-24/35 attack helicopters to Nigeria, Mali, Angola and Sudan.\n\nHe did not, however, give the number of aircraft ordered by Mali nor the delivery dates. Mali already operates a number of older Mi-24s.\n\nThe upgraded Mi-35M features several improvements over its predecessors, such as new avionics with multifunction colour displays, more powerful Klimov VK-2500 turboshaft engines developing 2 200 hp, fibreglass main rotor blades, main rotor head with elastomeric joints, a new swashplate and X-type tail rotor. The Mi-35M\u2019s fuselage has shortened stub wings and fixed landing gear. The helicopter\u2019s sighting system has a thermal imager, TV camera and laser rangefinder and designator.\n\nAccording to Russian Helicopters, weapons include Ataka-V or Shturm-V ant-tank missiles and Igla-V air-to-air missiles, 80 or 122 mm rockets and a GSh-231 23-mm twin-barrel cannon. In addition to weapons, the Mi-35M can carry up to eight personnel in its cabin or cargo weighing 1 500 kg while up to 2 400 kg can be carried on an external sling.\n\nThe self-protection suite includes a radar warning receiver, chaff & flare dispenser, infrared jammer and engine exhaust suppressor.\n\nNigeria, meanwhile, has already started receiving its twelve Mi-35Ms, which were ordered in October 2015. The first was delivered in December 2016, according to NAF Chief of Air Staff Sadique Abubakar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRosoboronexport hopes for more business from Africa due to peacekeeping missions, terrorism, piracy, smuggling and trafficking."

The press service of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry reports this.\n\n\u201cIt should be taken into account, that the delivery date of the engines and power constructions was determined by SIPRI experts after the certain types of military equipment and armaments had been produced by Russia. The same is with aircraft and ships, which were transferred to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation then, but not the delivery of individual components in present days. That is why the engines or the power constructions had been delivered till 2014, however, SIPRI publication states it has happened recently\u201d, - Ukrobonprom said.\n\nThey explain that during 2014-2018, Ukraine had been supplying the AI-222 turbojet engines to Russia, which are installed on the Russian Yak-130 combat training aircraft. However, the private enterprise Motor-Sich produces such engines in Zaporizhia, this enterprise is not a part of the state-owned concern. In addition, the supply contracts were signed in 2016, and the actual delivery took place in 2009-2014.\n\nAccording to the report, An-140-100 and An-148-100E aircrafts had been previously exported to the Russian Federation, however, the delivery stopped in 2014. The aircrafts started to manufacture in Russia with a license issued by the state enterprise Antonov.\n\nBesides, Ukraine supplied shipborne gas turbine constructions DS-71 to Russia, produced by the NPK Zorya-Mashproyekt in Mykolaiv (they were equipped with three Russian frigates of the project 11356). The Ukroboronprom claims that they had been delivered before the ban on the export of weapons to the Russian Federation came into force."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nLast month, the Russian military took delivery of a new S-400 Triumf advanced Air Defense System (NATO reporting name: SA-21 Growler) regiment, according to local media reports. It is the second S-400 regiment to be inducted into the ranks of the Russian Army in 2016 and will further boost Russia\u2019s so called anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capability. (S-400 units have so far been deployed to Kaliningrad along the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea region, Syria covering the eastern Mediterranean Sea, as well as in Russia\u2019s Far East.)\n\nThree additional S-400 regiments are slated for delivery by the end of 2016, according to an official in the Russian defense industry, which will bring up the total number of S-400 regiments to 16. One S-400 regiment is divided into two battalions. Each battalion consists of eight launchers and 32 missiles in addition to acquisition and engagement radar systems and a command post.\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, the S-300, the S-400 air defense system features an improved radar system and updated software; it can purportedly can fire four new types of surface-to-air (SAM) missiles in addition to the S-300\u2019s 48N6E, a vertical tube launched, solid fuel, single stage SAM with an estimated range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and the improved 48N6E2 missile with a reported range of 195 kilometers (121 miles).\n\nOne of the S-400\u2019s new missiles is the so-called 40N6 SAM with an estimated operational range of 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) and an altitude of up to 185 kilometers (607,000 feet). The missile is reportedly capable of exo-atmospheric interception of intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads in their terminal phase. However, it is unclear whether the weapon is operational in Russia yet and no images of the 40N6 SAM have surfaced so far.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe S-400 is also armed with an improved variant of the 48N6E2 with an alleged range of 250 kilometers (160 miles). The air defense system can also fire two additional missiles, the 9M96E and 9M96E2 with respective ranges of 40 km (25 miles) and 120 km (75 miles). Improved S-300 air defense systems such as the S-300PMU-2 Favorite (sold to Iran), can purportedly also fire the 9M96E and 9M96E2.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access.

It can engage stand-off jammer aircraft, Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, and both ballistic and cruise missiles in an electronic countermeasures environment. Russia is also working on a newer long-range air defense system, the S-500 Prometheus, which will specifically be designed to intercept up to ten ballistic missiles simultaneously."

    "text": "BEIRUT \u2014 Four years after Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi took charge of managing the country\u2019s affairs, dozens of military-owned companies have flourished and the Army has undergone a rapid military buildup, a reflection of Egypt\u2019s efforts to return to prestige.\n\nTo strengthen this progress, el-Sissi stressed in July the importance of continuing the development of companies and factories affiliated with the Ministry of Military Production, as well as enhancing the national industry, exporting surplus production and developing military products to cover the needs of the Armed Forces. He also underlined the need to boost cooperation between the ministry and major global companies to acquire modern technology and bolster local innovation.\n\nAssuming the president\u2019s plans are a success, Egypt could expand its defense-industrial base beyond domestic requirements, and toward global competition.\n\nMilitary-technical cooperation between Egypt and other countries \u2014 mainly Russia, China and the United States (the two former of which have an interest in dislodging the latter\u2019s influence in the Middle East) \u2014 has reached \u201can unprecedented level during the last two years,\u201d according to Mohamed al-Kenany, a researcher at the Arab Forum for Iranian Policy Analysis.\n\n\u201cThis period has witnessed a number of frequent visits and meetings between the minister of military production, Mohamed el Assar, and a number of defense ministers, ambassadors and heads of international defense companies,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those strong relationships have translated into global cooperation, explained Ahmed Kamel al-Beheiri, an expert in regional security issues at the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies.\n\nA jet sale to Egypt is being blocked by a US regulation, and France is over it France is seeking to reduce its reliance on U.S. approval for French arms exports as Washington withholds clearance for an American component on the French Scalp cruise missile.\n\n\u201cThis [is reflected] by the transfer of experience with the Russians in the air defense systems field, Germany in the maritime manufacturing and light weapons domain, and China through unmanned aerial vehicles and its complementary technology,\u201d he said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nIn terms of potential domestic production, al-Beheiri noted that Egypt is currently working a strategy to increase capabilities \u201cthrough a joint cooperation with international companies for the transfer and localization of both hard and soft technologies within the military forces arsenal \u2013 especially one that concerns the air defense missile field.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, manufacturing light and medium weapons is considered a vital realm to the Egyptians nowadays,\u201d he added.\n\nIn terms of exporting some potential weapons, al-Beheiri sees potential in the near future, especially as \u201cEgypt has already begun exporting some types of weapons to both African and Arab countries, such as Iraq.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the big nations with which Egypt is looking to partner. Al-Kenany noted that South Africa\u2019s Paramount Group has been in talks with the Egyptian government for several months, with an eye on expanding \u201cEgypt\u2019s military manufacturing capabilities and strengthen its status as an arms export source for several African countries.\u201d\n\nThat could include establishing a modern defense complex to produce various military equipment, including armored vehicles.\n\nBut China and Russia loom large, particularly as the politics of the last several years have driven a wedge between Cairo and Washington.\n\nAccording to one industrial source who spoke to Defense News on condition of anonymity, American industry is losing its grip on weapon sales to Egypt.\n\n\u201cWashington recognizes that Egypt is a strategically important partner and a large [customer in the] U.S arms market. So we can suppose that there is a clear American fear of the Egyptian side falling into the arms of the Russians or Chinese,\u201d the source said. \u201cMoscow has been able to consolidate its position as a major force in Syria and succeeded in attracting Turkey to its side; therefore, Washington will not allow Cairo to withdraw towards Moscow or repeat the Turkish experience by stepping out of the American abyss.\u201d\n\nBut al-Kenany is convinced that the U.S.-Egypt industrial relationship is \u201chealthy.\u201d"

    "text": "Author: Dushni Weerakoon, Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka\n\nWhen it comes to Sri Lanka\u2019s national security and sovereignty, nothing seems more guaranteed to generate heated discussion than the spectre of foreign involvement in seaport developments. After years of wrangling, Sri Lanka, India and Japan finally signed a Memorandum of Cooperation on 28 May 2019 to develop the strategically-located Colombo port\u2019s East Container Terminal (ECT). But the ink was barely dry when disputes broke out again about the government\u2019s authority to divest \u2018strategic assets\u2019 to foreign companies.\n\nThe ECT deal is yet another of Sri Lanka\u2019s entanglements in regional and global power rivalries, which are being played out on its shores. Ownership over maritime port connectivity appears to have become symbolic of this power play.\n\nA tripartite agreement on the ECT is expected to be concluded within three months. Japan has stepped forward with the offer of a soft loan for the first phase of the project. Other institutional arrangements appear to include the setting up of a Terminal Operations Company (TOC) in which Sri Lanka will hold a 51 per cent majority equity stake, while India and Japan will together hold the other 49 per cent. In a somewhat confusing clarification, Sri Lanka is still said to have 100 per cent ownership over the ECT itself.\n\nBut it was China that had a head start in investing in Sri Lanka\u2019s infrastructure push. Under successive governments, two critical projects have come to guarantee China\u2019s long-term presence in the country\u2019s port infrastructure. The first is a joint venture to develop and manage the Colombo International Container Terminal, while the second is the construction of the Hambantota port on a loan taken out by Sri Lanka.\n\nChina Merchant Port Holdings holds an 85 per cent equity stake in the Colombo International Container Terminal, which became operational in 2013 as a 35-year build\u2013operate\u2013transfer project. The Hambantota port, which started operations in 2011, saw a 70 per cent equity transfer to China Merchant Port Holdings in 2017 on a 99-year lease (in what has been widely, and erroneously, cited as a poster case of Chinese \u2018debt-trap diplomacy\u2019 to force asset transfers).\n\nWhat is not disputed is that the two projects have had widely differing performance outcomes. The Colombo International Container Terminal \u2014 accounting for 38 per cent of container handling at Colombo port in 2018 \u2014 has been a prime driver of improvements in the port\u2019s overall performance. Colombo port, overall, was ranked 13th in the Drewry Port Connectivity Index in 2017, and was placed first by Alphaline Global Ports\u2019 2018 rankings of container handling. In contrast, Hambantota port has failed to deliver. The Sri Lankan authorities opted to hand over the port to China Merchant Port Holdings, rather than channel additional investment to make the port financially viable.\n\nAside from port investments, China\u2019s long-term footprint in Sri Lanka has also been assured through a direct investment of US$1.4 billion in the Colombo Port City project. The project is an ambitious reclamation of land, adjacent to the Colombo port itself, for development on yet another 99-year lease. The reclaimed land will be ready in July 2019 to attract its first set of investors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, China\u2019s geopolitical rivals are intent on catching up and making their own claims to \u2018strategic assets\u2019, whether in seaports or even airports. India has expressed interest in the China-built and unprofitable Mattala International Airport, which is found in close proximity to the Hambantota port.\n\nMultiple countries, including China, had expressed interest in developing the ECT at Colombo port. Efforts to balance regional concerns with China\u2019s already firm presence in Sri Lanka\u2019s maritime connectivity infrastructure \u2014 not to mention political manoeuvers \u2014 saw negotiations drag on from 2016. Unsurprisingly, the Memorandum on the ECT is being interpreted in some quarters as providing an alternative to China\u2019s Belt and Road ambitions in the region.\n\nFor financially constrained economies like Sri Lanka, soft loans from foreign governments to build vital infrastructure appear very attractive. The Colombo International Container Terminal is estimated to already be operating at 80 per cent capacity. While Colombo\u2019s port performance bypasses its South Asian neighbours, it faces increased competition from rapid port developments in India and pressure from India\u2019s relaxation of cabotage rules in 2018. With Indian shippers accounting for about 80 per cent of throughput at Colombo port, India\u2019s commercial interest in developing the ECT can benefit Sri Lanka as well.\n\nClearly though, investing in maritime infrastructure connectivity comes at a price for a country like Sri Lanka. The risks from being caught up in a spiralling geopolitical contest are mounting. Understanding the long-term strategic implications of being bound up with a multiplicity of powerful rivals in maritime connectivity is increasingly important.\n\nDr Dushni Weerakoon is the Executive Director and Head of Macroeconomic Policy Research at the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka (IPS)."

Indeed Austal has delivered or has orders for a total of 97 patrol boats for Australia and around the world.\n\nOver the past six weeks, we have had the Ted Diro crew from the PNG Navy at Austal training on how to use and maintain the new vessels. Their positive feedback on the greater capability, amenity and operability of the Guardian Class has been fantastic. We look forward to show casing the new vessels to the other Pacific Island nations over the life of the 21vessel program through to 2023\u201d. Austal CEO, David Singleton said.\n\n\u201cThis is Austal\u2019s first major ship building program in steel. It is a reflection of the skills, experience and management of the Austal team that, since May 2016 they have developed a brand new production facility at Naval Base in Western Australia, designed a production line process, completed the detailed vessel design and are now delivering the first vessel 30 months later.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe program is now in a full rate of production, with the second vessel, which is destined for Tuvalu, successfully launched on Monday with an additional three vessels in various stages of construction. Austal are already looking at export opportunities for the GCPB\u201d Mr Singleton said.\n\nThe Pacific Patrol Boat contract was awarded to Austal in May 2016 with a contract option in April 2018 taking the program to 21 vessels valued at AU$335 million. The program supports more than 200 direct jobs at Austal and more than a further 200 indirect jobs through the Australian industry involved in the program. Austal has around 1000 employees in Australia directly contributing to delivering a strong domestic and export shipbuilding industry."

    "text": "Figure 1: Launch of a Yemeni Burkan 2-H missile on December 19th 2017.\n\nDEN HELDER, Netherlands: The Saudi and US governments have accused Iran of manufacturing ballistic missile used in attacks by Houthis against targets in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe longest-ranged flights reached Riyadh, a distance of roughly 950 km, with a missile called the Burkan 2-H (Figure 1 above).\n\nIn terms of the physical damage they can cause, these missiles with their 500 kg payload make for a relatively poor weapon. However, their speed makes them difficult to intercept (the flight time is only about nine minutes). The fact the launches are continuing a few years after the start of the conflict, shows that the Saudi-led coalition has not succeeded in interdicting Houthi missiles or destroying them on the ground. Consequently, Saudi civilians as far away from the conflict as Riyadh are not completely safe from Houthi attacks. In a broader context, it is a disturbing development that this sort of weapon is in the hands of a rebel movement fighting a war in the Middle East and aligned with Iran. The Scud is not dead yet.\n\nBut are the Iranians really behind these, or are they modified missiles from North Korean in origin? Visually, the similarities between the Burkan 2-H and the Iranian Qiam-1, which is a development of the Soviet Scud missile, are hard to deny. The missiles have the same configuration with a so-called triconic warhead and without the large stabilizing fins common to other Scud versions. In a briefing on December 14 last year, standing in a DC warehouse in front of debris of a missile recovered in Saudi Arabia, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, pointed at other similarities such as the location of valves and vents in the tanks. Furthermore, the logo of an Iranian manufacturer was visible on some of the debris.\n\nThe most common version of the Scud, known as the SS-1C Scud-B, had a much shorter range of roughly 300 km with a 990 kg payload. It first flew roughly 70 years ago. It seems surprising that a variant of such an old missile would have the range to reach Riyadh. There has also been speculation that the missiles used against Riyadh are indigenous Yemeni developments of missiles delivered from North Korea.\n\nIn this article I take a closer look at the Burkan 2-H and how its increased performance was achieved. I do this using computer simulations of ballistic missile trajectories, with missile parameters based on properties of the Scud from open sources and an analysis of photographs and a launch video. The simulations confirm the similarities with the Iranian missile: a Scud-variant with the size and initial acceleration of the Burkan 2-H can only fly from Northwest Yemen to Riyadh if it carries as much propellant as the Qiam-1. Other versions of the Scud do not fit the data.\n\nScud missiles were widely exported and formed the starting point for the ballistic missile programs of North Korea and Iran. North-Korean variants include the Hwasong-5, similar to the Scud-B, and the Hwasong-6/Scud-C. The range of the latter has been increased to 500 km, thanks to more propellant, a lighter airframe with a shared bulkhead between the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and a payload reduced to roughly 750 kg. North Korea has built other longer-range Scud versions. A drawing of a missile usually referred to as the Scud-D was uncovered in 1999, when Indian Customs officials inspected the North Korean freighter Kowulsan, believed to be heading for Libya. The drawing shows a longer and heavier missile. In September of 2016, the DPRK launched several Scud-like missiles towards the Sea of Japan. These missiles, known as the Scud-ER, appeared to have a larger diameter than other versions and covered a distance of roughly 1,000 km. Variants of the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6 are in service in Iran, where they are known as the Shahab-1 and Shahab-2, respectively. The Qiam-1 is a more advanced version first unveiled in Iran in 2010.\n\nBefore the current civil war, Yemen also received Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6 missiles from North Korea. Fifteen of these were uncovered in 2002 aboard another North-Korean freighter, the So San. This was intercepted in the Gulf of Aden by the Spanish Navy, but ultimately allowed to continue its journey because there was insufficient legal ground to detain it. Some of the ballistic missiles used by the Houthis likely are of North-Korean origin, but the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6 lack the range to reach Riyadh. In 2016 the Yemeni Houthi Ministry of Defense unveiled the Burkan-1, described as being 12.5 m long, with a mass of 8 tons and a range of 800 km with a 500 kg payload. These numbers match the rumored Scud-D.\n\nThe first confirmed attack against Riyadh took place on November fourth last year, when a missile was launched against King Khalid Airport, north of the Saudi capital. On December 19th there was another attack against the city with the missile shown in Figure 1. The next attack, involving multiple missiles, occurred on March 25.\n\nSaudi Arabia has claimed successful intercepts of the incoming missiles using Patriot surface-to-air missiles. Video footage of the March engagement on social media, however, shows one interceptor exploding shortly after launch and another spectacularly veering of course before impacting the ground. Falling debris from the interceptors or the Yemeni missiles, caused at least one fatality. Further missile attacks followed on April 11 and on May 9.\n\nFigure 2 shows a comparison between a Shahab-1, Shahab-2 and the Qiam-1 and Yemeni Burkan 2-H, with estimated tank sizes and lengths. The lengths were found by scaling with the 0.88 m diameter typical for most Scud variants.\n\nExternally the versions can be distinguished by comparing the lengths of the cable raceways that guide wiring past the propellant tanks. The wiring connects the guidance equipment, located near the top of the booster, to actuators for thrust-vectoring vanes in the exhaust nozzle used for steering. The lengths indicate that the Qiam-1 uses a different airframe than the Hwasong-6/ Shahab-2, with longer tanks. The dimensions of the Qiam-1 and Burkan 2-H are practically identical, within the error margins of the measurements, and in the simulations they are treated as the same.\n\nFinding the Missiles\u2019 Parameters\n\nThe Houthi group Ansar Allah released video of the December 2017 launch. By measuring the missile position in the image as a function of time and scaling this with the missile length, we can measure the initial acceleration of the missile.\n\nFigure 3: Acceleration measurement of the Burkan 2-H launch based on a launch video, with one per five frames shown. (Original video: Ansar Allah.)\n\nEvents in the video match the accompanying sound, which makes it unlikely that the video framerate has been manipulated. The measured acceleration is 12.2 m/s2 with an uncertainty of roughly 5 percent. This gives a take-off thrust-to-weight ratio of 2.25. The mass flow rate, propellant specific impulse, burn time and thrust for the basic Scud-B are known. The total weight of the Qiam-1/ Burkan 2-H can now be matched to the thrust of the Scud engine and the measured thrust-to-weight ratio. The volume of the propellant tanks can be found using the locations of visible welds in the body and the length of the cable raceways.\n\nThere is some uncertainty in the exact shape of the tanks, in how much of the tanks is filled with propellant (there usually is some empty space to allow the propellant to expand and the pipe that connects the fuel tank to the engine takes up volume inside the oxidizer tank) and in how much propellant is left at burnout, but using the densities of the fuel (kerosene) and oxidizer (inhibited fuming red nitric acid) and their mixing ratio, the propellant mass can be estimated. With the weight of the missile known, this fixes the sum of the missile empty mass and payload. Parameters for the Scud-B and for the Qiam-1/ Burkan 2-H are listed in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: missile parameters used in the simulations.\n\nBased on the estimated tank volume, the Qiam-1 and Burkan 2-H can carry almost 25 percent more propellant than the basic Scud-B. Since the engine propellant burn rate is fixed, the burn time is increased proportionally. The thrust-to-weight ratio from the video indicates that the overall mass of the Qiam-1 is only marginally larger than that of the Scud-B, which means that the sum total of the payload and the burnout mass of the booster has to be smaller. The analysis does not allow making a distinction between the two. The booster burnout mass can be expressed in the deadweight mass fraction: the mass of the booster at burnout including leftover propellant as a percentage of the mass of the booster on take-off. For the Scud-B, which is a relatively heavy design, it is 26.2%.\n\nWith a 500 kg payload, as claimed for the Burkan-1, the corresponding value for the computer model of the Qiam-1 and Burkan 2-H is 16.1%. This requires a significantly lighter missile airframe and probably less leftover propellant at burnout than on the Scud-B. Removing the stabilizing fins and introducing a shared bulkhead between the tanks can account for some of the weight reduction. Replacing the relatively heavy steel used in the Scud-B airframe with a lighter aluminum construction and a smaller and lighter guidance package can account for the rest. The 16.1 % is comparable to values achieved in other liquid-propelled Iranian missiles such as the Shahab-3. The simulations include a model for aerodynamic drag, with a slightly lower drag coefficient for the missile without fins.\n\nIf the parameter set is representative for the Burkan 2-H, the resulting missile should have sufficient range to reach Riyadh from Northwest Yemen. Results of computer simulations of maximum-range trajectories for these missiles can be seen in Figure 4. It shows graphs of the maximum range of the missile as a function of the payload.\n\nFigure 4: Range as a function of the payload for the Scud-B and Qiam-1/ Burkan 2-H.\n\nThe listed range for the Scud-B, 300 km with a 990 kg payload, is matched by the simulation. With its 500 kg payload the Qiam-1 missile range is 918 km, which is just short of the distance to the Saudi capital. However, this is the range when launched from sea level and without Earth background rotation. The December missile launch took place in a mountainous region in Northwest Yemen at a fairly high altitude. This geometry alone is enough to increase the range by a few kilometers, but the higher altitude also increases the engine thrust due to reduced atmospheric backpressure and the lower atmospheric density reduces aerodynamic drag. Furthermore, to reach Riyadh the missile has to fly towards the north-east, which means that Earth rotation further increases the range.\n\nFigure 5: Maximum range for the Burkan 2-H when launched in Northwest Yemen with a 500 kg payload (purple) and a trajectory towards Riyadh (red).\n\nFigure 5 shows a visualization of a simulated missile trajectory to Riyadh, with a launch site at an elevation of 1.8 km and with the effect of Earth rotation included. The initial trust-to-weight ratio in this simulation is 2.26, which is a near-perfect match with the acceleration measured from the launch video. Figure 5 also shows the maximum range the missile can fly when launched from the same location with a 500 kg payload, with Riyadh just in reach. Launching from a location slightly further to the Northwest puts the Muslim holy city of Medina in range. Given the territory under control of the Houthis, reaching Dubai or Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, allied with Saudi Arabia in the Yemen conflict, is only possible with this missile by reducing the payload, as they are too far east.\n\nThere is some uncertainty associated with all of the parameters and measurements, but the computer simulations of the Qiam-1 and the Burkan 2-H are consistent. Using properties of the Scud-B engine and the acceleration measured from the launch video, the computer model can reproduce trajectories that reach all the way from Northwest Yemen to Riyadh with a propellant volume that matches the tank sizes from photographs of the Qiam-1. This range is possible by using a far larger proportion of the missile take-off weight for propellant than on the basic Scud-B, with a lighter warhead and airframe construction. The required missile deadweight fraction is similar to that of other Iranian missiles.\n\nIt has been speculated that the Burkan-2H may be an indigenous Yemeni development using a North-Korean Hwasong-6 as its booster. The computer modeling indicates this is unlikely. The Hwasong-6 carries less propellant than the simulated missile. For the initial acceleration to remain the same, the deadweight fraction has to be higher. However, in that case the missile can no longer achieve the required range. The missile data does not fit the rumored Scud-D or Scud-ER either. These are usually described as longer and heavier. Scaling the vertical position in the acceleration measurements, shown in Figure 3, with a longer missile would give a larger acceleration, while a heavier missile with the same engine would actually have a smaller acceleration.\n\nOf course, it is theoretically possible that the Burkan 2-H airframe was produced in Yemen rather than in Iran. However, this would be far beyond anything previously seen from Yemen\u2019s limited industry. That also applies to the more advanced flight control system required for a missile without stabilizing fins. It is also possible that the Qiam-1 and Burkan 2-H both originate in North Korea, although there are no known North-Korean Scud variants without stabilizing fins. All in all, even without a detailed forensic investigation of the wreckage, it seems unlikely these missiles originate from anywhere other than Iran.\n\nRalph Savelsberg is an associate professor at the Netherlands Defense Academy in Den Helder, specializing in missile defense.

With the pending arrival of the three planes, the number of Philippine-operated TC-90s will climb to five.\n\nLast January 31, one of the first two delivered planes, with tail number 390, conducted its first maritime air patrol mission off Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal, Zambales.\n\nThe TC-90s have a range of over 1,000 nautical miles, and a cruising speed of 260 knots and capable of carrying eight passengers along with the pilots.\n\nAs of this time, the Navy is operating around six Norman Britten \"Islander\" patrol aircraft, four GAF \"Nomad\" planes, five AgustaWestland combat utility helicopters and one Robinson R-22 training helicopter.\n\nThe TC-90, which is part of the Beechcraft King Air aircraft family, was offered by Japan shortly after the Agreement Concerning the Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology was finalized last Feb. 29, 2016.

    "text": "Ghanaian defence spending will rise by 2.56% annually from the $177 million allocated in 2016 to hit $213.8 million by 2021 spurred by a need to equip the armed forces to counter regional terrorist threats, peacekeeping operations and the fight against maritime piracy and drug trafficking.\n\nIn a new report entitled \u2018Future of the Ghanaian Defense Industry \u2013 Market Attractiveness, Competitive Landscape and Forecasts to 2021\u2032, the Strategic Defence Intelligence (SDI) group said a significant presence of Islamic State and al Qaeda-allied militia groups in Chad, Nigeria and Niger and Mali pose security threats which justified increased Ghanaian defence spending over the next five years.\n\nAmong its key findings, the report said Ghana\u2019s military expenditure would rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.56% from $177.1 million in 2016 to a peak of $213.8 million by 2021. Cumulative armed forces expenditure is estimated to rise to $1.1 billion in the forecast period.\n\n\u201cGhana has some small arms production capabilities, but it imports most of its advanced weapon systems from external suppliers. Its imports principally comprise naval vessels, aircraft and armoured vehicles. A major portion of the defence equipment the country operates is also donated by friendly countries such as China, Germany and Canada.\n\n\u201cThe army is expected to account for the majority of the military capital expenditure, which is estimated to average 23.9% of the total defence budget during the forecast period. Per-capita defence expenditure is expected to increase marginally to $6.8 by the end of the forecast period, compared to $6.4 in 2016, due to slow population growth,\u201d the report said.\n\nFurther, the report noted that the Ghanaian market will offer numerous opportunities for suppliers of defence equipment such as fighter jets, multi-role aircraft, surveillance aircraft as well as attack and transport helicopters.\n\nDue to legal prohibitions to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), foreign defence equipment manufacturers are only allowed to enter the Ghanaian by making direct sales.\n\nAlthough Ghana continues to procure it military equipment from multiple sources, the report said China would take full advantage of the limited and relatively under-developed domestic defence production capabilities to supply nearly 44% of defence imports up to 2021.\n\nThe rest of Ghana\u2019s equipment needs would come from Russia (19.8%), Germany (11.8%), Spain (11.6%) and Canada (6.3%). Some of its recent aircraft imports include Chinese-made Harbin Z-9EH utility helicopters, Brazilian-made Super Tucano light attack/trainer aircraft, Russian-made Mi-35 attack helicopters as well as Spanish CASA C295M tactical airlifters and C-27J Spartan transport aircraft.\n\nIn November 2016, China donated $3 million worth of equipment including four naval patrol boats machine guns, rifles and ammunition. In 2012, Ghana received acquired four Chinese-made \u2018Snake Class\u2019 Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) at a cost of $68 million as part of the ongoing naval forces modernisation programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in 2007, the West African country acquired four Chinese-made Hongdu Aviation Industry Group (HAIC) K-8G advanced trainer/light attack jets. The four Harbin Z9EH utility helicopters delivered from China in October 2015 were deployed to coastal surveillance and maritime search and rescue (SAR) duties."

    "text": "Authors: Ganeshan Wignaraja and Dinusha Panditaratne, LKI\n\nThe evolution of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy since the election of a unity government on 8 January 2015 merits interest. Changes include the country\u2019s engagement with a wider range of international partners, as well as a commitment to address the country\u2019s post-conflict concerns.\n\nThese changes have been pursued within a new and overarching foreign policy framework that is perhaps less well-known \u2014 a framework of positioning Sri Lanka to become a vibrant and prosperous centre of the Indian Ocean. Developed by the post-2015 government in view of increasing prosperity and competition in the Indian Ocean, this foreign policy framework builds on Sri Lanka\u2019s established status as a non-aligned, South Asian nation.\n\nThe rise of Asia, spearheaded by China\u2019s rapid growth, has transformed the Indian Ocean into one of the world\u2019s busiest East\u2013West trade corridors. It carries two-thirds of global oil shipments and a third of bulk cargo. Growth in the Indian Ocean is robust, benefiting from a rich natural resource base, vast fish stocks and a talent pool of educated youth. Economic reforms in India, Sri Lanka and others are unleashing the private sector as the engine of growth.\n\nThe 28 dynamic economies that border the Indian Ocean across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific are expected to collectively grow at about 6 per cent per year in the next few years, compared with only 3.7 per cent for the fragile world economy. Per capita income in the Indian Ocean region is expected to nearly double from US$3200 to US$6150 between 2017 and 2025, which would make it an upper-middle income region.\n\nThis represents a huge economic opportunity for Sri Lanka, which is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka relies on open sea lanes for its imports of petroleum, food and machinery, and its exports of tea, apparel and rubber products. Sri Lanka plans to become a regional trading, logistics and finance hub, situated between the leading hubs of Dubai and Singapore. Among other initiatives, cutting red tape and prudent macroeconomic management aim to give birth to an international financial centre in Colombo Port City, which would complement the shift towards services-led development.\n\nBut four external risks threaten to compromise regional peace and prosperity. First, the Indian Ocean is at risk of heightened competition between big powers, similar to what is transpiring in the South China Sea. An impasse between these powers or a skirmish at sea could disrupt regional trade. Second, natural resources and fisheries are being depleted at unsustainable rates. Third, there are difficulties in containing maritime crimes such as people smuggling, drug trafficking and piracy. Fourth, trade protectionism is on the rise, partly due to a backlash against globalisation, disruptive technological change and a simmering emerging-market debt crisis.\n\nA key point of Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign policy since 2015 has been to revive the country\u2019s support for a rules-based regional and international order. This mirrors what Lee Kuan Yew pursued for Singapore, in the knowledge that rules protect the interests of smaller countries against larger ones. Sri Lanka has been a member of the WTO since 1995 and was a signatory of the pre-WTO General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948. The country also played a role in the development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\n\nIn an important new initiative for a rules-based regional order, the Sri Lankan government convened a landmark conference, \u2018The Indian Ocean: Defining Our Future\u2019, in Colombo during 11\u201312 October 2018. This Track 1.5 dialogue brought together over 300 senior officials and academics from over 40 Indian Ocean littoral states and major maritime users.\n\nAs an island country located in the Indian Ocean and as a smaller state that cannot afford to be a huge military power, Sri Lanka is unable to address the country\u2019s external risks alone. The government, therefore, convened this conference to understand the impact of these risks and to address them jointly with other countries in a transparent and orderly way.\n\nThis approach is a tried and tested method for successful small countries \u2014 Singapore in ASEAN, New Zealand in the Pacific, and the Netherlands in Europe \u2014 that have faced similar risks. The conference laid important groundwork for a future inter-governmental conference to arrive at a shared understanding on the future of the Indian Ocean.\n\nForeign policy, including the Indian Ocean, seems distant from most Sri Lankans\u2019 minds. But complacency would be a costly mistake. A rapidly-changing economic and geopolitical scenario makes engagement with and support for a rules-based order in the Indian Ocean fundamental for Sri Lanka\u2019s future peace and prosperity. In view of the uncertain and possibly thorny path ahead, patient yet determined diplomacy is required.\n\nGaneshan Wignaraja is the Executive Director of the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI).

    "text": "(This story originally appeared in on Dec 01, 2018)\n\nIndia is trying to strike a fine balance between the US and Russia, in terms of strategic ties and defence deals as well as combat exercises. Apart from this counter-balancing, India is also stepping-up military ties with the third pole, China, amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.\u201cIndia has been a latestarter in defence diplomacy but is now making all-out efforts despite budgetary, bureaucratic and other constraints. Indian Navy warships, for instance, have made 113 foreign port calls and held 16 exercises/coordinated patrols with different navies this year,\u201d said a senior defence official.In fact, by the time this year ends, India would have held exercises with all the P-5 countries (US, Russia, China, France and UK), apart from other powerhouses like Australia, Japan, South Africa and Brazil as well as Asean countries like Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. \u201cI don\u2019t think any other country has held such a staggering number of exercises with so many nations this year. The exercises promote strategic cooperation, military outreach, confidence-building and interoperability,\u201d said the official.In December alone, the Indian armed forces have chalked up a hectic schedule for exercises with the US, Russia and China, among others. First off the block will be the \u201cCope India\u201d between the Indian and American air forces at the Kalaikunda and Arjan Singh airbases in West Bengal from December 3 to 14.While the IAF is deploying its fighters like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Jaguars and Mirage-2000s as well as other aircraft like Phalcon AWACS, C-130Js and IL-78 refuelers, the USAF has dispatched 12 F-15 jets and three C-130H planes for Cope India.Next, the IAF and Russian Air Force will conduct the second leg of their \u201cAviaIndra\u201d exercise at Jodhpur from December 10 to 22 after the first was held at Lipetsk in Russia in September. India and China, in turn, will resume their annual \u201cHand-in-Hand\u201d land exercise at Chengdu military region from December 10 to 23 after the freeze due to the Doklam troop stand-off near the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet trijunction last year.That\u2019s not all. Russian warships will head for India\u2019s east coast to hold the \u201cIndra\u201d wargames towards end-December, even as the Indo-UK \u201cKonkan\u201d naval exercise is currently underway off Goa."

    "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 Information from government documents about a delivery of German Leopard 2 tanks to Singapore in 2017 suggest the city-state bought a new batch of tanks for its Army.\n\nAccording to the register of conventional arms exports released by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Singapore received 18 Leopard 2 main battle tanks in 2017, adding to the seven tanks the German government said it exported in 2016.\n\nThe additional delivery in 2017 brings the total number of this type of tank received by Singapore to more than 170.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown how many tanks were ordered or what variant of was delivered. It is also unknown if this latest batch of tanks are brand new or refurbished secondhand vehicles, although the former is unlikely given production of the Leopard 2A4 has ended.\n\nGerman media reports say the manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann was building Leopard 2A7s for Singapore and Qatar.\n\nGermany previously declared it exported 161 Leopard 2 tanks to Singapore between 2007 and 2012 in its reports to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms database. Singapore declared the receipt of 156 Leopard 2A4s during the same period.\n\nThe 2017 delivery forms part of the $93 million worth of conventional arms exported to Singapore from Germany that year, which also included recovery vehicles, parts for tanks, various military vehicles, training and in-flight refueling aircraft, and small arms.\n\nWhen contacted for comment regarding the 2017 deliveries, the ministry told Defense News to refer to its earlier statement. It had previously said that \u201cno other variants of the Leopard has (sic) been acquired\u201d since Singapore announced it had acquired refurbished Leopard 2A4s from Germany in 2006. Singapore announced at the time that it had acquired 96 tanks, with 66 to be refurbished and put into service, with the remaining 30 to serve as spares.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nHowever, the statement does not deny Singapore increased the number of Leopard 2A4s in its possession. KMW declined to comment about the transfer when asked by Defense News.\n\nThe Singapore Army has one active battalion of Leopard 2s, with additional vehicles assigned to training units in Singapore and Germany, where it uses Oberlausitz Military Training Area. Even accounting for those being used as a source for spares, the number acquired so far suggests Singapore has enough vehicles to equip a number of reserve units."

    "text": "NEW DELHI: The Defence Production Board , which met on February 27, is yet to take a decision on the much-delayed Rs 60,000-crore Future Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) project which is aimed at replacing an ageing Soviet-era fleet, top ministry sources said.The board deliberated on the project following the submission of a report earlier last month by a panel of Independent Expert Monitors appointed by the ministry. However, it did not take a decision on proceeding with the FICV project.\u201cThe meeting concluded that the project will have to be studied in more detail and it will be deliberated upon in the next meeting,\u201d sources said. \u201cNothing has been solved yet and everything is still in the pipeline.\u201d A top ministry source added too much time has already been spent on the project. \u201cA few more months will have to be spent on it,\u201d the source said.Five private entities, including L&T, Mahindra, Reliance Defence and units of the Tata Group, bid for the contract to make 2,610 FICVs to replace the Russian BMP-2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle, which entered service in 1981. The project has faced hurdles ever since it was approved in October 2009.The first expression of interest issued in May 2010 was retracted in December 2012 after inconsistencies in the evaluation of the responses received, said sources.The second EOI was issued in July 2015 to 10 vendors. In January 2016, the ministry approved a proposal that state-owned Ordnance Factory Board and two private companies would make the prototype of FICV.In February 2016, the ministry received responses to the EOI from L&T, Mahindra, Reliance Defence and Ordnance Factory Board along with joint bids by Tata Motors-Bharat Forge andSEDTitagarh Wagons. The ministry\u2019s acquisition wing recommended that the project either start afresh or the five private entities be selected to submit the detailed project report, explained sources.The recommendation was in contrast to the Defence Procurement Procedure of 2008, which states that the Defence Production Board should select the two best bidders to design and develop the prototype, prepare the DPR and then make the model. Following this delay, the ministry overruled the acquisition wing\u2019s recommendations and instructed the Defence Production Board to approve the bidders.The panel of Independent Expert Monitors found the evaluation process for selecting the bidders to make the prototypes was correct and recommended that the project should move forward, ET reported on February 26."

    "text": "Moscow (CNN) In Europe, a shadow conflict is capturing headlines: The Salisbury poisonings and the unmasking of alleged Russian agents in the Netherlands suggest a return to Cold War-style spy games between Russia and the West.\n\nIn Ukraine, the picture is more stark. A hot war is continuing in the eastern Donbas region, and the conflict between Moscow and Kiev appears set to escalate.\n\nThe latest flashpoint? Ukraine's bid for greater spiritual independence from Russia.\n\nOn Monday, the Russian Orthodox Church broke ties with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, the titular head of Orthodox Christianity, after Ukraine secured approval last week to establish an independent Orthodox church.\n\nThat move drew immediate condemnation from Russia, which said the decision set the stage for a potential split within the global Orthodox community.\n\nOn Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin presided over a meeting of his Security Council on the matter.\n\nPolicemen stand guard in front of the central entrance of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra monastery on October 11.\n\nDmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, said the Kremlin was \"extremely concerned,\" adding: \"If the current situation leans into the realm of illegal actions, then, of course, just like Russia protects the interests of Russian speakers, then likewise -- and Putin has said this many times -- Russia will protect the interests of Orthodox Christians.\"\n\nSuch words carry weight. In 2014, Putin justified the Crimea intervention as defending the interests of ethnic Russians. The occupation of Crimea set in motion the war in eastern Ukraine, which has claimed the lives of more than 10,000 people. And Washington is not a bystander in that conflict.\n\nFor starters, the US maintains that Russia is the aggressor. Speaking Friday with reporters in Rome, Kurt Volker, the Trump administration's point man on Ukraine, said the separatist forces in eastern Ukraine were \"100% under Russia's command and control,\" despite Moscow's insistence that the war in Donbas is a local uprising.\n\n'All from Russia'\n\n\"There shouldn't be any ambiguity about that,\" Volker said, according to a transcript. \"You have military forces that are led by active duty Russian military personnel. Russian officers are embedded through the chain of command down to the company level. Russia pays for contract soldiers to then fill out the whole military force and this goes to a Russian firm -- that then hires the soldiers and provides them to the Donbas. The training, the equipment, the troop rotations, the supplies -- all of this comes directly from Russia.\"\n\nAnd Washington has matched strong words with a deepening military partnership with Kiev.\n\nLast week, the US Air Force kicked off a military exercise in Ukraine, primarily at Ukraine's Starokostiantyniv Air Base. The so-called Clear Sky exercise will include F-15C Eagle fighters, KC-135 aerial refueling tankers and MQ-9 Reaper drones operating from Miroslawiec Air Base in Poland.\n\nUS servicemen stand in front of F-15 fighter jets during air force exercises at Starokostiantyniv Air Base.\n\nUkraine may not be a NATO member, but the Ukrainian government aspires to NATO membership. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said such exercises would bring Ukraine's military into closer cooperation with the transatlantic alliance.\n\n\"The purpose of the exercises is to increase the level of interoperability of our combat aircraft with the air forces of the United States and other member states of the alliance,\" he said . \"Five years ago, our planes rusted on the ground and military pilots forgot about the sky. But today, each of you has an opportunity to see the professional skills of our pilots \u2014 soldiers, who carry out difficult tasks on an equal footing with their foreign counterparts.\"\n\nNATO membership for Ukraine is a red line for Putin, who has said he considers expansion of the alliance a form of aggression. And the US further riled the Kremlin earlier this year, when it delivered Javelin antitank weapons to Ukraine to step up the country's military capability.\n\nThe Trump administration's support for Ukraine has undergone something of an evolution, however. Senior officials have consistently stated that the US government does not see Russia's annexation of the peninsula as legitimate, and the US government and its European allies have maintained sanctions on Russia since the annexation of Crimea.\n\nPolish F-16 fighter jets during air force exercises.\n\nBut both before and after taking office, President Donald Trump made statements that appeared to cast doubt on his commitment to Ukraine's claims over the peninsula, both blaming the Obama administration for losing the peninsula and suggesting the people of Crimea would rather be in Russia.\n\nThe issue of arming Ukraine has also not been clear-cut. While the Republican presidential platform was being drafted in 2016, Trump campaign officials watered down language about supplying lethal aid to Ukraine. Speculation immediately fell to the possible role of Paul Manafort, then the chairman of the Trump presidential campaign: He had done years of lobbying work for the pro-Russian political party of Ukraine's then-president, Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nYanukovych fled Ukraine for Russia in February 2014 after street demonstrations toppled his government. Manafort was convicted in August on tax fraud and bank fraud charges, and his legal ordeal is not over\n\nHarder line\n\nAgainst that background, Trump administration officials have been maintaining a harder line on Russia's role in Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, the US Embassy in Kiev posted a link to images taken with a drone over eastern Ukraine by monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's special monitoring mission to Ukraine, an unarmed, civilian mission that monitors the conflict. The drone observed vehicles, including a truck carrying an armored personnel carrier, going in and out of Ukrainian territory through an unpaved road in a rebel-held area near the border with Russia.\n\nIn a non-government controlled area of Donetsk region near the border with the Russian Federation, an SMM UAV again spotted convoys of trucks along a dirt road where there is no border crossing facility in the middle of the night. One of the trucks carried an anti-aircraft gun. pic.twitter.com/sJ6HUmdSSr \u2014 OSCE SMM Ukraine (@OSCE_SMM) October 12, 2018\n\n\"Russia must stop providing deadly weapons under cover of night to its proxies in eastern Ukraine,\" the US embassy said on Twitter. \"These weapons, including those @OSCE_SMM spotted by UAV, kill soldiers & civilians alike. Only Russia can bring an end to bloodshed in Ukraine.\"\n\nIn Minsk on Monday, Moscow Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, convened a synod to respond to the latest developments over Ukraine's move to distance itself from the Russian church.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Kirill met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia."

The following day, Gen. Gilbert Diendere, the head of the presidential guard, declared himself the country's new leader.\n\nThe move was met with resistance by citizens, which led to violent protests in the street. It was also condemned by the Burkina Faso military and other government loyalists, as well as the international community, including the African Union.\n\nArmy loyalists gave Diendere an ultimatum Monday, telling him to step down or face a military attack.\n\nA deal was signed late Tuesday between the two sides. Diendere agreed to stand down from the positions the rebels had taken in the capital Ouagadougou, while the army also agreed to withdraw its troops and guarantee the safety of the rebel presidential guard members and their families, according to reports by Mail & Guardian Africa.\n\nThe attempted military coup comes just weeks before national elections were to take place on Oct. 11. The elections were seen as a means to stabilize the country, since they will be the first to take place since former President Blaise Compaore was toppled last October.\n\nRELATED: Reflecting on the Burkina Faso Uprising"

    "text": "Harsha Kakar\n\nRecent reports indicate that China is moving at a fast pace to annex Pakistan as one of its provinces. In other countries where China has invested, and the nations have been unable to pay, they have had to hand over strategic assets to China for prolonged durations, Sri Lanka and Myanmar being examples. In the case of Pakistan, China already has strategic control over its major asset Gwadar, as also of almost all its mineral wealth.\n\nThe first report was of China granting Pak an additional USD $ 500 Million as loan to Pak for it to tide over its financial crises. The Pak economy is in dire straits with diminishing foreign exchange reserves. The loan was granted at a rate of 4.5%. This is the second loan Pak has taken from the same Chinese bank, the earlier being in Oct last year of the same amount. Pak\u2019s dire financial state is being well exploited by China.\n\nThe second was of the Pak senate \u2018recommending courses of the official Chinese language being launched for current and prospective Pak CPEC human resource\u2019. This contrasts with other nations, where those investing learn national language and customs of the countries in which they are operating. Hence, Pak appears to be bending backwards to satisfy China.\n\nThe third report pertains to the Pak government examining a proposal to replace the US dollar with the Chinese Yuan for trade between the two nations after reports emerged that China had \u2018temporarily\u2019 suspended funding for the CPEC over corruption issues. The exchange rate of the Chinese Yuan is controlled by the Chinese government hence Pak would end up losing rather than gaining.\n\nThe fourth was of the Chinese government bypassing the Pak military and directly negotiating with the Baluch Liberation Front(BLF) for ensuring security to the CPEC in \u2018troubled\u2019 Baluchistan. There are reports of China bribing the freedom fighters. Thus, they would be free to target the Pak army and leave the CPEC, which would benefit China. Though the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson denied the same, however comments by Pak were contrary. Pak\u2019s comments were guarded stating that anyone could interact with the BLF, if it benefitted the nation.\n\nFifthly, is China\u2019s support to the JeM and its leader Masood Azhar. It has repeatedly blocked the UN from designating him as a global terrorist. It is this group which has been responsible for most recent strikes in India, including Pathankot and Sunjuwan. Thus, it would now appear that China would soon be controlling anti-India operations of the ISI. Sixthly, is the increased presence of Chinese troops even as far south as Rajasthan, constructing defences for the Pak army.\n\nSeventhly, there are reports of China constructing a naval base at Jiwani, near Gwadar. While Gwadar is already on a forty-year lease to China, this base would enable China to officially deploy forces in Pak. For the present both China and Pak have denied the same. Finally, a consortium of three Chinese bourses have purchased a forty percent ownership of Pakistan\u2019s only stock exchange in Karachi, thereby gaining control over the Pak economy.\n\nPak did appear to indicate some strength of character by cancelling the Daimer-Bhasha dam project to be constructed with Chinese funding, stating difficult financial terms. However, the deep penetration by China in every aspect of Pak society continues unabated.\n\nDiplomatically, militarily and economically Pak is already completely dependent on China. It has slowly taken over the Pak economy, supplies maximum military hardware to them and when international agencies refuse to grant them loans, it comes to the rescue. Diplomatically, it continues to shield Pak in international forums, employing its veto to protect Pak from being censured. Now it appears to be becoming more deeply involved with the country.\n\nIts talks with the BLF is clearly a direct interference in the internal affairs of Pak and goes against the very character of the state. India would never permit any nation to interact directly with any group or leader who operates against the state. The very desire of the Pak NSA to meet the separatists or their being invited by the Pak Consulate for talks had led to calling offofficial dialogue between the two nations. In Pak\u2019s case it gave a rather muted statement.\n\nSo evident is the control that the murder of one Chinese national in Pak, has the government on edge. China demands arrest of those responsible, which the local authorities fail to ensure, only adding to further pressure from China. Pak has created a special force only to ensure security of the Chinese employed in the construction of the CPEC.\n\nPak is soon scheduled to commence repaying back China at an annual rate of five billion dollars a year, solely for its investment in the CPEC. This is in addition to repayment for loans it has taken for shoring up its economy from China and other international borrowers. Financially repayment may be almost impossible as most Chinese companies in Pak have special tax privileges and the earning accruing from Gwadar would be ninety percent with China. As debts mount so would Chinese demands.\n\nSince it already controls the Pak economy and Gwadar, logically the next step would be controlling its foreign policy and military. Thus, the friendship claimed to be \u2018deeper than the ocean\u2019 is the Chinese way of adding to its territory, without as much as firing a single bullet.\n\nThe recent warning of placing Pak on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list, with Chinese acceptance is adding to Pak\u2019s woes and faster takeover by China. It is known that Pak would never be able to provide a satisfied plan of action to avoid being \u2018grey listed\u2019, hence would be economically more affected. Pak would find it difficult to take international loans to survive, hence would be forced to bank on Chinese largesse, falling deeper into their trap.\n\nChina is aware, that though it may gain control of Pak\u2019s assets and even enhance its hold on the country\u2019s policy, but an economically weak nation, packed with militants and hardliners would become more of a burden than an advantage in the long term.This is the time for India to commence forcing Pak into an arms race, breaking its economy and pushing it against the wall, even adding to Chinese problems of shoring up a bankrupt Pakistan.This may compel China to restrict Pak\u2019s policy of supporting terror groups.\n\n(The author is a retired Major General of the Indian Army)"

In 2014, for instance, tensions between Vietnam and China soared due to an incident involving an oil rig in disputed waters, despite the fact that both countries had signed the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties which committed them to \u201cresolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means.\u201d Although no lives were lost, one ship was sunk. After consultations in the four capitals, HD secured a mandate and agreed to facilitate informal multilateral dialogues aimed at promoting predictability and reducing tensions in the region, beginning with the first Experts\u2019 Meeting in Singapore, held in June 2015.\n\nSince then, a number of factors have contributed to the increased complexity of the disputes in the South China Sea, not least the Permanent Court of Arbitration\u2019s 2016 ruling in favour of the Philippines against China\u2019s continued developments on land and at sea in the disputed waters."

    "text": "Canada's multi-billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia includes a substantial number of \"heavy assault\" armoured vehicles and a maintenance deal that would see the Ontario-based manufacturer embed teams at multiple locations throughout the kingdom.\n\nCBC News has obtained documents that \u2014 for the first time \u2014 lay out the major elements of the original agreement signed in early 2014 and approved by the previous Conservative government.\n\nThe $15 billion agreement was given the further blessing of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government in the spring of 2016 when it began issuing permits for the export of the combat vehicles.\n\nMuch of the heated public debate about the arms sale has taken place in a vacuum because specific details of General Dynamics Land Systems Canada's (GDLS) contract were sealed under a confidentiality agreement demanded by the Saudi government.\n\nBoth the Liberals and Conservatives have used the absence of details to downplay the destructive firepower of the vehicles being sold.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper once described them as \"trucks.\" Before the last election, Trudeau called them \"jeeps.\"\n\nCBC News has obtained internal records that show the deal struck in February 2014 involved 928 of the most modern light armoured vehicles, known as the LAV 6.\n\nOf those, almost 40 per cent \u2014 354 \u2014 are standard troop carriers.\n\nThe order also includes 119 LAV 6 vehicles of the \"heavy assault\" type, with powerful 105 millimetre canons affixed to their turrets, which were still under development at the time the documents were written.\n\nAnother 119 are configured as \"anti-tank\" vehicles and a further 119 are designated as \"direct fire\" support, with a two-man turret and 30 millimetre chain gun.\n\nThe remaining vehicles include ambulances, mobile command posts, VIP transports and recovery vehicles equipped with cranes.\n\nSaudis want details kept quiet\n\nThere has been talk in the defence industry that some details of the order have been modified over the last four years, and that it's possible fewer vehicles may be sold.\n\nThe company was asked to comment on the documents and the current status of the deal.\n\n\"General Dynamics declines to comment due to contractual and confidentiality reasons,\" said Doug Wilson-Hodge, manager of corporate affairs at General Dynamics Land Systems.\n\nDelivery of the first vehicles was slated to begin in early 2017, according to internal Global Affairs Canada emails obtained by CBC News under access to information legislation.\n\nThese are combat-ready vehicles ... certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were. - Cesar Jaramillo, Project Ploughshares\n\nThe government agency that brokered the deal \u2014 the Canadian Commercial Corporation \u2014 also refused to discuss the documents.\n\n\"All details of the contract remain commercially confidential,\" said an unsigned email from the agency.\n\n\"Further, the documents you mention below are not internal to CCC nor the Government of Canada, therefore, we decline to comment.\"\n\nInternal government emails, obtained in 2015 by The Globe and Mail, show the Saudis stipulated that releasing the details of the deal would amount to \"breaking the terms of the contract.\"\n\nStephen Harper personally reassured the late Saudi King Abdullah, in writing, that Ottawa would hold up its end of the bargain, the newspaper reported.\n\nDeal includes 14-year support program\n\nDefence experts and human rights advocates, particularly those who have fought the deal, said the documents represent the first clear snapshot the Canadian public has seen of what the government is allowing to be exported.\n\n\"These documents raise very important questions and I think our understanding of what was announced in 2014 has to change, needs to change,\" said Cesar Jaramillo, the executive director of Project Ploughshares.\n\n\"This shows us that these are combat-ready vehicles and certainly not the jeeps that the government once told us that they were.\"\n\nA Southern People's Resistance militant loyal to Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi mans an anti-aircraft machine gun the militia seized from the army in al-Habilin, in Yemen's southern province of Lahej, March 22, 2015. There are concerns among human rights groups that the Saudis could use Canadian-made armoured vehicles against Houthi fighters in Yemen. (Nabeel Quaiti/Reuters)\n\nThe records obtained by CBC News show the contract between London, Ont.-based GDLS and the Saudis goes much deeper than just than just selling the vehicles.\n\nIt also involves a 14-year support program that covers ammunition, crew \"training in Canada/Europe\" and \"embedded\" maintenance, with a fleet management team in 13 workshops.\n\nThe reference to Europe has to do with training Saudi crews on the gun system, slated to take place in France.\n\nThe service agreement in Saudi Arabia would be delivered through a subsidiary of the Canadian manufacturer located in Riyadh, said the documents obtained by CBC News.\n\nThe support deal is significant on a couple of different levels, said Dave Perry, an expert in defence procurement at the Canadian Institute of Global Affairs.\n\nFor starters, it partly explains the enormous price tag. Most of the value in defence deals today is not in the hardware, but in the long-term maintenance and support services being provided, said Perry.\n\nIt could give Canada \"a fairly significant amount of leverage\" going forward, he added, pointing out that the support deal could be used to apply diplomatic pressure in the event Canada has new concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record.\n\n\"If we are simply selling them a piece of equipment and walking away, you don't really have much recourse afterwards to do anything, if they do something that you don't want,\" he said.\n\nRe-examining arms exports\n\nLast summer, images surfaced online that showed Canadian-made armoured vehicles, manufactured by another company, being used by the Saudi state in its long-running conflict against the Shiite population in Qatif, a restive portion of eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nOne of the video clips also showed a light armoured vehicle, apparently manufactured by GDLS, operating in the region of Awamiyah.\n\nThe Liberal government launched an investigation, which ended with \"no conclusive evidence that Canadian made vehicles were used in human rights violations.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland supported the findings, but told a House of Commons committee a few weeks ago that the review caused her to re-examine the arms export system.\n\nAt the same time, the Liberal government introduced amendments to Bill C-47, which allows Canada to join the global arms trade treaty. The changes would, when passed, give the federal cabinet broader powers to deny export permits if there is the \"substantial risk\" of human rights violations.\n\nReleasing the report\n\nFreeland has shown no appetite to revisit the Saudi deal.\n\n\"Let's be clear, from this day forward, I want us to hold ourselves to a higher standard on the export of controlled goods from Canada,\" Freeland said. \"On a matter of principle, Canada will honour, to the greatest extent possible, pre-existing contracts. We can all understand and appreciate the fundamental importance of being able to trust Canada.\"\n\nOfficials in Freeland's office would not answer questions directly related to the leaked documents on Monday. Instead, a spokesman pointed to the ongoing debate over over Bill C-47.\n\n\"We are committed to a new and higher standard for arms exports,\" Adam Austin said in an email.\n\nJaramillo said it would be in the public's interest for the Liberals to release a copy of their recent investigation and to explain how they came to the conclusion that no abuse took place in eastern Saudi Arabia involving Canadian vehicles.\n\nReleasing that investigation report, he said, shouldn't have any effect on the current sale.\n\n\"Before they invoke commercial confidentiality, to shield the Canadian public from this important information, I just want to point out that I don't see how an independent government investigation into human rights violations would interfere at all with the commercial confidentiality of GDLS,\" he said."

Next year, the country aims to purchase 210 infantry fighting vehicles, multi-purpose helicopters, and mobile air defense radars (MADRs), among other systems.\n\nMetnar said that in 2018 the ministry managed to conclude deals to purchase weapons and military equipment worth more than 14.5 billion koruna (US $635 million). There is a consensus across the country\u2019s political spectrum that the country\u2019s defense spending must be further increased in the coming years, the minister said, as reported by local daily Denik.\n\nWith F-16 buy, Slovakia \u2018cutting off\u2019 Russian hardware NATO member Slovakia is on track to purchase 14 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighters to replace its MiG-29 jets in a wider effort to break from Russia, a defence ministry official said Saturday.\n\nThe planned acquisitions are largely focused on replacing the military\u2019s Soviet-designed gear with new equipment made by Western allies and Czech manufacturers. The region-wide trend has accelerated following Russia's military intervention in eastern Ukraine and its annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, Lt. Gen. Ales Opata, the Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, said at a joint press conference with Metnar that the key to military modernization was the upgrade of the country\u2019s land forces."

    "text": "India\u2019s Republic Day on 26 January 2018 was a unique occasion: Leaders of 10 ASEAN countries were chief guests at the grand parade in New Delhi. Their presence marked a major milestone in India\u2019s outreach to East and Far East nations in a bid to mount a challenge to China\u2019s dominance in the region. The contestations taking place in the broad Indo-Pacific expanse is the 21st century version of the Great Game of the 19th century between Great Britain and Russia and is pitting US, India and Japan against a rising and increasingly assertive China.\n\nIndia\u2019s Act East Policy\u2014successor to the Look East Policy initiated by Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in 1992\u2014has received fresh impetus. Apart from rising competition in the ASEAN region, China\u2019s increasing forays into the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal over the past decade has imposed greater responsibility on the Indian Navy. Consequently, its role has increased in India\u2019s strategic decision-making. And for once, the government is putting its money where its mouth is. Since 2014, the Modi government has moved swiftly to plug gaps in India\u2019s maritime sector and pushed the navy to do more bilateral exercises and send additional ships for overseas deployment in comparison to previous governments.\n\nFor instance, there were seven overseas deployments, Operational Turnarounds (OTS) and surveillance of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) for friendly countries such as Mauritius, Seychelles and Maldives in 2014. That number quickly doubled in 2015 and 2016.\n\nNew Delhi has also reached out to the Indian Ocean littoral states, allocated more resources for bilateral and multilateral naval exercises and finalised the development of two islands for future Indian military bases in the smaller but strategically located countries\u2014Mauritius and Seychelles\u2014besides bolstering the development of military and civil infrastructure of its island territories, the Andaman and Lakshadweep islands.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Modi\u2019s three-nation tour of the Indian Ocean countries in March 2015 starting with Sri Lanka and then to Mauritius and Seychelles, India\u2019s intention to further strengthen India\u2019s long-standing ties with all the three countries got a boost. That time, Modi\u2019s team decided to finalise the lease of two islands\u2014one each in Seychelles and Mauritius\u2014that had been under negotiation for some years. Located in the Western Indian Ocean, these small islands are now being developed with the required infrastructure needed for naval ships transiting through the waters of the western Indian Ocean. This is part of India\u2019s plan to help the Indian Ocean littorals in strengthening their maritime domain awareness capabilities.\n\nDuring the Modi visit\u2014again a first by an Indian Prime Minister in more than three decades\u2014four agreements, including one on maritime security, were signed.\n\nIndia and Seychelles also declared that India will be leasing Assumption Island, one of the 115 islands that comprise Seychelles. It is an uninhabited island, near the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. Along with the Suez Canal, the Mozambique Channel is one of the two main routes for shipping between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. Naval observers have noted that New Delhi\u2019s plans in the Western Indian Ocean are in response to the increasing Chinese forays into the Indian Ocean and hiring Djibouti as the PLA Navy\u2019s first overseas military base\n\nIn Mauritius too, India already has a foothold. Both the security adviser and the head of the Mauritian Navy/Coast Guard have been Indian Naval officers for decades, India had for long resisted basing Indian Military hardware on the Island. That has changed.\n\nIndia is upgrading airfield and port facilities at North Agalega Island, located some 1000 km northeast of Madagascar, for use by the Indian military. This has long been discussed but never acted upon. Using Agalega as a staging point will substantially help India\u2019s maritime reconnaissance efforts throughout the western Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Indian Navy is accordingly gearing up for the upcoming strategic competition with the PLA Navy. Several new plans\u2014from speeding up infrastructure building in Andaman and Lakshwadeep islands to acquiring more assets and inducting more personnel\u2014are now taking off\n\nIndia\u2019s annual joint naval exercise with the United States\u2014Exercise Malabar\u2014is now officially a trilateral one with Japan joining the manoeuvre in the 2017 edition. India\u2019s signing the LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement) in August 2016, after years of hesitation, was a breakthrough moment in Indo-US military ties. On the discussion table for at least 11 years, the previous government was unwilling to take the plunge for fear of being branded \u2018pro-US\u2019, but Prime Minister Modi and his national security team appears to have overcome the hesitation and signalled an unequivocal shift towards a greater defence, especially maritime, cooperation with the United States and its allies.\n\nPart of the reason to go ahead and clinch the LEMOA is also perhaps New Delhi\u2019s way of signalling to Beijing that India is willing to go further than it has gone so far, in maintaining a balance of power in Asia and disallowing China a free run in the geopolitics of the continent. In that context, a tailor-made agreement for India, the diluted LSA, now called the LEMOA, is just the right message to China in the ongoing tussle for influence in Asia. The clarifications notwithstanding, the implementation of LEMOA will be watched keenly by long-time India ally Russia. Moscow has been wary of the increasing India-US bonhomie for the past decade. Consequently, it has made its displeasure clear at being displaced as India\u2019s primary military hardware supplier by the US a number of times. How it will react to the new development will be a matter of interest within the country and to the rest of the world.\n\nThe writer is a strategic affairs analyst, author and founder of BhartShakti.in, a specialised defence website"

It has been done to shorten the procurement process since the financial powers of the DGs have been upgraded.\u201d\n\nAn official said state governments have also been allowed to import for security purposes by amending exemption rules of foreign trade. The latest notification also scrapped the provision which allowed exemptions to Directorate General Supplies and Disposals, which was shut last year."

REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo\n\nThe comments, by Vladimir Kozhin, an aide to President Vladimir Putin who oversees Russian military assistance to other countries, follow a visit to Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, who has been lobbying Putin hard not to transfer the missiles.\n\nRussia last month hinted it would supply the weapons to President Bashar al-Assad, over Israeli objections, after Western military strikes on Syria. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes had removed any moral obligation Russia had to withhold the missiles and Russia\u2019s Kommersant daily cited unnamed military sources as saying deliveries might begin imminently.\n\nBut Kozhin\u2019s comments, released so soon after Netanyahu\u2019s Moscow talks with Putin, suggest the Israeli leader\u2019s lobbying efforts have, for the time being, paid off.\n\n\u201cFor now, we\u2019re not talking about any deliveries of new modern (air defense) systems,\u201d Izvestia cited Kozhin as saying when asked about the possibility of supplying Syria with S-300s.\n\nThe Syrian military already had \u201ceverything it needed,\u201d Kozhin added.\n\nThe Kremlin played down the idea that it had performed a U-turn on the missile question or that any decision was linked to Netanyahu\u2019s visit.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\n\u201cDeliveries (of the S-300s) were never announced as such,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call, when asked about the matter.\n\n\u201cBut we did say after the (Western) strikes (on Syria) that of course Russia reserved the right to do anything it considered necessary.\u201d\n\nThe possibility of missile supplies to Assad along with its military foray into Syria itself has helped Moscow boost its Middle East clout. with Putin hosting everyone from Netanyahu to the presidents of Turkey and Iran and the Saudi king.\n\nISRAELI LOBBYING\n\nIsrael has made repeated efforts to persuade Moscow not to sell the S-300s to Syria, as it fears this would hinder its aerial capabilities against arms shipments to Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. Israel has carried out scores of air strikes against suspected shipments.\n\nOn Thursday, Israel said it had attacked nearly all of Iran\u2019s military infrastructure in Syria after Iranian forces fired rockets at Israeli-held territory. S-300s could have significantly complicated the Israeli strikes.\n\nThe missile system, originally developed by the Soviet military, but since modernized and available in several versions with significantly different capabilities, fires missiles from trucks and is designed to shoot down military aircraft and short and medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nThough since been superseded by the more modern S-400 system, the S-300s are still regarded as highly potent and outstrip anything that the Syrian government currently has.\n\nSyria currently relies on a mixture of less advanced Russian-made anti-aircraft systems to defend its air space.\n\nRussian media on Friday were actively circulating a video released by the Israeli military which showed an Israeli missile destroying one such system -- a Russian-made Pantsir S-1 air defense battery -- on Thursday in Syria."

The missiles will also be installed on the secondhand CVR(T) vehicles the country purchased from the U.K., according to the Latvian ministry.\n\nUnder the plan, the missile systems will be gradually integrated with Latvia\u2019s military units by 2023.\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine and the subsequent annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula by Russia in 2014 has pushed the Baltic states to intensify their efforts in expandiing combat capacities."

Many times, soldiers have been hit even in their own posts, besides being targeted when they are out patrolling.\n\nEven though the Indian Army has retaliated in equal terms, the need was felt for more modern and deadlier sniper rifles.\n\nAlso read: The new danger in Kashmir: Cold, calculating snipers who are wary of close contact\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the new rifles?\n\nThe US-made Barrett M95 is an anti-material rifle which has a range of 1,800 metres. The gun, which is in use with many special forces around the world, is a bolt action sniper rifle chambered in a .50 Browing Machine Gun cartridge (12.7\u00d799mm).\n\nWith an unloaded gun weighing about 10 kg, the M95 first came out way back in 1995, and is part of the Barrett M82 family, the first notable American-made .50 Caliber anti-material rifle introduced in 1982.\n\nThe gun feeds from a five-round detachable box magazine and is a more compact and lighter version than earlier products.\n\nThe other gun that will be available to the troops along the LoC is the Victrix Armaments\u2019 .338 Lapua Magnum Scorpio TGT, owned by Italian firm Beretta.\n\nThe Scorpio TGT uses the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6\u00d770mm or 8.58\u00d770mm), a rimless, bottlenecked, centre-fire rifle cartridge.\n\nIt was developed in the 1980s as a high-powered, long-range cartridge for military snipers. It was used in the Afghanistan War and the Iraq War.\n\nAlthough the .338 Lapua Magnum was initially developed to penetrate body armour at 1,000 metres, it has been used effectively to 1,500 metres and beyond, and holds the distinction of being part of some of the record-breaking sniper shots in war.\n\nAt least 30 countries use the .338 Lapua Magnum sniper rifles and over a dozen manufacturers produce rifles, in multiple configurations, in this calibre.\n\nAlso read: Militant snipers add grisly new chapter to Kashmir insurgency with three kills\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

Part of GDIT\u2019s rationale for acquiring CSRA was its belief the federal IT market is a consolidating market, and in order to effectively compete for larger contracts it needed to expand.\n\nIn that sense, the biggest influence on General Dynamics portfolio will be among civilian agencies, particularly State and Justice departments and the Homeland Security Department, according to data company Govini. That said, CSRA will expand the past performance of General Dynamics\u2019 technology services within the DoD by 93.3 percent, according to the Govini report.\n\n"

    "text": "The Tunisian Navy has commissioned two new vessels into service: its second Multi Service Offshore Patrol Vessel from Damen and a third locally manufactured patrol boat.\n\nThe vessels were commissioned at the port of La Goulette on 25 June by President Beji Caid Essebsi, according to the Tunisian Presidency, to coincide with the 62nd anniversary of the national army. The ceremony included demonstrations by the Tunisian Navy which saw boarding operations by Navy RHIBs and the deployment of sailors onto a vessel by UH-60 helicopter.\n\nThe second Multi Service Offshore Patrol Vessel (MOPV) 1400, named Syphax (P611), was taken into service along with the Kerkouane (P212) patrol boat.\n\nTunisia ordered four MSOPV 1400 vessels from Damen in 2016, with the first of class, Jugurtha (P610), delivered in March this year. The vessels are being constructed at Damen\u2019s shipyard in Galati in Romania, with Syphax being completed on 2 May. The other two vessels on order (Hannon and Sophonisbe) will be delivered by the end of 2018, according to Minister of National Defence Abdul-Karim al-Zubaidi. Hannon, began sea trials on the Black Sea on 26 June.\n\nThe MSOPV 140s have a length of 72 metres, a beam of 12.7 metres and a draft of 3.75 metres. The vessels displace approximately 1 284 tonnes and are powered by two Caterpillar engines delivering a total of 7 060 kW, giving a top speed of 20 knots.\n\nThe MSOPV is Damen\u2019s second generation offshore patrol vessel design and incorporates Damen\u2019s Sea Axe hull shape for superior seakeeping \u2013 the new OPV is fuel efficient and capable of speeds up to 25/26 knots, Damen said.\n\nA Multi-Mission Bay can be equipped with dedicated mission modules and a nine metre RHIB (rigid-hulled inflatable boat), which can be launched over a dedicated slipway through the rear of the vessel while the OPV is sailing. The Multi-Mission Hangar is capable of storing a helicopter and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\n\nThe Kerkouane was locally built by the Societe de Construction Industrielle et Navale (SCIN) in partnership with the ministry of defence and was launched on 8 May this year. The first of class, Istiqlal (P201), was launched in August 2015 and the second, Utique (P211) was launched in March this year.\n\nThe 80 ton vessels are 26.5 metres long and 5.8 metres wide. They are powered by two Rolls-Royce engines, each of which produces 3 200 horsepower, giving a top speed of 25 knots and a range of 600 nautical miles. Armament includes a 20 mm cannon and two machineguns. Accommodation is for a crew of 12 sailors. The vessels are fitted with a thermal imaging camera.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the ceremony on 25 June, al-Zubaidi said Tunisia has benefitted from the delivery of new assets over the last two years, including the offshore patrol vessels, UH-60 helicopters, 400 trucks and 30 armoured vehicles."

    "text": "Mali\u2019s air force has taken delivery of four Embraer Super Tucano light attack and trainer aircraft after placing the order three years ago.\n\nThe four aircraft (PT-ZTN, PT-ZTI, PT-ZTJ and PT-ZTF) were seen in Recife on 7 July during their delivery flight from Brazil. They stopped there overnight before heading on to Mali, where they arrived on 10 July. They were officially received by President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita the following day at Air Base 101, together with other dignitaries that included Prime Minister Soumeylou Boub\u00e8ye Ma\u00efga, and Chief of the Air Force General Souleymane Bamba.\n\nKeita said the arrival of the new aircraft was part of the rejuvenation of the country\u2019s military and that the need for aircraft was great in such a large nation.\n\nMali signed a contract with Embraer for the six aircraft at the Paris Air Show on 15 June 2015. Embraer said the contract includes logistic support for the operation of these aircraft and also provides a training system for pilots and mechanics of the Mali Air Force. Ten pilots and 17 technicians have been trained on the new Super Tucanos.\n\nIt is understood that the four aircraft delivered are configured for light attack and close air support. It had been suggested the remaining two would be fitted with surveillance systems and used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, including border patrol, but sources indicate the last two were cancelled in order to save money. It has been alleged that Mali\u2019s Super Tucanos were delivered without sighting systems due to American reluctance to supply sighting equipment.\n\nThe first two aircraft for Mali were first seen undergoing test flights in November and December 2016 at Bacacheri Airport in south-eastern Brazil.\n\nBamba said that during the first half of 2018, Mali\u2019s Air Force flew 1 068 missions, accumulating 1 696 flight hours. This included 75 medical evacuations and the transport of 25 prisoners. Reconnaissance aircraft carried out 410 missions, transport aircraft transported over 9 000 people and 78 tons of cargo and combat aircraft flew 359 missions during which they fired 155 rockets and 582 23 mm rounds.\n\nThe Super Tucano delivery is the latest in a series of acquisitions for Mali\u2019s Air Force, which has received nearly a dozen new aircraft over the last couple of years. In October 2017 Keita welcomed the delivery of new aircraft to the country\u2019s Air Force, including a C-295W transport, two Y-12 light utility aircraft, two Mi-35M combat helicopters and a Super Puma transport helicopter.\n\nThe two Y-12E light transport aircraft were delivered from China in early September 2017 and joined a number of Basler BT-67 turboprops in Malian service. The delivery of the two Mi-35Ms was confirmed by Rosoboronexport on 3 October. The Mi-35M sale was announced last year. According to the EU Training Mission in Mali\u2019s September newsletter, Mali has another two Mi-35Ms on order and these will be delivered by 2019.\n\nMali is expanding its Air Force and taken delivery of new transport, attack and training aircraft. In October 2016 the country received its first of two H215 Super Puma helicopters from Airbus Helicopters (purchased for $18 million) and that December a single C295W transport from Airbus Defence and Space. The C295W is being used to provide logistics support, medical evacuation, and troop transport capabilities to the Malian military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs noted by the EU Training Mission, in January 2016 Keita announced the implementation of a military investment plan to the value of 1,230 billion CFA. This plan formed part of the \u201cMilitary Orientation and Planning Law (Loi d\u2019orientation et de programmation militaire, LOPM)\u201d, approved in February 2015. This covers the modernisation of the Malian Armed Forces and the recruitment of 10 000 volunteers. The Malian Armed Forces should number 20 000 by 2019. The plan also includes the reorganisation of the Air Force and the purchase of new aircraft."

The aircraft arrived at Air Station London, Timehri late this afternoon to a water salute.\n\nCommander of the GDF\u2019s Air Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Courtney Byrne explained to the Department of Public Information (DPI) the planes will be able to effectively perform 10 out of the 13 Air Corps tasks.\n\nOne of the Islander arriving to a water salute Chief of Staff of the GDF, Brigadier Patrick West [centre], Commander of the Air Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Courtney Byrne [second right] and Major Mohinder Ramjag, Officer in Command at the Flight Operations Department [second left] among other GDF officials pose in front one of the Islanders A firefighter gets a closeup look at one of the Islanders shortly after it arrived at Air Station London, Timehri\n\nByrne said the aircraft are best suited for Guyana\u2019s rough, mountainous terrain, high altitudes and short hinterland airstrips. \u201cThese aircraft can perform these missions well. They are adapted for this kind of terrain.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Minister of State, Joseph Harmon had sought supplementary provision of $484Million in the National Assembly to procure two Islanders and two Sky vans.\n\nThe Islanders that arrived today were brought in Brazil and flown across the border by a team of GDF pilots. Major Mohinder Ramjag, Officer in Command at the Flight Operations Department, led the team that flew the planes to Guyana.\n\nThe GDF will now have the planes certified and registered by the Guyana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). \u201cWe already have highly qualified pilots to fly these aircraft and we have engineers who are also qualified to maintain these aircraft,\u201d Byrne said.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Byrne assured that the refurbished planes can provide more than 30 years of service to the Air Corps.\n\nChief of Staff of the GDF, Brigadier Patrick West, and other GDF officials were on hand to witness the arrival of the aircraft. There will be an official handing over ceremony for the aircrafts tomorrow.\n\nBy: Tiffny Rhodius\n\nImages: Keno George"

In 2005, one of them \u2014 the 200-foot-long HMS Gotland \u2014 sneaked up...\n\nIn terms of modern diesel-electric submarines, it\u2019s hard to beat Sweden. In 2005, one of them \u2014 the 200-foot-long HMS Gotland \u2014 sneaked up and virtually destroyed the American Nimitz-class carrier USS Ronald Reagan in a simulated war game. That was due in part to the ultra-quiet Stirling engines that power the Gotland.\n\nThe Swedish navy, while small, has long reserved funds for submarines given its location and the likely direction of conflict.\n\nThere are many places along the Swedish coast for stealthy submarines to hide, and they would likely face Russian vessels \u2014 the kind that may try to assist in a Russian attack on Sweden, remote as it seems. The Swedish boats\u2019 unique Stirling engines, using Air-Independent Propulsion, gives Gotland\u2013 and Sodermanland-class subs an advantage compared to most navies operating conventional diesel-engine submarines.\n\nBut Sweden at one point considered nuclear submarines. The idea never left the drawing board, but had it, the vessel would have been rather unsafe for the crew \u2014 and possibly anyone else who happened to stray too close to the submarine when the reactor was active.\n\nWith design work beginning in 1957, the proposed nuclear submarine \u2014 called the A-11A \u2014 was also small even by the standards of most submarines at 159 feet long, and contained some interesting design features such as a large hull-mounted hydroplanes, according to a detailed summary by Fredrik Granholm and submarine historian and illustrator H. I. Sutton.\n\nAbove \u2014 a concept sketch for a revolving 10-tube torpedo array used in the A-10, another Swedish submarine design. At top \u2014 the A-11. Swedish military illustrations\n\nThe A-11A\u2019s initial design had six torpedo tubes in a rotating launcher \u2014 firing two at a time like a double-barreled revolver \u2014 which could not reload. That was a limitation, but the design saved on space since there was no torpedo room.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features was the nuclear reactor shielding, or rather an insufficient amount of it, according to Sutton. \u201cThe sides of the reactor compartment were minimally protected meaning that the reactor could not safely be operated in port,\u201d Sutton wrote. \u201cTherefore a diesel generator would be used for maneuvering in port.\u201d\n\nNor would you want to hang around too long in the aft engine room, near the reactor \u2014 three and a half hours at most before hazardous radiation exposure.\n\nIn any case, no sailor ever spent any time in this bizarre nuclear mini-sub, as Sweden canceled the project in 1962. Truth be told, there wasn\u2019t much of a practical use for a small nuclear-powered Swedish submarine, and the design came at an anomalous, odd period in history anyways. In the 1950s, there was a veritable nuclear mania when the world\u2019s powers imagined a future of nuclear-powered cars, trucks, airplanes \u2014 and tiny reactors for the domestic home.\n\nThose concepts didn\u2019t pan out, and by the early 1960s, the hazards of nuclear energy for military use were becoming more apparent. Sweden shifted to its diesel-powered, AIP-augmented conventional submarines \u2014 although the A-11A\u2019s design had an influence on these later hunter-killers. However, the neutral country\u2019s nuclear experiments didn\u2019t end. By the 1970s, Sweden\u2019s civilian nuclear power plants were up and running."

The publicity video was telecast on Egyptian media on the occasion of the 45th Air Force Day.\n\nThe publication of the video indicates that Egypt may already be in possession of the drones and may have signed up to buy more or them. Besides the Wing Loong, CATIC also manufactures the Harrier, a reconnaissance drone capable of long endurance.\n\nChinese firms generally do not announce sales of military wares to foreign countries.

You can't expect India to go cold turkey on that,\" Harris told the lawmakers.\n\n\"I think we ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India,\" he said.\n\nHarris was responding to a question from senator Tom Cotton who asked about the impact of the recent sanctions legislation (CAATSA) Congress passed, designed primarily with Russia in mind, and specifically countries that continue to use Russian military hardware and systems.\n\nIndia, a major consumer of Russian arms, is one of the countries that would be impacted by such a legislation.\n\n\"I supported that legislation. I still do. But I do have some concerns about potential unintended consequences among countries that, for various historical reasons, still have Russian hardware and it'd be hard to avoid Russian hardware, Senator Cotton said.\n\nHarris expressed hope to achieve some relief for the rigidity that's in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) legislation.\n\nCotton then referred to a classified letter written by Defence Secretary Jim Mattis in which he is seeking exemptions for a number of countries. India is believed to be one of those countries for which Mattis has sought exemptions.\n\n\"I assume Secretary Mattis' point in this classified letter is, do you have a country like India that's a close ally, and growing ever closer, but for historical reasons going back decades, they just rely on a lot of Russian equipment, and would really impair them and therefore, our relationship with them to try to ask them to go cold turkey immediately,\" Cotton said.\n\n\"You are correct,\" Harris said."

    "text": "Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has officially launched an Armoured Vehicle Manufacturing and Assembly Facility in Maga Maga, near Jinja, which is currently producing the Nyoka armoured personnel carrier.\n\nSpeaking at the launch at Magamaga Army Barracks on Wednesday 8 August, Museveni said Ugandans were waking up, and encouraged further local industrial participation.\n\nIn 2012 the Uganda People\u2019s Defence Force (UPDF) contracted Impala Services and Logistics, sister company of South Africa\u2019s Twiga Services and Logistics, to design a Mamba class armoured vehicle for manufacture in Uganda. In 2012 the first two Nyokas were supplied for operational evaluations. In 2013 the manufacture and assembly of the Nyoka began in earnest in Uganda under a transfer of technology programme which continues today. The Armoured Vehicle Facility at Maga Maga Barracks has produced 20 Nyoka APC and another ten are currently being produced.\n\nBrigadier General Byanyima, the Commander of the Motorised Infantry, said that there are plans to produce a further 13 Nyokas in the near future. Three of the current production lines are planned for use under a United Nations mission.\n\nSince the project started, 42 technicians have been trained to manufacture and assemble the vehicles. Under the Transfer of Skills and Technology Programme, Ugandan technicians have been trained in armour welding, pneumatics, auto-electrical and mechanical skills needed to carry out manufacture of armoured vehicle hulls and the complete assembly of the Nyoka armoured vehicles.\n\nThe Nyoka upgrades required by the Uganda People\u2019s Defence Force were based on their experience using the South African Mamba in battle. The upgrades include ballistic protection equal to NATO STANAG Level 1, shooting ports, a ballistically protected grill, air conditioning, three weapon positions on the roof, pneumatically operated rear doors, an anti-roll bar, improved braking system, infrared illuminator, improved lights and other mechanical improvements. Another requirement was that the Nyoka must use the same logistical footprint as the Buffel and Mamba.\n\nUnder the programme, armour plate is cut and bent in South Africa and shipped out to the client country for manufacture and assembly. Some armour steel is now sourced directly from Sweden, which is cut using a state of the art plasma cutter which was recently installed at the facility under the Transfer of Technology programme. Museveni hinted that in the future, steel may be sourced from Uganda rather than Sweden.\n\nThe Nyoka uses the Mamba driveline (engine, gearbox, axles), which is remanufactured while the rest of the vehicle is 100% new. The engines are remanufactured and certified in South Africa.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson explained that the establishment of the Armoured Vehicle Manufacturing Facility was driven by a careful application of acquisition resources to both acquire armoured vehicles while at the same time develop the indigenous capabilities to maintain, repair, manufacture and assembly armoured vehicles in Uganda.\n\nThe UPDF several years ago was estimated to have 40 Mambas, as well as 20 ex-South African Buffels in service according to the IISS\u2019s The Military Balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwiga Services and Logistics recently supplied four 850 Military Patrol Boats (MPBs) to Uganda under a contract from Impala Services and Logistics. Chief of the UPDF, General David Muhoozi, said plans are underway to establish a marine workshop and a pier. The Ugandan marines plan to increase their boat fleet."

To this end the Government of the Republic of Kenya acknowledges with appreciation this kind of gesture by His Highness.\u201d the Cabinet Secretary said.\n\n\n\nShe further added that, the utility of the helicopters is not only limited to support the security operations but are equally suited for combat search and rescue, casualty and medical evacuations. They are also capable for combat air escort for heavy lift helicopters.\n\n\n\nThe CS assured His Excellency Sheikh Khalifa that the helicopters will certainly be put to good use and they will make a difference in Kenya\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cooperation between the two countries and indeed the Kenya Defence Forces, recognizes the fact that peace and security cannot be achieved and maintained by a single country or military. It is through cooperation and sharing of resources and information that war on terror and other vices that fuel insecurity can be won,\u201d the CS said.\n\n\n\nCommander Kenya Air Force Major General Francis Ogolla acknowledged the opportunity given to Kenya Air Force to receive the helicopters given by the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe helicopters have come such a time when we mostly needed them in our operations both in our country and beyond,\u201d Major General Ogolla said.\n\n\n\nPresent during the event were United Arab Emirates Ambassador to Kenya Khalid Khalifa Abdullah Rashid Al Mu\u2019alla, Base Commander Laikipia Air Base Brigadier John Omenda, Joint Aviation Command United Arab Emirates Colonel Jamal Alhababi, other Senior officers, officers and service members.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "text": "German firm receives contract to configure Pakistani ATR-72s\n\nRheinland Air Service (RAS), a German firm specializing in airliner maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) as well as other support tasks, was awarded a contract by the Pakistan Navy to convert two ATR-72 aircraft for anti-submarine warfare (ASW).\n\nAlthough the company did not explicitly note that the ATR-72 would be converted, Pakistan Navy ATRs were spotted at RAS\u2019s facilities in Germany in recent weeks. RAS was contracted to re-configure two Pakistani ATR-72s, with the first slotted for delivery by the end of 2017.\n\nRAS expects additional Pakistani orders in the coming years.\n\nComment and Analysis\n\nThe current iteration of the ATR-72 ASW \u2013 currently on offer by Italian vendor Leonardo-Finmeccanica \u2013 uses the ATR-72-600 as its base platform. This aircraft is capable of ASW operations through the use of a fitted sono-buoy launcher (for underwater acoustic detection) and pylons for lightweight ASW torpedoes.\n\nThe Pakistan Navy operates the slighter smaller ATR-72-500, but this should not impact its likelihood of being an ATR-72 ASW. RAS made very explicit mention of the aircraft\u2019s use as a ASW platform, and it is worth noting that Turkey did intend to use the ATR-72-500 as the basis for its program, before shifting to the ATR-72-600 (which is currently serving as the basis for the Turkish Maritime Patrol Aircraft or TMPA).\n\nATR-72 ASWs will be a welcome addition to the Pakistan Navy\u2019s maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) fleet, which has yet to fully recover from the loss of two Lockheed Martin P-3C Orion in 2011 (from an insurgent attack on the naval base PNS Mehran). It currently has seven P-3Cs in service.\n\nDerived from a widely used commercial platform, the ATR-72 ASW is a relatively feasible and accessible platform for building a sizable MPA fleet. In fact, while Alenia Aermacchi (now Leonardo) was the first to offer the ATR-72 ASW, it is not the only available avenue. Rather, the Pakistan Navy could (and likely did) select subsystems from a variety of vendors (with RAS being selected to undertake the integration work).\n\nIf Pakistan\u2019s ATR-72 ASWs are similar in their general configuration to Turkey\u2019s ATR-72 TMPA, then it is likely the following subsystems are being integrated: a search radar, electro-optical sensors, electronic support measures (ESM), magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), integrated self-protection suite, sono-buoy launcher, and hardpoints for the fuselage sides (for lightweight ASW torpedoes)."

(PZL Mielec file photo)\n\nMIELEC, Poland --- An M28 short take-off and landing (STOL) aircraft manufactured at PZL Mielec, a Sikorsky plant in Poland, Lockheed Martin has arrived in Ecuador following a trans-Atlantic flight from Poland. The twin-engined turboprop will meet the Ecuadorian Army\u2019s need for a proven multi-role transport aircraft that can perform in diverse climates and terrain.\n\n\n\nThe Ecuadorian Army contracted for the aircraft in April this year. PZL Mielec conducted training for Army pilots and mechanics training in Poland. A Polish crew piloted the aircraft 13,500 km via Iceland and Greenland across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada, the United States and Central America to Shell Mera in Ecuador, where the aircraft was officially accepted by the Army.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that Ecuador has joined to the group of M28 aircraft users,\u201d said Janusz Zakr\u0119cki, president and general director of PZL Mielec. \u201cThe M28 aircraft\u2019s unique flight and performance attributes are ideally suited to meet the Army\u2019s missions across Ecuador\u2019s diverse climates and terrain.\u201d\n\n\n\nA proven, durable and reliable STOL aircraft, the M28 aircraft can operate from any type of runway or airstrip inaccessible by other airplanes, and can fly in extreme environmental conditions and temperatures ranging from +50\u00b0 C to -50\u00b0 C.\n\n\n\nCurrently, over 100 M28 planes are used worldwide, both in commercial and military configurations. Among other missions, they perform passenger transport, parachutist training, border patrol and supervision over fisheries. The Polish Air Force successfully uses the M28 Bryza variant for both maritime and transport operations.\n\n\n\nThe M28 aircraft weighs 7,500 kg (16,500 pounds) and can be equipped with 19 passenger seats, or transport up to 2,300 kg (5,000 pounds) of cargo, as well as perform parachute missions via the rear cabin door.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "COLOGNE, Germany \u2014 German government negotiators have approved a new defense and security direction for the country, coupling boosts in military expenditures with equal increases in foreign assistance.\n\nMonths of haggling over a new government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel culminated Wednesday as leaders of her center-right Christian Democratic Union, its sister party Christian Social Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party, or SPD, unveiled a written coalition agreement in Berlin.\n\nInsiders say the topic of defense spending ended up being relatively uncontroversial during closed-door talks, and party negotiators agreed on language that would keep Germany in line with a pledge by NATO members to annually allocate 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024.\n\n\n\nMembers of the SPD had decried that goal as unrealistic and unnecessary during last year\u2019s election season.\n\nIn what could be a nod to critics of a rigid spending goal, the coalition agreement stresses that increases in the traditional military budget would come with plus-ups in fields that also have the potential to solve or prevent global crises. Those could include delivering humanitarian aid or funding educational projects abroad.\n\nArmed drones for Germany? Merkel\u2019s would-be government sizes up defense priorities Here\u2019s a rundown of key national security topics that are up for grabs in a likely coalition of three German political parties.\n\nSpeaking in Berlin on Feb. 7, Merkel hailed the idea of a \u201cnetted security\u201d approach, in which nonmilitary instruments of power would gain greater prominence.\n\nAs a major host of refugees from war-stricken Syria and impoverished North Africa, Germany\u2019s security calculus includes removing the impetus for refugees having to stream into Europe in the first place.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiators put on hold the acquisition of armed drones for the Bundeswehr \u2014 Germany\u2019s armed forces \u2014 until lawmakers can answer all legal and ethical questions involved.\n\nAt the same time, the coalition agreement approves leasing the Israeli drone Heron TP for surveillance. The SPD blocked plans for a weapons-capable version of the aircraft last summer.\n\nAn Israeli Heron TP surveillance drone flies during a presentation to the media at the Tel Nof Air Force Base, south of Tel Aviv, on Feb. 21, 2010. (Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP)\n\nDevelopment of a so-called Euro Drone, a key capability under the emerging defense regime of the European Union, will proceed as planned, according to the document.\n\nThe Bundeswehr\u2019s slow, internal acquisition processes, negotiators wrote, are in line for a major reform effort by the end of 2019. Policies requiring EU-wide program competitions could be waived to achieve greater speed for urgently needed equipment. That also would apply for projects involving technologies deemed key for the domestic industrial base.\n\nIn addition, there are plans for a new agency devoted to developing \u201cdisruptive\u201d cybersecurity and sensitive technologies, the document states.\n\nOverall, the defense section of the coalition agreement strives to strike a balance between Germany\u2019s alliance with Washington and its place as a key player in Europe. While it pledges that Berlin would \u201cbreathe life\u201d into a common EU defense policy, it notes that the Unites States is undergoing \u201cfar-reaching change\u201d that would present great challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will react to this with offers for dialogue and cooperation,\u201d negotiators wrote, adding that members of the new government would seek additional avenues for working with the Trump administration, Congress and state governments."

    "text": "The Pentagon is \u201cvery concerned\u201d over the possible implications of Russian sanctions on defence ties between India and the US, a top defence department official has said.\n\nIndia could face sanctions for purchasing high value military defence items, in particular state-of-the-art S-400 missile defence system, from Russia under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\n\nSection 231 of CAATSA mandates secondary sanctions on those who conduct significant transactions with the Russian defence and intelligence sectors.\n\n\u201cWe understand India\u2019s concern about this and we are very concerned as well. These sanctions are intended to target Russia - not India,\u201d Joe Felter, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for South and Southeast Asia, told PTI.\n\nIndia is currently in advance stage of negotiations with Russia for five S-400 system worth an estimate $4.5 billion. The air defence system includes radar, missile launchers and command center technology.\n\nAccording to some lawmakers, the latest Indian move to purchase S-400 air defence missile from Russia could be considered as a sanctionable activity.\n\nForeign Secretary Vijay Gokhale and Defence Secretary G Mohan Kumar also expressed their concerns over this during their US visit last month.\n\n\u201cWe totally appreciate Indians concerns. It was raised in discussions during senior level meetings last month. We also are very concerned because we very much hope to maintain the momentum and the trajectory of this relationship. We want to deepen our cooperation and not to reduce it,\u201d Felter said.\n\nCAATSA was signed into law in August 2017 and went into effect in January this year. The law mandates the Trump administration to punish entities engaging in significant transaction with the defence or intelligence sectors of Russia.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about anything that\u2019s going to make it more difficult for us to cooperate. But it\u2019s just out of our hands this legislation. I can\u2019t anticipate what will actually happen. Any decision to impose sanctions is made outside of DoD,\u201d Felter said.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to building our relationship and keeping it on the current trajectory. We appreciate that that defence trade is a key activity to build this partnership. We will continue to work diligently to maintain the positive trajectory we are on with this relationship and ideally deepen and expand our defence trade,\u201d he said.\n\nReferring to the growth in India US bilateral defence trade from almost zero to $15 billion, Felter said there was tremendous growth potential for the bilateral ties.\n\nAtman Trivedi, a former State Department official under the previous Obama Administration said that triggering of sanctions on India because of S-400 deal would \u201cundermine serious American interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cToo much is at stake to allow individual defence transactions to damage a budding relationship with a promising partner like India. Before it\u2019s too late, the two countries should quietly work together to find other arrangements to address India\u2019s defence requirements,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf that is not feasible, Congress should provide India a sanctions waiver or consider a larger legislative fix that allows important US allies and partners, like India, to be exempted,\u201d Trivedi said.\n\nCara Abercrombie, a visiting scholar in the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also argued in favour of exemption for India last week.\n\n\u201cIndia warrants an exemption from these secondary sanctions, as does any country with which the US is forging new and strategically important defence relations,\u201d Abercrombie wrote in Axios, an online publication.\n\nWhile the US has become its second largest defence supplier, mainly of aircraft and artillery, India still relies heavily on Russian equipment, such as submarines and missiles, that the US has been unwilling to provide, she wrote.\n\n\u201cThese sanctions, like penalties the US imposed after India\u2019s nuclear tests in the 1990s, would sour relations. At worst, they could stoke domestic backlash and close off US defence sales to India for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cGiven bipartisan support for the US\u2013India defence relationship, Congress should grant India waiver authority under CAATSA. Without waivers, other important regional partners, like Vietnam and Indonesia, are also likely to trigger sanctions,\u201d Abercrombie said.\n\n\u201cSeventy per cent of their military hardware is Russian in origin. You can\u2019t expect India to go cold turkey on that. We ought to look at ways to have a glide path, so that we can continue to trade in arms within India,\u201d Admiral Harry Harris, Commander of US Pacific Command, told a Congressional committee last month."

    "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Super Tucano contract includes Paveway II guided bombs, laser-guided rockets and infrared sensors in addition to 12 aircraft, the United States government has revealed.\n\nThe US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on 3 August announced the possible Foreign Military Sale of 12 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, along with weapons, spares and training, to Nigeria in a contract that could be worth $593 million. Congress was notified on 2 August, but more details emerged in the US Federal Register on 28 August.\n\nIn publishing the unclassified text of the arms sales notification, the Federal Register revealed Nigeria has requested Paveway II and Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser-guidance kits and ammunition. It lists these items as \u201cmajor defence equipment\u201d valued at $29 million, while the \u201cother\u201d component of the deal, for the Super Tucanos, sensors, training and support, is valued at $564 million.\n\nThe weapons and ammunition includes 100 GBU-12 (500 lb) Paveway II Tailkits; 100 GBU-58 (250 lb) Paveway II Tailkits; 400 Laser Guided Rockets including Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) rounds; 2 000 MK-81 (250 lb) bombs; 5 000 2.75 inch (70 mm) Hydra 70 unguided rockets; 1 000 2.75 inch Hydra 70 unguided rockets (practice); and 20 000 rounds of .50 calibre machinegun ammunition.\n\nThe APKWS is a low cost semi-active laser guidance kit developed by BAE Systems which is added to unguided 70 mm rockets, turning them into precision strike weapons. Similarly, the Paveway II, developed by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, uses semi-active laser guidance to turn Mk 81 and Mk 82 general purpose bombs into guided weapons. The DSCA said the sale includes the tailkits to transform Nigeria\u2019s existing 500-lb and 250-lb bomb bodies into GBU-12s and GBU-58s respectively, and that Nigeria is also buying additional GBU-58s/Mk 81 bombs.\n\nThe proposed sale also includes seven AN/AAQ-22F electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor and laser designator turrets, spares, support equipment, facilities infrastructure and hangar construction, night vision devices, simulators, and software. Training will cover pilot and maintenance instruction and human rights and international humanitarian law. FLIR\u2019s Brite Star system comprises a large format thermal imager and colour daylight camera with laser designator for terminal guidance of laser-guided bombs and rockets.\n\nThe DSCA notice said the 12 Super Tucanos \u201cwill support Nigerian military operations against terrorist organization Boko Haram and to counter illicit trafficking in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea. The Super Tucano is a sustainable platform for counterterrorism, counter insurgency, border surveillance, and illicit trade interdiction operations. The proposed sale will support U.S. foreign policy objectives by helping Nigeria to meet shared counterterrorism objectives for the region. This proposed sale will strengthen the U.S. security relationship with Africa\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d\n\nThe prime contractor is the Sierra Nevada Corporation, headquartered in Centennial, Colorado. The company is building Super Tucanos for the Afghan Air Force and Lebanon at its US facility.\n\nEmbraer has recorded a number of orders for its Super Tucano from African countries, which see it as a low cost light attack aircraft that can also be used as a trainer. On the continent, the Super Tucano has been ordered by Angola, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Senegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force may also get second hand Super Tucanos \u2013 in February the Nigerian Air Force announced that Brazilian government had approved the sale of three second hand Super Tucano aircraft to Nigeria."

The upgrade will be done locally by the state-run Ordnance Factories Board at the cost of about $50 million.\n\n\n\nThe upgrade work will involve replacing the existing muzzle brake, breech block and associated modifications to the recoil system, apart from replacing the 130mm barrel with a 155mm barrel.\n\n\n\nThe Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) has received the final confirmation of the contract for the upgrade of 300 artillery guns after the successful user trial of a prototype.\n\n\n\n\"We have successfully enhanced the capability of the artillery gun. Its ammunition is already manufactured by ordnance factories. Recently, the Indian Army has ordered to upgrade 300 such guns,\" S. K. Chourasia, OFB Chairman, told Sputnik.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army had initiated the upgrade of the Soviet era guns in 2008 with the contract being awarded to the Israeli firm Soltam \u2014 now part of Elbit. Soltam's contract was suspended midway after allegations that it had bribed officials. Later, the government had decided to throw open the contract for domestic companies. The state-run Ordnance Factories Board participated in the tender issued by the Indian Army, competing with two other private manufacturers.\n\n\n\n\"After extensive field evaluation trial, OFB's gun has emerged as the only gun system meeting all quality requirements,\" an OFB official said.\n\n\n\nThe Indian Army plans to eventually convert all existing field guns into 155mm/52-caliber guns \u2014 wheeled, tracked, self-propelled and mounted \u2014 which will cost approximately $6 billion.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

    "text": "Chad\u2019s Air Force has officially taken delivery of two new Cessna 208B Grand Caravan aircraft configured for the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) role.\n\nThe aircraft were transferred during a ceremony on 2 May at a base outside the capital N\u2019Djamena. It was attended by US ambassador to Chad Geeta Pasi, Agence France Presse reports.\n\nThe aircraft originally arrived in Chad on 2 December 2017 and were initially used for pilot training. Maintenance and logistics training continues.\n\nAccording to The Defense Post, the United States has spent $43 million on the two aircraft as well as hangars and maintenance areas. Between 2015 and 2017 the US has provided security assistance totalling $135 million. Training is ongoing and covers things like counter-improvised explosive device, small boat operations and information sharing training. Some personnel from Chad are receiving training in the United States.\n\nIn January this year the US military said Chad\u2019s Caravans are being used as intelligence surveillance reconnaissance platforms that will be used in the fight against terrorist organisations in the region.\n\nThe US Air Force\u2019s 818th Mobility Support Advisory Squadron (MSAS) sent eight Airmen to advise, train and assist with ISR, aircraft maintenance, logistics, and security anti-terrorism at Adjikossei Air Base, Chad, between 8 and 19 January. The two-week programme consisted of classroom instruction and hands-on training for 40 Chadian airmen.\n\n\u201cWe feel like it is very important for them to receive this training now to self-sustain today so that they can progress in the future,\u201d said US Air Force Technical Sergeant Julio Figueroa, air advisor, in January.\n\nChadian Caravans are equipped with L-3 Wescam MX-15 electro-optical surveillance turrets which give a live video feed. This will help Chadians in the effort against violent extremist organizations in the region, particularly Boko Haram and potentially the Islamic State in the North.\n\nCameroon has also received two Caravan aircraft, which were delivered in January this year. Cameroonian Air Force air and ground crews underwent training on the Cessna 208 in the United States in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2016 the US Air Force Life Cycle Management Centre awarded contracts for the modification of six Grand Caravans for Cameroon, Chad and the Philippines, with a further contract for the aircraft that September."

He said, \u201cWe are excited to deliver this C-130 at a time of such great optimism. This handover pays homage to our long-valued friendship and lays the foundation for new possibilities for cooperation and interoperability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States values Ethiopia\u2019s role in peacekeeping operations and ongoing commitment as the largest contributor to UN Peacekeeping forces in the world,\u201d the US embassy said.\n\nIt appears the handover is for a C-130E that was originally donated in 2014 and subsequently refurbished. Earlier reports suggested it may be a second C-130 but this now seems unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethiopian Air Force\u2019s 15 Squadron has flown C-130s since 1998 when it received two former US Air Force C-130Bs and later two commercial L100-30 variants that were previously operated by the Ethiopian Government. It is not clear if the aircraft are still operational.\n\n* This article was upated to reflect the fact that the handover is likely for the C-130E that was donated in 2014."

    "text": "PARIS \u2014 The outlook for German foreign arms sales has strengthened, with the government coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel pushing to focus on allies in Europe.\n\n\u201cGermany clearly in their coalition paper indicated they wanted a more European approach,\u201d said Frank Haun, co-chairman of KNDS, the joint venture between KMW and Nexter. Haun spoke to Defense News at the Eurosatory trade show for land weapons.\n\n\u201cThis is the right path. This means they will find a solution.\u201d Haun is also CEO of Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. Stephane Mayer, CEO of Nexter, is the co-chairman at KNDS.\n\n\u201cThe principle is Germany is on the move,\u201d Haun said. \u201cIt is not a block. It is a process and it takes time.\u201d\n\nArms export is a highly sensitive topic in Germany, with strong debate over the use of German weapons by client nations such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, respectively heavily engaged in Syria and Yemen. A sought-after alignment of French and German arm export policy is key to KNDS. The partner companies, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Nexter, have long competed with each other, but now they seek to work cooperatively to snag opportunities in the world market.\n\nThere is little public controversy in France on arms export, on which successive governments publish an annual report to parliament, giving details of the deals won in the previous year. French media have asked the Armed Forces Ministry when this year\u2019s report will be released. Clearance of foreign arms deals lies in political hands and once policy is set, then companies can pursue their target markets.\n\n\u201cWe are not in charge of external policy of our two countries,\u201d said Mayer. \u201cHowever we wish that they find an agreement, to make things clear from the beginning on how to export the systems.\u201d\n\nIf there is political clearance for sales limited to the European market, then KNDS could focus its efforts. That includes building new factories in Europe, Mayer said. The European market for main battle tanks is worth an estimated \u20ac80 billion (U.S. $93 billion) based on an estimated park of 8,000 tanks, worth \u20ac10 million per unit, Haun said.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge market,\u201d he said, of which KNDS aims to win more than half. \u201cWe want at least 50 percent, we want to be market leader.\u201d\n\nThe German Leopard tank accounts for 40 percent of the European market, while the French Leclerc holds 3 percent, so KNDS already controls 43 percent. With an operational life of some 40 years, the sale of service and spares for the tanks would be extensive.\n\nEast European nations will likely seek to replace Russian tanks, or tanks built on Russian design, so the market potential is seen to be there. KNDS unveiled at Eurosatory its European Main Battle Tank, built by fitting the Leopard 2 chassis with a Leclerc turret and 120 mm gun. That display outside the KNDS outdoor chalet marked the market launch of a cooperative effort aimed solely for foreign armies."

Get the Newsletter\n\nDuring a January 2016 visit, the UK defense minister and his Japanese counterpart agreed to move discussions on the project to the next stage. The aim of the project is to integrate Japanese seeker technologies into the European Meteor Beyond Visual Range Air-to-Air Missile.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nIn October 2016, the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) also held their first-ever joint aerial combat drill, dubbed Guardian North 16, in Japan. The exercise involved four RAF Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, JASDF Boeing F-15J all-weather air superiority fighters and Mitsubishi F-2s.\n\nThe Eurofighter consortium, which includes the United Kingdom, unsuccessfully tried to pitch the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to Japan in 2011. The JASDF, however, opted for the U.S.-made F-35A Lightning II stealth fighter jet instead. Japan placed an order for 42 F-35 through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program in 2011. The first aircraft was handed over to the JASDF in December 2016.\n\nNevertheless, the F-35 order is an interim solution and Japan is slated to procure up to 100 new fifth-generation air superiority fighters by the 2030s. An estimated $20 billion contract is expected to be awarded in the summer of 2018 (See: \u201cJapan\u2019s Air Force to Receive 100 New Stealth Fighter Jets\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I explained in July 2016, Japan has three options for procuring for the new aircraft: \u201cFirst, develop an indigenous air superiority fighter. Second, partner with a foreign defense contractor and license-produce a new aircraft. Third, import or upgrade an existing platform.\u201d The UK-Japan joint study falls into the second option of partnering with a foreign aircraft maker.\n\nHowever, U.S. aircraft makers will remain Japan\u2019s top choice for any future fighter jet co-development projects. Last year, Japan unveiled an experimental fifth-generation fighter technology demonstrator, dubbed X-2 \u201cShinshin\u201d (formerly the ATD-X), which will be the basis for the JASDF\u2019s so-called (F-3) Future Fighter Program. As I reported last year, U.S. defense contractor Lockheed-Martin is purportedly already involved with the project in some capacity."

Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way; as a coward, running and crying.\"\"Russia was great,\" he said, explaining that the personnel as part of the operation had to fly over Russian territory.\"I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us,\" he added.Yisrael Beytenu leader and former defense minister Avigdor Liberman wrote on his Twitter account, saying, \"The US military's cautionary operation based on high-quality intelligence is evidence that the US government and the US security forces are the leading forces in fighting Islamic terrorism.\"Al-Baghdadi was a symbol of the extremist Islam, which suffered a heavy moral and operational blow,\" he continued, explaining that his death proves that terrorists are not safe wherever they are, \"including Gaza and Lebanon.\"Foreign Minister Israel Katz also congratulated Trump on Twitter for the operation, adding that the achievement \"is extremely important in the war against one of the most murderous terrorist organizations of our time\" and that the assassination is \"an important message to the free world that in a determined war, terror can be won.\"\"There is a great urgency to create a no-fly-zone in northern Syria,\" said former justice minister MK Ayelet Shaked in response to the assassination. \"It is imperative this is done to prevent the ethnic cleansing of two million Kurds, and to put radical Islamists in their place.\"She further clarified that such an act is necessary in order to \"prevent ISIS from raising its head and avenging the death of their leader.\"\"The world is a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gone,\" said former education and interior minister Gideon Saar on Twitter after Trump's press conference. \"The United States has made sure he met the end that terrorists should meet. The free world must unite in the fight against terror.\""

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The price tag of the ongoing \u201cwar on terror\u201d in the Middle East will likely top $6 trillion next year, and will reach $7 trillion if the conflicts continue into the early 2020s, according to a new report out Wednesday.\n\nThe annual Costs of War project report, from the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, puts the full taxpayer burden of fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria over the last 17 years at several times higher than official Defense Department estimates, because it includes increases in Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs spending, as well as new military equipment and personnel.\n\n\u201cBecause the nation has tended to focus its attention only on direct military spending, we have often discounted the larger budgetary costs of the post-9/11 wars, and therefore underestimated their greater budgetary and economic significance,\u201d the new report states.\n\nDirect military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan make up nearly $1.8 trillion in costs, but researchers estimate the long-term health care of veterans from those wars could equal or surpass that figure in coming decades.\n\nThey also charge that the Defense Department\u2019s base budget has grown more than $900 billion over the last 17 years because of increased missions, recruiting costs and service member benefits brought on by the conflicts overseas.\n\n\u201cHigh costs in war and war-related spending pose a national security concern because they are unsustainable,\u201d study author Neta Crawford said in the report. \u201cThe public would be better served by increased transparency and by the development of a comprehensive strategy to end the wars and deal with other urgent national security priorities.\u201d\n\nVA secretary expects fiscal 2020 budget to be the biggest ever Trump wants a 5 percent spending cut for every department next year, but his top veterans' official expects Congress to add the money back in.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

About 14,000 of that group are American troops.\n\nMore than 4 million veterans in America today served during the Iraq and Afghanistan war era.\n\nThe full report is available on the project\u2019s web site."

    "text": "Canada has finally made its case that the top of the world flies the Maple Leaf.\n\nAfter years of delay and political debate, Canada has submitted its scientific argument for control of a vast portion of the Arctic seabed, including the North Pole, to the UN body that will evaluate it.\n\nDenmark and Russia have already released their own evidence that the Pole and good bits of the sea floor around it \u2014 including any resources they hold \u2014 should belong to them.\n\n\"All of the countries involved recognize that there will have to be boundary negotiations at some future point,\" said Michael Byers, professor of international law at the University of British Columbia.\n\nLast Thursday, Canada submitted 2,100 pages of scientific evidence to prove that the continental shelf from the High Arctic islands extends past 200 nautical miles from shore. It includes a contested section of sea floor that stretches from the top of Ellesmere Island along an undersea ridge to the Pole and more than 200 kilometres past it.\n\nRussia says that same undersea ridge originates from its continental shelf. Consequently, it argues all of the sea floor alongside the ridge from Russia's coast to just past the Pole belongs to the bear.\n\nThe Danes say the ridge is associated with Greenland, so it is theirs right up to Russian territorial waters.\n\n\"Continental shelf overlaps are a normal part of the process,\" Stefano Maron of Global Affairs Canada wrote in an email.\n\n\"All five Arctic Ocean coastal states have been working collaboratively through the Arctic Ocean continental shelf workshop for the past 10 years.\"\n\nCanada was expected to file a submission five years ago that would have stopped just shy of the Pole. That submission, the result of years of research costing more than $100 million, was pulled at the last minute.\n\nDrawing lines on a map\n\nReports suggested that was due to a direct order from then-prime minister Stephen Harper, who felt the submission should be for a much larger area. Documents obtained by The Canadian Press suggest the move surprised both bureaucrats working on the file and Canada's Arctic neighbours.\n\nAdditional research expeditions were mounted every summer from 2014 to 2016, say government officials. No cost figure was provided.\n\nThursday's submission shows there is evidence to back Harper's decision, said Rob Huebert, an Arctic expert from the University of Calgary.\n\n\"It totally validates it. If you actually have a look at what has been submitted, it is a substantial chunk.\"\n\nByers and Huebert said the negotiations to come will be based more on the principle of equidistance than undersea geography. That principle holds that a maritime boundary is drawn along a line equidistant from the shores of neighbouring nations.\n\nA Danish pole?\n\nIt's still worth having done the research, said Huebert, if only to prove there's a need to negotiate.\n\n\"You had to determine you had a continental shelf. That was the first and necessary step. If we'd only gone up to the North Pole, to a very large degree we would be ceding everything the Russians and Danes were putting within their claim.\n\n\"It doesn't mean you're going to get everything you want, but now it becomes much more possible.\"\n\nByers has his doubts.\n\nHe points out that the equidistance principle will probably give the Pole to the Danes. Canada's submission tacitly acknowledges that, he said, because it stops partway along the ridge.\\\n\n\"Why bother spending hundreds of millions of dollars mapping the seabed in an area you know will fall to the other country at the conclusion of negotiations?\" Byers asked.\n\n\"Our scientific claim might be valid. The North Pole is on the Danish side of an equidistance line.\"\n\nThe people who actually live in the Arctic welcome the federal submission.\n\n\"I'm pleased Canada has done this work,\" said Monica Ell-Kanayuk of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference. She noted the submission was made in consultation with Inuit.\n\nThe UN Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf will review the validity of the science done by all three countries. It's expected to be years before negotiations begin."

    "text": "TEL AVIV: The Israeli Air Force (IAF) may delay the acquisition of a third Lockheed Martin F-35 squadron in favor of a fast purchase of additional new versions of the F-15.\n\nIn recent deliberations within the IAF\u2019s high command, the leading direction was clear \u2013 -priority for the additional F-15\u2019s while delaying the purchase of a third F-35 squadron.\n\nHowever, the head of the IAF\u2019s aircraft department, Col. H., told Breaking Defense that the force will soon face the decision whether to purchase additional F-35s, on top of the 50 that are included in the signed contracts. \u201cWe are very pleased with the performance of the aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\nEven before the delivery of the test aircraft the IAF has equipped the first F-35\u2019s with Israeli-developed systems.\n\nSources told Breaking Defense that the rapidly changing situation in the Middle East, especially the Iranian effort to gain more influence in countries like Syria and Lebanon, makes buying F-35\u2019s more urgent. The sources added that the decrease in the price of the F-35 will be a one of the main factors in the expected decision.\n\nAccording to sources close to the issue, while the F-35 can perform best when its stealth feature is essential \u2014 in later phases of combat \u2014 the IAF believes the need is for other aircraft, ones with advanced avionics that can operate in conjunction with the F-35 and carry heavy loads of weapons.\n\nRetired Brig. Gen. Assaf Agmon, who served in the IAF as a fighter pilot and in senior command position and then headed the Fisher Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies told Breaking Defense that it will be a mistake to delay the acquisition of an additional F-35 squadron.\u201dThe F-35 is not just another aircraft, it brings a total revolution in the interoperability of air, ground and sea sensors \u201d\n\nHe added that even the Americans have not yet learned the full operational capabilities of the F-35 \u201cand what they do know they not always share with us. So we have to learn by ourselves and this is being done everyday\u201d\n\nHe said that it will be a mistake to invest in another platform based on its capability to carry heavy loads of weapons systems: \u201cThe Israeli defense forces have enough ways to use massive fire power against faraway targets\u201d.\n\nAnother retired IAF brigadier general, who asked not to be identified, said that he was against the acquisition of the F-35 from the outset: \u201cThis is a very expensive aircraft that will not really change the capability of the IAF in the coming 20 years.\u201d With the current Israeli defense budget there is no way to create a critical mass buying F-35s. \u201cThis is a niche system that cannot serve as a game changer. The combat now is based on standoff weapon systems, which makes the presence of an aircraft like the F-35 in the fighting area less important,\u201d the retired general said.\n\nThe contrasting views of the two former high ranking IAF officers symbolize the debate within the IAF. The crucial factor may be the senior leadership of the Israeli Defense Forces and Israel\u2019s intelligence community. The scales tip to the opposite direction whenever the intelligence guys present the most imminent threats, and these changes ARE frequent in the unstable Middle East.\n\nIf the IAF decides to purchase additional F-15s, the deal is likely to occur in the middle of the 10 years U.S defense package that was recently approved by Washington. The new package, in effect from 2019, is for $38 billion over 10 years, up from the $31 billion over the last decade.\n\nThe IAF command wants to keep a \u201ccritical mass \u201d of fighter aircraft that can carry a variety of heavy load weapon systems, including some that are being currently developed by the Israeli defense industries .\n\nThe IAF\u2019s F-15D Baz are central to Israeli air power. They operate a number of missions including air superiority, strike, reconnaissance, and command and control and networking \u201cstations\u201d.\n\nIn the meantime, the IAF is continuing to open the envelope of F-35. And the IAF is adding capabilities to the already operational Adir stealth fighters. This even before the delivery of the dedicated test F-35 that will be delivered in 2019.\n\nThe Israeli F-35A, known as the F-35I Adir, recently took part in the attacks on Syrian ground-air systems that followed the downing of an Israeli F-16 by a Syrian ground -air SA-5 missile.\n\nThe IAF refused to be specific but said that the stealth fighter\u2019s capabilities are a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\nIn mid-March, several IAF sources described the F-35 as a \u201csuper intelligence collector\u201d in stealth mode and with the capability to disperse the data to forces in the air and on the ground.\n\nIAF Commander Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin has decided to classify all F-35 operations so as not to give away data an enemy could use to decrease the stealth fighter\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe IAF\u2019s Golden Eagle squadron is currently operating nine F-35\u2019s; this year another six will be delivered."

    "text": "The US State Department has approved the possible sale of 12 A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, along with weapons, spares and training, to Nigeria in a contract that could be worth $593 million.\n\nThe US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on 3 August announced that the possible Foreign Military Sale had been approved and Congress had been notified on 2 August.\n\nThe prime contractor is the Sierra Nevada Corporation, headquartered in Centennial, Colorado. The company is building Super Tucanos for the Afghan Air Force and Lebanon at its US facility.\n\n\u201cThese aircraft will support Nigerian military operations against terrorist organizations Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa, and Nigerian efforts to counter illicit trafficking in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d the DSCA said. \u201cThe Super Tucano is a sustainable platform for counterterrorism, counter-insurgency, border surveillance, and illicit trade interdiction operations.\u201d\n\nThe DSCA went on to say in a notification that Nigeria is an important partner in the US national security goal to defeat ISIS, including its branches in Africa, and this sale is part of the US commitment to help Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin countries in that fight. \u201cThe proposed sale, and associated training and engagement, is one piece of broader U.S. security cooperation to help professionalize, modernize, and build the capacity of Nigeria\u2019s armed forces and strengthen the US security relationship with Africa\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d\n\nForeign Military Sale to the Government of Nigeria of twelve (12) A-29 Super Tucano aircraft and weapons, including all associated training, spare parts, aviation and ground support equipment, and hangar, facilities, and infrastructure required to support the program. The estimated total case value is $593 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale on August 2, 2017.\n\nThe potential sale will include logistics support, training, spares, ground support equipment and infrastructure. This will include special training on the law of armed conflict and human rights, and air-to-ground integration to minimize civilian harm in air operations.\n\nNigeria has been seeking Super Tucanos since 2015, but concerns by the Obama administration about Nigeria\u2019s human rights record put the deal on hold. When Donald Trump came into office the deal started moving forward, but, according to Defense News, the sale may encounter turbulence.\n\nIn June, US Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rand Paul, R-Ky., sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying, \u201cWe are concerned that the decision to proceed with this sale will empower the government to backtrack even further on its commitments to human rights, accountability, and upholding international humanitarian law, which in turn could spur greater unrest and violence, particularly in the northeastern part of the country.\u201d\n\nUS Congress may block the sale \u2013 a Congressman earlier this year put on hold a proposed sale to Kenya of armed Air Tractor aircraft due to alleged anti-competitive behaviour by its manufacturers.\n\nEmbraer has recorded a number of orders for its Super Tucano from African countries, which see it as a low cost light attack aircraft that can also be used as a trainer. On the continent, the Super Tucano has been ordered by Angola, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Senegal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force may also get second hand Super Tucanos \u2013 in February the Nigerian Air Force announced that Brazilian government had approved the sale of three second hand Super Tucano aircraft to Nigeria."

    "text": "Inside Sweden's plan to mobilize against Russia If you're a NATO member and you're attacked, other members will come to your aid. For nonmember Sweden, this doesn't apply, and so it has plans to mobilize the entire country if attacked by Russia.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 The Swedish military can expect to see a sizable increase in its annual budget regardless of the composition of the new government that will be formed in the wake of parliamentary elections.\n\nAll of the mainstream parties, including the ruling Social Democrats (SDP), the Moderates, the Center, Liberals and the Sweden Democrats\u2019 right-wing nationalist party, campaigned on delivering a stronger national defense and channeling a much higher level of spending to the Swedish Armed Forces over the next 10 years.\n\n\"Sweden needs a more resilient national defense capability that is better funded and resourced,\" said Stefan L\u00f6fven, the SDP\u2019s leader and Sweden\u2019s prime minister.\n\nThe SDP is hoping to assemble a new government in partnership with the Leftist and Green parties. These three parties secured a 40.8 percent share of the popular vote in the recently concluded September 2018 election.\n\nL\u00f6fven\u2019s main challenge is the center-right Alliance group, which includes the Moderates, the Center, Liberals and Christian Democrats. Together, the four Alliance parties won 40.3 percent of the popular vote.\n\nFortress Sweden: Inside the plan to mobilize Swedish society against Russia Sweden is preparing to turn its entire country against an invading force \u2014 and to hold out for three months until help arrives.\n\nThe Alliance is looking to form a new government that excludes both the SDP and the Sweden Democrats.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats raised its share of the popular vote to 17.6 percent. All mainstream parties have ruled out forming a coalition that includes the Sweden Democrats.\n\nDefense will be very much on the minds of Sweden\u2019s new government, against a backdrop of an unpredictable Russia and a domestic military that is unable to either fund major new procurement programs or work within the tight parameters of the current budgeting framework.\n\n\u201cSweden\u2019s national defense has been neglected for decades. What has happened is shameful. The budget allocated to the armed forces must reflect needs, operational realities and the requirement to replace outdated equipment. The goal should be to raise spending on defense to 2 percent of GDP, the recommended NATO level, inside 10 years,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderates and someone being widely tipped to become Sweden\u2019s next prime minister.\n\nThe Alliance supports a more ambitious spending plan for the military that would increase the armed forces' budget by $2.3 billion in the 2019-2021 budgetary period.\n\n\u201cThe [Swedish Armed Forces] needs to be able to afford to run essential equipment-replacement programs. We need more Army brigades, more fighter aircraft, and among other things an increased cyber defense capacity,\u201d Kristersson said.\n\nRestoring the military\u2019s budget and finances to levels that actually reflect the force\u2019s capability requirements will take time. The organization\u2019s budget has been in decline since the Cold War era of 1963, when defense spending amounted to 3.68 percent of Sweden\u2019s gross domestic product. Spending as a ratio of GDP had dropped to 1.1 percent by 2015. It currently stands at about 1.03 percent, a historic low.\n\nInterview: Swedish defense minister details stance on nuclear weapons treaties Sweden is looking to boost its defense posture to deal with Russia's aggressive actions in the region.\n\nA force development plan endorsed by the armed forces favors an increase in annual spending on defense to between $7.36 billion and $9 billion by 2025.\n\nIn the longer term, and by the year 2035, the military would like to see defense spending rise to more than $12.1 billion. At the same time, the Swedish Armed Forces would be strengthened from the current 50,000 personnel of all ranks to 120,000 by the year 2035.\n\nThis proposed new look, improved capability and reinforced organization would comprise at least four brigade-level units, a light infantry special forces regiment, a fleet of 24 surface combat naval vessels and six submarines, eight fighter squadrons, and 120 Gripen combat aircraft.\n\nStefan L\u00f6fven\u2019s SDP-led government adopted new measures in 2017 to increase annual spending on the military from about $4.7 billion to $6.6 billion by 2019.\n\nUnder the spending plan supported by the Alliance, defense expenditure would grow year on year after 2019, reaching $8 billion by 2024.\n\nThe Swedish Armed Forces\u2019 commander in chief, Gen. Micael Byd\u00e9n, has warned the government and the national parliament\u2019s Committee on Defence that the military will be forced to implement \u201cfar-reaching\u201d cost-saving measures if the military fails to secure a substantial increase in its budget after 2019.\n\n\u201cThe government has been updated regarding the true state of our capabilities and finances. We will need to engage in additional and wide-ranging cost savings if there is no real improvement in spending going forward,\u201d Byd\u00e9n said.\n\nAreas provisionally targeted for cost-saving and resource cutbacks by the Swedish Armed Forces include system procurement programs and the Army\u2019s training and exercise operations. Belt-tightening would also likely place greater constraints on the regularity of Air Force flight missions and the Navy\u2019s littoral patrol and ocean water defense activities.\n\nSweden\u2019s purchase of the Raytheon-made Patriot air and missile defense system from the U.S. government emerged as one program that could be negatively impacted by a lack of defense spending.\n\nEstonia eyes mid-range air defense systems to rectify NATO \u2018oversight\u2019 The Baltic region faces a challenge on how to defend its airspace from Russian incursion.\n\nSwedish interest in the Patriot increased after the defense missile system was deployed during the military\u2019s Aurora 17 exercises, held in and around the Swedish Baltic island of Gotland in September 2017.\n\nThe Patriot system, including missile units, will cost Sweden an estimated $1.2 billion. In August, Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told a meeting of the national parliament\u2019s Committee on Defence that Sweden plans to purchase an undisclosed number of missiles at an estimated unit cost of about $5 million.\n\n\u201cThe purchase of the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system is important given the difficult security situation in Sweden\u2019s neighborhood. Rapid technological developments mean that Sweden faces a mix of threats,\u201d said Joakim Lewin, the head of the FMV\u2019s Army Design Office. The FMV is responsible for materiel sourcing and managing military procurement."

    "text": "Western governments and arms companies have contributed to the Egyptian military\u2019s consolidation of political power, a new report said.\n\nTitled The Officers\u2019 Republic, the report was published by Transparency International Defence & Security on Friday a week before Egyptians take to the polls in an election that is expected to see the president and military general, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, secure another four-year term.\n\nThe report said Western defence companies \u2013 with approval from their governments \u2013 continue to provide Egypt\u2019s military with aid and security support without any form of \u201cmeaningful transparency\u201d.\n\nJames Lynch, deputy director of the UK-based organisation, said countries are assisting a military that has not only taken full political control of Egypt \u2013 albeit with little to no scrutiny \u2013 but one that is also struggling with local and regional instability.\n\n\u201cWestern states, who could do much to influence this situation, are meanwhile failing to demand serious reform and instead carrying on with business as usual, while mistakenly still considering Egypt a trusted partner for security in stability in the region,\u201d said Lynch.\n\n\u2018Unaccountable institution\u2019\n\nSince former president Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down in 2011, Egypt\u2019s military has gone from one political strength to another, and has expanded its economic goals. Yet, the report said, the military has remained a \u201clargely opaque and unaccountable institution\u201d.\n\nThe average defence budget is estimated to be about $4.4bn, but little is known about where that gets earmarked as it is treated as a state secret.\n\nDuring the past five years, Egypt has become the third largest arms importer in the world, but Lynch said there is little to show in terms of protecting the safety and security of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Egyptian people have a military that does everything but keep the country secure,\u201d he said. \u201cIts concern with building its economic and political power has hugely frustrated its efforts to deal with the security challenges it faces in the Sinai and other places.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, several human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have accused members of the Egyptian military of extrajudicial executions in the Sinai, showing \u201cthey fear no oversight or accountability for their actions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a military that may very well be the architect of its own security crisis,\u201d Lynch said.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nTransparency in the face of opacity\n\nAs human rights abuses and state violence in Egypt continue to increase, the report made a series of recommendations for the international community to counter the opacity of the Egyptian military.\n\nIt called for making financial and security assistance dependant on achieving basic levels of transparency and accountability, and to amplify domestic voices advocating for that.\n\nIt also urged better domestic oversight of the armed forces by asking tougher questions on the military\u2019s economic activities.\n\n\u201cThe international community must understand that not only is it doing a major disservice to the people of Egypt by providing support to the armed forces with few strings attached,\u201d Lynch said, \u201cit is also contributing to the security crisis in the country and region.\u201d"

    "text": "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is moving forward with plans to make it easier to sell small arms abroad.\n\nThe State department has submitted a request to shift oversight on small-arms exports, such as semiautomatic rifles, from State to Commerce, kicking off a 45-day review period of the new policy, which has been long sought by the gun industry.\n\nThe move impacts any firearms that are \u201cwidely available\u201d in U.S. stores for commercial sale. However, State would maintain oversight on any weapons sold primarily for military use.\n\nIt\u2019s a move that arms manufacturers have sought for years, with hopes of selling more weapons abroad \u2013 one that aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s stance that economic security and national security are irrevocably linked.\n\nDo new Trump arms export rules live up to the hype? The Trump administration has a new conventional arms export policy, but it is unclear what has actually changed.\n\nBut while the Trump administration is pushing forward the policy, discussion about moving such weapons to Commerce has been underway for years as part of the Obama administration\u2019s export reform efforts. Under that umbrella, the State department went through the various categories of export rules and looked to move as much as possible over to Commerce, in order to encourage exports and free up State regulators to spend more time on large defense items.\n\n\u201cThese changes will significantly reduce the regulatory burden on the U.S. commercial firearms and ammunition industry, promote American exports, and clarify the regulatory requirements for independent gunsmiths, while at the same time prioritizing national security controls and continuing our ability to restrict exports where human rights, illicit trafficking, and related issues may be of concern,\u201d a State department spokesman told Defense News on background.\n\nDuring the 45-day comment period, arms control groups are expected to object over fears such weapons may be used against civilian populations. While State continues to have oversight on military-grade weapons, sales of semiautomatic weapons for police forces would now be outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

In a May 15 statement, he warned that \u201cweakened Congressional oversight of international small arms and munitions sales is extremely hazardous to global security.\u201d"

    "text": "The recent standoff between Ukraine and Russia in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov has put the often-ignored Russian coast guard into the...\n\nThe recent standoff between Ukraine and Russia in the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov has put the often-ignored Russian coast guard into the spotlight. Expletive-laden videos in Russian show a coast guard cutter ramming a Ukrainian tug, probably incurring damage in the process.\n\nThe Russian coast guard is an element of the border guard. In an administrative reorganization in 2003, the previously independent border guard was swallowed by the FSB. The FSB succeeded the KGB as a crucial element in internal intelligence, security and control for the Russian state.\n\nHowever, the border guard has a long and illustrious history in Russia, where Border Guard Day is celebrated on May 28. The Russian coast guard is therefore both a law enforcement and a quasi-intelligence organization, although its roots and identity are in maritime law enforcement. The Kerch incident perhaps is a significant gatepost marking the evolution of the Coast Guard after 15 years of control by the FSB.\n\nThe level of working integration between the coast guard and the FSB structure above it remains uncertain, although the Kerch incident suggests a high level of control. In addition, air support for this operation likely came from military units, demonstrating further operational coordination between FSB and the military.\n\nThese aspects of the Kerch incident are interesting for both the potential future uses of the Russian Coast Guard for aggressive gray zone operations, and for questions about the United States and NATO countries\u2019 engagements with the Russian coast guard.\n\nThe Kerch Strait operation reflects a new use of the Russian coast guard, more akin to Chinese or Iranian use of paramilitary and constabulary maritime forces and \u201clawfare.\u201d As recently described by my colleague Conor Kennedy, China has been using its coast guard and maritime militia with great effectiveness to assert presence, conduct harassment and sabotage, escort and provide a pretext for defensive military action, and gather intelligence.\n\nWhile harassment of U.S. Navy warships by Iranian small boats that are military lies firmly within mil-mil guidelines, using constabulary forces changes the dynamics of the use of force. Similar to Chinese use of nonmilitary coast guard and maritime militia to accomplish strategic objectives while maintaining \u201cplausible deniability\u201d and avoiding escalatory dynamics, Moscow may have deliberately chosen to use the Russian Coast Guard to act in the Kerch Strait.\n\nThe use of the Russian Federation Navy to close the strait would have been more likely to escalate because it would have been a military-on-military clash. In contrast, using the Russian coast guard made it a law enforcement issue rather than a military-sanctioned act of war. Russia is adept at using legal channels to pursue violations of justice. It now appears willing to use its coast guard for this purpose.\n\nOnshore, the situation in eastern Ukraine has been stuck in a rut. Perhaps the escalation in the Sea of Azov was seen by the Russians as a means to break the impasse, using the flimsy legal cover provided by the coast guard. No similar terrestrial options exist, as the Russians have exhausted their plausible deniability for operations by police, volunteers and undercover \u201clittle green men.\u201d\n\nWhile Russian seizure of the Azov coast was anticipated, it was not expected to use its coast guard. Utilizing the Russian coast guard in this way opens a new range of options for Moscow, in the Sea of Azov and beyond.\n\nAbove \u2014 the Russian coast guard Project 97P vessel Volga. Photo via Wikipedia. At top \u2014 a Russian tug rams a Ukrainian navy boat as a Russian coast guard vessel stands by on Nov. 25, 2018. Ukrainian ministry of defense photo\n\nAbove \u2014 the Russian coast guard Project 97P vessel. Photo via Wikipedia. At top \u2014 a Russian tug rams a Ukrainian navy boat as a Russian coast guard vessel stands by on Nov. 25, 2018. Ukrainian ministry of defense photo\n\nAdditional motivation to launch a coast guard operation, rather than using Russian navy ships, may come from the recent accident involving Russia\u2019s PD-50 floating dry dock in Severodvinsk. The carry-on effects of losing that dry dock must be rippling through operational plans for the Black Sea Fleet. If the PD-50 accident is hastening the \u201cgreen water\u201d evolution of the Russian navy, a growing role and closer coordination with the coast guard is a logical step.\n\nBringing the Russian coast guard into play may provide additional operational flexibility depth, in addition to range.\n\nAs it has tested different tactics in Syria and Ukraine, Russia could be evaluating the use of the Russian coast guard for action elsewhere. Where else might Russia deploy its coast guard in aggressive ways? On conceivable option would be against Norway in Svalbard, a demilitarized island group under Norwegian sovereignty adjacent to important Barents Sea fisheries.\n\nWith a substantial Russian population on Svalbard, there has been increasing speculation that Russia may launch gray zone operations there. However, the Norwegian and Russian navies and coast guards have a fairly effective working relationship and Russia could be far less confident in the outcome.\n\nDespite the loss of a frigate, Norway\u2019s confidence and modern naval and air capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis Russia are far beyond Ukraine\u2019s. Moreover, the strategic calculus for Moscow in Svalbard is far riskier.\n\nCoast guards are one of the last remaining effective areas of cooperation among NATO countries and Russia. The coast guards of the United States, Canada and Norway all engage with their Russian counterparts on soft security issues including fisheries enforcement, oil spill response and search and rescue operations.\n\nBilaterally, U.S. and Russian coast guards cooperate on fisheries enforcement in the Bering Sea and North Pacific across the shared maritime border. Therefore the Kerch incident will pose a challenging question about further cooperation between coast guards. One avenue of response may be to limit engagement by NATO countries\u2019 coast guards with the Russian coast guard.\n\nMoscow\u2019s bold new deployment of the Russian coast guard this week puts further pressure on the strategy of isolation the United States and its allies are pursuing against Russia. It is also a troubling sign of future directions for Russian unconventional operations, and an indication of closer ties between the RCG and Russian Federation Navy.\n\nThe recordings released by the Ukrainian General Staff, which in fact might be intercepted Russian coast guard communications, include comments that Adm. Gennady Medvedev, head of the border guard, is \u201cpanicking\u201d and \u201cthe president is in control of all that.\u201d Medvedev may be apprehensive about his suddenly expanding role in the Russian constellation of aggression.\n\nThe views presented here are the author\u2019s own, and do not represent the views of the U.S. Navy or the U.S. Naval War College, where the author is an instructor."

Nkaissery hailed the delivery of the helicopter as a boost to the Police Air Wing, which now has three operational Mi-17 rotorcraft.\n\nHe said with the new aircraft, the air wing would be able to conduct counter-terrorism operations and respond to other policing needs in remote parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe capacity and ability of the Police Air Wing has tremendously improved in the last four years under the National Police Service modernisation programme, of which the helicopter acquisition project is part.\n\n\u201cToday we launched a long-range helicopter with the capacity to carry 36 fully-equipped security officers and an airborne endurance of up to about four hours depending on various factors including the weather,\u201d Nkaissery said.\n\nShcherbinin said by opting for the Mi-17V-5, Kenya had joined a growing African customer base which now operates more than 700 products of the Russian Helicopters conglomerate.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully fulfilled the contract to supply our first helicopter to Kenya. Currently, the total fleet of Russian-made helicopters in the African countries exceeds 700, and it requires a gradual upgrade.\n\n\u201cRussian helicopters have shown good results in performing the widest range of tasks in Africa. We hope for further and fruitful cooperation,\u201d he said. In terms of the contract, the company has also started training some local aircraft assembly and maintenance specialists.\n\nThe company is expected to deliver another Mi-17V-5 helicopter to the Kenyan police service before the end of April. At least five helicopter pilots have been trained to operate the helicopters.\n\nAccording to Russian Helicopters, the Mi-8/17 type helicopters offered to African clients are intended primarily for use in civil aviation, to transport cargo and passengers including VIPs.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two Klimov VK-2500PS-03 turboshaft engines of 2,400 hp each giving a cruising speed of 260 km/h, a maximum speed of 280 km/h and a range of 800 km. It has a service ceiling of 6 000 m.\n\nThe Kenya Police Air Wing lost an AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter in a crash in September 2016. It was damaged beyond repair and written off after the accident. The delivery of the Mi-17 partially offsets this, and other helicopter losses by the Air wing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kenyan National Police Service has also taken delivery of 43 Toyota Landcruiser 4X4 patrol vehicles in single-cab configuration. The vehicles were donated by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and they will be used for policing operations in and around the Dadab and Kakuma refugee camps.\n\nThe Dadab camp, which is home to thousands of war-refugees from neighbouring Somalia, is set to be closed by the Kenyan government which claims to have intelligence reports indicating that it was a breeding ground for some of the militants who were involved in terrorist acts in the last few years.\n\nThe vehicles were handed over to Kenyan Police Inspector-General Joseph Boinnet by UNHCR country representative Raouf Mazou in Nairobi on 28 March.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoinnet said with the vehicles as a force multiplier, police would work to ensure the security of the refugee camps. Some of the vehicles will be deployed to counter-terrorism operations in the north-east of the country."

The new missile will reportedly incorporate advanced Japanese radar technology into the ramjet-powered, beyond-visual-range Meteor missile currently under development by European defense contractor MBDA.\n\nWhat makes the Meteor missile attractive to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense is that it can be fitted into the F-35\u2019s internal weapons bay. (Japan is currently in the process of inducting 42 F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters into service.) It is the first time that Japan is partnering with a country other than the U.S. on a joint defense technology project.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, Japan and the United Kingdom are conducting joint research on the feasibility of a new air-to-air missile before starting research on a future middle-range air to air missile,\u201d Onodera said. \u201cThe research planned for fiscal 2018 is (\u2026) intended to (\u2026) realize a middle-range air to air missile with (..) increased speed and (\u2026) extended range (\u2026) [small enough] to be integrated into fighter aircraft,\u201d the minister said.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe intention is to combine the active electronically scanned array seeker of the Mitsubishi Electric AAM-4B medium-range air-to-air missile with the Meteor as the AAM-4B is too bulky to fit into the F-35 A\u2019s internal weapons bay.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Japan aims to establish a small, high-performance seeker technology adapted to future threats, and to that end, we will examine the performance of an actual model based on the combination of Japanese technology and the United Kingdom\u2019s long-range propulsion technology,\u201d Onodera added.\n\nLive fire testing of the new missile is expected to begin in 2018 with a possible deployment date set for the late 2020s.\n\nIn March of this year, Japan and the UK also agreed to explore options for co-developing an advanced fighter jet. \u201cThe agreement stipulates that both countries will exchange information about advanced aviation technology and also conduct a joint study on the feasibility of co-developing a new fighter aircraft in the coming years,\u201d I explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore in 2016, the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) conducted their first-ever joint aerial combat drill, dubbed Guardian North 16, in Japan. The exercise involved four RAF Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, as well as a number of JASDF Boeing F-15J all-weather air superiority fighters and Mitsubishi F-2s."

(Long-term plans call for at least 18 multi-role helicopters to replace Soviet-designed Mi-17 rotorcraft, though no platform has been selected as yet.)\n\n\u201cBy replacing them, we are also cutting those ties with Russia,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, adding that Slovakia will fly the UH-60 and Mi-17 for several years while the UH-60 is phased in.\n\nSlovakia was a part of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War but joined the European Union and the NATO military alliance in 2004.\n\nSlovakian officials understand the purchase of American hardware strengthens their strategic relationship, but Ondrejcs\u00e1k emphasized \u2014 on the anniversary of Czechoslovakia\u2019s velvet revolution in 1989 \u2014 the partnership is based on faith in liberal democratic values.\n\n\u201cWe want to see America as a leader in the free world, as they did for 70 years,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said. \u201cWe hear a lot here [at Halifax] about the values-based international order, but it\u2019s very real for us.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nNATO member Slovakia is on track to purchase 14 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighters to replace its MiG-29 jets, part of a wider effort to break from Russia, Slovak Ministry of Defense State Secretary R\u00f3bert Ondrejcs\u00e1k said on the sidelines of the 2018 Halifax International Security Forum.\n\nBeyond the U.S., leaders of Slovakia and the Czech Republic announced in September the two countries will cooperate on joint purchases of weapons and military equipment. Both have moved to increase their respective defense budgets following Russia\u2019s alleged military intervention in Ukraine\u2019s eastern part and its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.\n\nAs to the F-16s, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said the intent is for his government to finalize the legislative vehicle and contract in the coming months to ensure timely delivery of the first F-16s in 2022 or 2023.\n\nIn part driven by maintenance costs, Slovakia decided to make a switch from the MiG-29 and ultimately chose the F-16V over the Saab Gripen based on price and internal analysis, according to Ondrejcs\u00e1k.\n\nThe announcement came in July after U.S. State Department in April approved the potential sale of 14 Block 70/72 F-16Vs for Slovakia.\n\nOtherwise, negotiations are also underway for the U.S. to further improve Slovakian air fields in Slia\u010d, which is in central Slovakia and in Malacky, which is in in Western Slovakia.\n\n\u201cWe take it as a win-win situation because they are investing in infrastructure, which will be crucial for us too,\u201d Ondrejcs\u00e1k said of the U.S. military. \u201cOf course its good for them (the U.S. military) because in case of potential operations, they (the airfields) are available.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has ramped up investments that would enable it to deploy to allied bases in Eastern Europe and operate close to Russia\u2019s western flank. U.S. air field improvements have already included partner air bases in Hungary, Estonia and elsewhere.\n\nAs Slovakia upgrades its heavy mechanized units, it is also exploring the modernization of its existing fleet of T-72 main battle tanks, Ondrejcs\u00e1k said, rather than wait for the next generation of MBT to be developed. No platform has been selected."

    "text": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 More than two decades after the program was officially launched, Turkey has signed a contract for the serial production of the country\u2019s first indigenous, new-generation main battle tank, the Altay.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar contract was signed Nov. 9 between Turkey\u2019s defense procurement authority, the Defence Industry Executive of the Presidency (or SSB, formerly SSM) and Turkish-Qatari armored vehicles manufacturer BMC, which has close links to Turkey\u2019s ruling party. Officials did not reveal the contract price.\n\nThe contract involves the production of an initial batch of 250 units, life cycle logistical support, and the establishment by the contractor of a tank systems technology center and its operation. As part of the contract, BMC will also design, develop and produce a tank with an unmanned fire control unit.\n\nThe first Altay tank will roll off the assembly line within 18 months, according to the contract.\n\nAccording to Ahmet Raci Yal\u00e7\u0131n, head of the land vehicles department at SSB, the Altay program will materialize in two phases: T1 and T2. T1 covers the first 250 units, he said, and the T2 phase will involve the advanced version of the Altay.\n\nIsmail Demir, the head of SSB, said: \u201cThis contract is the joint work of the parties (SSB and BMC) for the optimal production of a cost-efficient tank.\u201d He added that the Turkish government has not ruled out partnerships, cooperation and support with and from foreign entities.\n\nAfter Turkey\u2019s election, is it (defense) business as usual? Turkey's president is widely known for his ambitions in indigenous defense and aerospace capabilities in line with his efforts to increase Turkey\u2019s regional and global political clout.\n\nHe also noted that the government expects BMC to deliver unmanned armored vehicles solutions.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nDespite plans for the Altay to be the \u201cbest tank in the world\u201d (in the words of BMC Chairman Ethem Sancak), industry sources and experts are questioning the program\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cNo one knows if, as originally planned, the Altay would be powered by a German-made engine (from MTU) and a German-made transmission mechanism,\u201d one source said. \u201cThere are big questions marks about the armor and the active protection system. \u2026 And of course, if the Altay will feature German know-how, will it be on the market with German export licenses, or restricted for sales abroad, or even deployed for certain sensitive missions like in Syria or Iraq?\u201d\n\nDemir, however, is confident Turkey \u201cwill not allow any restrictions\u201d in regard to indigenous programs with foreign know-how, including the engine. In other words: BMC will use foreign engines in the first Altay tanks due to \u201ctime limitations,\u201d but ultimately Turkey wants to maximize locally made parts for its indigenous programs.\n\nIn terms of where this foreign technology will come from, A London-based defense expert noted that a potential German blockade could mean \u201cBMC will not have too many options and may have to go non-NATO, like Russia or Ukraine.\u201d Such a move would be the second major defense contract that Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 would sign with a non-NATO country, after the government\u2019s decision to acquire and deploy the Russian-made S-400 air and anti-missile defense system.\n\nSecurity experts say Turkey\u2019s regional rivals, as well as state and nonstate entities Turkey views as security threats, are closely watching the Altay\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cThe future pace of the Altay program and potential technological and financial snags it may face will be watched closely by Greece, Syria, Iraq and, to a lesser degree, by Russia,\u201d said Ahmet Do\u011fan, vice president of the Ankara-based think tank Sigma.\n\nCurrency crisis risks Turkish defense programs Turkey\u2019s defense and procurement planners are worried the plunge of the national currency could expose foreign currency-related weapons programs to the risk of major delays or suspension.\n\nIn April, the procurement authority SSB, then SSM, announced that it selected BMC as the winner of the Altay contract. BMC defeated Otokar, an armored vehicles producer that built the Altay\u2019s prototype, and FNSS, another privately owned armored vehicles maker.\n\nIn 2008, Otokar, Turkey\u2019s largest privately owned defense company, signed a $500 million contract with SSM for the development and production of four prototypes of the Altay. The prototype contract did not involve serial production.\n\nBMC is a partnership between a Qatari investment fund and a Turkish venture, whose partner, Sancak, also sat on the executive board of Turkey\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party."

    "text": "Soldiers of the Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army on the central square in Stepanakert, capital of the self-declared republic, May 2017. Photo CC BY 2.0: David Stanley / Flickr. Some rights reserved.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Open Caucasus Media. We are grateful for their permission to republish it here.\n\nFor three decades the border between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan has echoed with the crack of gunfire: the ceaseless noise of the oldest \u2018frozen conflict\u2019 in the former USSR. Yet for those living in Nagorno-Karabakh since the ceasefire of 1994 was signed, this border has seemed to drift further and further away, almost vanishing from the horizon of relevance.\n\nGegham Baghdasaryan, the head of the Karabakh Press Club, illustrated this in an anecdote: at an international conference years ago, a young Armenian woman from Karabakh was called to the floor. She was asked about the relationship between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan. She replied, \u201cwhat is my relationship to Azerbaijan? I don\u2019t have a relationship. I just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\nThis opinion was far from unique, and was echoed by many in Karabakh. One respondent, a young man in his mid-twenties, said that the events of April \u201copened his eyes\u201d to the \u201creal danger\u201d that Azerbaijan presented. For him and for other young people, the ceasefire had been all they had ever known, and for all the bellicose rhetoric and the slow but constant deaths on the border, it had become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky.\n\nThe ceasefire is all Karabakh\u2019s youth have ever known. Bellicose rhetoric and deaths on the border have become background noise, as fixed and permanent as the hills and sky\n\nSince the clashes of April 2016 \u2014 four days during which fierce fighting erupted along the line of contact, and ended with over a hundred fatalities, and the seizure by Azerbaijan of several key positions formerly controlled by Armenian forces \u2014 the conflict has taken on a shrill immediacy. The shock which initially gripped the population of Karabakh transformed into anger both at Azerbaijan and at the loss of a sense of normality.\n\nA few years ago, flare-ups in the prolonged conflict might have been seen both by residents and politicians as exceptional, but this most recent violent eruption seems to have solidified in their minds a sense that rather than an exception, war is in fact, the normal state of affairs, and that military interests must circumscribe and submerge all other pursuits.\n\nThe Karabakh war lasted from 1988\u20131994. It claimed over 30,000 lives, displaced almost a million people, and utterly devastated Karabakh\u2019s economy and infrastructure. The region suffered an estimated $5 billion in damage (with a population of only 140,000) \u2014 further compounded by the deindustrialisation that followed the USSR\u2019s collapse.\n\nNevertheless, Nagorno-Karabakh endured. With generous aid from the Republic of Armenia as well as donations from the global Armenian diaspora, Nagorno-Karabakh was rebuilt. By 2007 it had the fastest growing economy in the wider region, with GDP growth rates fluctuating between 10%\u201315% per year. Moreover, unlike Armenia, it did not suffer from demographic decline, with the population increasing by 10% since 2005.\n\nThis quite literal \u201crise from the ashes\u201d is most apparent in Karabakh\u2019s capital, Stepanakert. Formerly a bombed-out city with more than a passing resemblance to post-war Sarajevo, it has in recent years developed into a small yet bustling urban centre, featuring well-paved boulevards, neatly maintained gardens, and a wealth of public amenities.\n\nThe Caucasian tiger\n\n\u2018At first [Karabakh\u2019s economic development] was a patriotic undertaking\u2019, Davit Babayan, speaker for the office of the President of Nagorno-Karabakh, told OC Media. \u2018But that cannot work forever\u2019. He argues that Karabakh\u2019s economic motor for the past decade was a commitment to a \u2018market-driven\u2019 economy, and that only by creating \u2018special conditions for investment\u2019 would Karabakh\u2019s development continue.\n\nOfficially, Nagorno-Karabakh has been on an explicitly market-oriented path since 2007, when under the official direction of its newly elected President Bako Sahayan, it undertook rapid (neo)liberal economic reforms. Examples of this include: the dissolution of the anti-monopoly service (under the slogan \u201cThe Market Will Figure It Out\u201d), the creation of a flat-tax for those categorised as self-employed ($15 a month), and the reduction of regulations on construction licenses (officially it should take only three days for a new license to be approved). The reforms also entailed the privatisation of a series of state-owned assets, most significantly, the regional hydropower utility.\n\nMuch like the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, this \u201cCaucasian Tiger\u201d is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance\n\nConsidered in conjunction with Karabakh\u2019s stellar rates of economic growth, these reforms drew praise from liberal voices in the wider region, with some even calling the region \u201cThe Caucasian Tiger\u201d.\n\nHowever, in a similar vein to the \u201cAsian Tigers\u201d, Karabakh is less of a market miracle than is apparent at first glance. Karabakh\u2019s rapid development has been made possible only through significant government intervention in the market and perhaps more importantly, ongoing transfers of funds from the Republic of Armenia. This state of affairs is only made possible through Karabakh\u2019s unique geopolitical and ideological position.\n\nArmenia\u2019s heart\n\nNagorno-Karabakh is without question the single most volatile factor in Armenia\u2019s politics. It is not simply a place, but an idea. It stands in for Armenian nationhood, and in a country where the Armenian Genocide of 1915 still defines foreign policy, it provides a powerful counter-narrative to a sense of historical victimhood. As Karabakh politician Karen Avagimyan told OC Media, Karabakh is \u201cthe spiritual heart of Armenia\u201d.\n\nA banner in central Stepanakert. Photo (c): Khachig Joukhajian / OC Media. All rights reserved.In practical terms this means that if any significant amount of territory in Karabakh is re-taken by Azerbaijan, the government in Yerevan would likely not survive. For instance, in the summer of 2016 a group of Karabakh veterans calling themselves the Sasna Tsrer (the Daredevils of Sasun) seized a police station and called for an uprising against the government. Central to their criticisms of the government was their claim that the current administration intended to cede part of Karabakh to Azerbaijan. While the claim seems to have been spurious, at the time, it helped to mobilise thousands of young people who met with police in violent clashes in defence of the Sasna Tsrer.\n\nThe policies of the Armenian Government towards Karabakh, and the policies of the Karabakh government itself, must be understood in the light of such events. Karabakh\u2019s territorial integrity must be maintained, and all economic and social policies must account for and support this objective.\n\nIn Karabakh, where economic emigration is seen as a threat to national security, neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option\n\nAs Nagorno-Karabakh is an unrecognised state, it is therefore not party to most international trade-treaties. This means the government needs to maintain an investment friendly atmosphere and to advertise this friendliness, if \u201cnon-patriotic\u201d investment (coming primarily from the Russian Federation) is to continue. However, this creates a certain conundrum for the ruling authorities. Investor-friendly and deregulated markets often foster grave societal inequality, with less competitive local workers and small businesses being crushed by economies of scale. As in much of the world, poverty easily transforms into migration, which while quite tolerable for most governments, in Karabakh is simply a non-starter.\n\nIn the eyes of Karabakh officials, the equation of migration is simple: migration equals a lower population, a lower population means fewer soldiers, and fewer soldiers not only makes Karabakh militarily weaker but also incentivises Azerbaijan to attack. This means that the economy cannot be subject to the whims of a capricious market, as population fluctuation resulting from periodic economic crises would quite literally endanger Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 neoliberalism tout court is not a tenable option.\n\nMilitarised social democracy\n\nIn practice, the collection of policies enacted to ensure economic stability and liveability in Nagorno-Karabakh can be considered a sort of militarised social democracy: welfare mechanisms are in place to lessen the impact of unemployment or poverty, but they differ from traditional European social democracy in that these mechanisms are tied explicitly to military status.\n\nFor instance, a large portion of the population sits on military pensions, and the families of soldiers killed or wounded on the front are not only financially supported, but often granted free housing or other essentials and amenities. The state also insures all residents who live close to the line of contact, with any damage from the conflict (such as homes damaged by shelling or cattle killed by gunfire) covered by the state.\n\nMarket in Stepanakert, 2012. Photo CC BY-NC-ND 2.0: Marco Fieber / Flickr. Some rights reserved.That\u2019s not to say the government doesn\u2019t make use of traditional Keynesian policy either. In fact, the state often intervenes at the level of the firm, providing subsidies and preferential loans to struggling businesses, keeping them afloat to ensure that a higher level of employment is maintained.\n\nIt may seem like this is a little much for a government presiding over a relatively poor population of 146,000 to accomplish, and that\u2019s because it is. The government of Nagorno-Karabakh is far from self-sufficient. Officially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated for the region, though the real number is likely far higher, especially since any budget transfers related to national defence are classified.\n\nOfficially, at least 4.5% of Armenia\u2019s national budget is allocated to Nagorno-Karabakh \u2014 though the real amount is probably much higher\n\nThis policy direction has only solidified since the April clashes. Villages near the line of contact have become subject to new legislative classification as \u201cborder villages\u201d. Here, according to Speaker of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Artak Beglaryan, the government\u2019s explicit purpose is to maintain, and if possible, increase the population in order to create a presence that would detect and deter Azerbaijani attacks. This is a difficult task, as these villages are directly in the line of fire \u2014 an understandable disincentive for citizens to continue living there.\n\nWhich is why under the auspices of this new legislation the government has increased subsidies for these villages \u2014 for instance, creating a gas and electricity subsidy that, for some households, entirely covers their monthly bills \u2014 as well as providing financial incentives (again subsidies, as well as tax breaks) for investment in border villages in order to stimulate employment.\n\nBut the lengths to which the government is willing to leave behind neoliberal economic orthodoxy is most apparent in the village most affected by the conflict: Talish.\n\nA kolkhoz by any other name\n\nIn the dawn hours of 2 April 2016, the north-western heights above the small village of 500 were overrun by the Azerbaijani military. By the time Armenian forces retook Talish, it had been reduced to rubble, and even after the ceasefire was signed, the strategic hills overlooking the village remained in Azerbaijani hands.\n\nWith most of the homes destroyed, the people of Talish have become homeless, living with relatives or in state-provided housing in nearby villages further away from the line of contact. However, even in its current strategically vulnerable position, the Karabakh government is committed to rebuilding Talish, and having its residents return.\n\nArmenian militia in Talish, a village in the Martakert region of the self-declared Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, April 2016. Photo (c): RIA Novosti. All rights reserved.Every single family that lost a home will have their home rebuilt. Infrastructure will be repaired and updated. New buildings will also be added, including a house of culture and a recreation centre. But these are not the most ambitious plans for the village; in order to ensure a high level of employment and a strong degree of social solidarity, the village is rebuilding its agricultural and production capacities in a collective model.\n\nIn the words of Talish Mayor Vilen Petrosyan, \u201cIt will be like a Soviet kolkhoz (collective farm - ed.), but different. Instead of giving our profits to the government, the community will decide what to do with them\u201d. The beginnings of this new/old model are already in place. The Talish \u2018collective\u2019 is producing honey, fruit and vegetables, spirits, meat, and dairy \u2014 with several dozen workers employed by the social enterprise composed of former Talish residents (entirely men) who have returned to the village as government contractors, working to rebuild their homes and defend them in case of an attack.\n\nWhether the model will work, and if it will actually be democratic, remains to be seen. But for the local administration, the hope is that the new Talish will not only flourish, but become a model of economy and governance for other villages in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nGoing nowhere\n\nFrom 1994 onwards, the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh have been holding out hope for a peaceful normalisation of their situation. But as repeated peace deals floundered, and a deep chill descended, many began to adapt to a new status quo. Even if peace never came, life would go on. But the events of April 2016 shattered this uneasy sense of stability.\n\nIn a strange irony however, as the Karabakh people\u2019s sense of stability was shattered, the existing economic and political order only grew stronger. As a region forged in the crucible of conflict and still enduring its ravages almost thirty years later, Nagorno-Karabakh has ceased being a place where the military exists to support state and society. Rather state and society now exist to support the military. And that is unlikely to change any time soon."

A team of NAF officers will visit Brazil to inspect the aircraft ahead of delivery.\n\nNigeria also intends to purchase new Super Tucano aircraft from the United State. Indications are that up to 12 of the light attack and trainer turboprops could be acquired from the United States, via Embraer\u2019s Florida production line that is run in conjunction with Sierra Nevada Corp.\n\nThe US Congress has not yet been formally notified of a possible US approval of the sale of Super Tucanos to Nigeria, but in May last year Reuters reported that the US was seeking to approve the sale.\n\nNigeria has a strong requirement for an aircraft like the Super Tucano as it battles the domestic Boko Haram insurgency and also deploys combat aircraft to foreign countries on peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Super Tucano can be used for training, surveillance or attack. It can be armed with two wing-mounted machine guns and can carry up to 1 550 kg of weapons."

If the aircraft you're searching for is not in this list, use the 'Keywords' field further down in the search menus. Some menu selections include a generic aircraft model, as well as more specific variants of that airliner. These variants are denoted by a - before the aircraft name. Selecting 'Boeing 747,' for example, will show results featuring all Boeing 747 jetliners in our database, while selecting '- Boeing 747-200' will show all Boeing 747-200 variants in our database (Boeing 747-200, Boeing 747-212B, Boeing 747-283F, etc.)\n\nIf you are looking for photos of a specific airline, use this menu. Please note that, due to space constraints, this menu includes only airlines of which 10 or more photos exist in our database. If the airline you're searching for is not in this list, use the 'Keywords' field further down in the search menu. Airlines are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nIf you are looking for photos taken in a specific country, or at a specific airport, use this menu. All countries represented in our database are included in this selection menu, which is updated automatically as the database grows. There must be at least 20 photos from a specific airport in the database before that airport is added to this list.\n\nUse this option to include only photos taken by a specific photographer in your search. This pulldown menu, in addition to each photographer available as a search limiter, also shows the number of photos currently in the database for each specific photographer, enclosed in brackets. For example, an option of:\n\n- Paul Jones [550]\n\n.. indicates that there are 550 total photos taken by Paul Jones currently in the database. Note: The total number of photos, enclosed in brackets, is updated four (4) times hourly, and may be slightly inaccurate. Photographers must have 100 or more photos in the database before their name is included in this selection menu..\n\nThe 'All Photographers' selection is the default selection for this option.\n\nIf you are looking for a specific category of photo, use this menu. You may select to display only photos from certain categories, such as Special Paintschemes, Flight Deck photos, etc. New categories are constantly being added to this list.\n\nThe 'Keywords' field is perhaps the most useful field included in our search engine.\n\nUsing this field, you may search for any word, term, or combinations of terms in our database.\n\nEvery photo field is covered by the Keywords search routine. The Keywords field is ideal for searching for such specifics as aircraft registrations, photographers' names, specific airport/city names, specific paintschemes (i.e. 'Wunala Dreaming'), etc.\n\nTo use the Keywords field, begin by selecting a Keyworld search field. You may select either a specific database field (airline, aircraft, etc.), or choose to match your keyword to all database fields. Next, select a Keyword limiter. There are three options from which to choose:\n\n- is exactly\n\n- starts with\n\n- contains\n\nSelect the appropriate limiter for your search, then enter the keyword(s) you wish to search in the box on the right.

    "text": "The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is well-positioned for the future as it takes a long-term perspective in its planning.\n\nThis includes studying the latest-generation F-35 fighter jets and investing in advanced unmanned aerial vehicles, said Chief of Air Force Mervyn Tan.\n\nAs a small nation facing a future fraught with uncertainty and challenges, the commitment, dedication and resilience of RSAF's people will continue to play a critical role in safeguarding Singapore's sovereignty, he added.\n\nIn an e-mail interview released on Sunday ahead of the Singapore Airshow 2018, Major-General Tan gave his views on topics relating to the air force's 50th anniversary this year, future challenges and plans. The year-long celebrations will be launched tomorrow at the Airshow, where President Halimah Yacob will unveil an F-15SG fighter jet painted in RSAF50 colours.\n\nMG Tan said: \"The RSAF has always taken a long-term perspective in our planning. This approach has allowed us to invest in capabilities that not only meet our near-term defence needs, but also enable us to address evolving threats.\"\n\nOne example is the investment in advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs enhance the Singapore military's \"battlefield awareness as well as security agencies' ground situation awareness to better orchestrate responses for homeland security operations\", said MG Tan, who took over as air force chief in March 2016.\n\nWith the F-5s retired after reaching the end of their operational lifespan, the air force has upgraded its F-16s and is evaluating the F-35 as an option to further modernise the fighter fleet and maintain its combat edge, he said. \"This is to ensure that we continue to have a capable fighter fleet to defend Singapore's sovereignty and interests into the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe F-35B will be in Singapore for the first time at the biennial Airshow, which takes place from Feb 6 to 11 this year. The fifth-generation fighter aircraft has been developed by United States defence company Lockheed Martin.\n\nEmphasising the importance of the air force to Singapore as a small nation, MG Tan said airmen and women are trained to perform a wide spectrum of peacetime operations, such as humanitarian and disaster relief missions, besides defending Singapore's sovereignty.\n\nThe instances when the RSAF has responded to the call of duty include rescuing stranded passengers during the 1983 cable car disaster, participating in counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden and contributing to the Defeat ISIS Coalition in the Middle East, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the air force has overcome challenges such as training in Singapore's \"small and congested airspace\". This was done by conducting some training overseas and using simulators.\n\nMG Tan also pointed to the RSAF's people as its greatest strength. \"It is their professionalism, commitment and resilience that will enable us to achieve mission success,\" he said.\n\n\"With this firm foundation, I am confident that the RSAF will continue to be the deterrent, dependable and dominant force that is capable of defending Singapore's sovereignty and interests, and fly our flag high into the future.\""

Subsequently, Airbus will promote the aircraft to North American operators.\"During its tour, the C295 will demonstrate its advanced ISR capabilities as well as the platform's versatility and suitability for potential operators, especially in the Asian region,\" Airbus said. The company is also promoting the aircraft to meet regional requirements to enhance surveillance, search and rescue, transport, medical evacuation, and humanitarian missions.Airbus said the aircraft on display in Thailand is a model of the platform recently delivered to the Brazilian Air Force to meet its search and rescue and maritime patrol requirements.Airbus said it sees opportunities to supply the aircraft to the RTN, which is expected in the coming years to replace its ageing fleets of Dornier 228 and Fokker F27 Friendship patrol craft, which were acquired from the 1980s onwards.In addition, Airbus said it is seeking to expand sales of the C295 military transport aircraft to the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Royal Thai Army (RTA) took delivery in June 2016 of a single C295W transport aircraft, although it is understood that the service requires three additional platforms."
