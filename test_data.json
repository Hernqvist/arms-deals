Photo: Vipin Chandran\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Gifts\u2019 will pave the way for further strengthening bilateral relations, says Madivian Minister\n\n\n\nIndia on Saturday donated a second naval Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), Dhruv, to the Maldives in a gesture that was described by Maldivian Minister for Defence Mohamed Nazim as \u201cpaving the way for further strengthening of ties between both countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nA brand new, Mark-III (the latest) variant of the India-made multi-role helicopter in Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) colours was unveiled at a simple ceremony attended by Mr. Nazim, Vice-Admiral Satish Soni, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, and MNDF Brigadier General Ali Zuhair besides senior formations from both sides, officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and representatives of the helicopter manufacturer, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, at naval air station Garuda in Kochi.\n\n\n\nCordial relation\n\n\n\nOn the last leg of his India visit, Mr. Nazim said the Maldives maintained a friendly and cordial relation with its neighbours, especially India, which stood by the nation whenever it needed support. Defence cooperation between both countries grew drastically over the past few years with Indian armed forces, particularly the Navy, contributing greatly to MNDF\u2019s capacity-building. He said the \u2018gift\u2019 would help the island nation\u2019s Coast Guard carry out search and rescue and medical evacuation from its far-flung territories.\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni said India shared long-standing ties with Maldives. While Indian Navy trained MNDF personnel and despatched its ships and aircraft to patrol the Maldivian exclusive economic zone, the Maldives contributed to security in the Indian Ocean region by enhanced surveillance and anti-piracy patrol. The nation also actively participated in forums such as the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) and the biennial exercise Milan.\n\n\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni told the media later that provisioning the ALH, the face of India\u2019s aviation industry, was indicative of the importance India attached to its relationship with the island nation. While the ALH already in operation with the Maldivian Coast Guard was based at the southern Maldivian island of Addu, the more advanced, second helicopter \u2014 which also sports a weather radar\u2014 would operate from the northern Hannimadhoo Island, primarily on medical evacuation duty. The helicopter would be initially manned and maintained by an all-Indian crew.\n\n\n\nMaldives top priority\n\n\n\nThe Maldives topped India\u2019s priority alongside Bangladesh, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Defence cooperation between both countries was set for further growth, he said. As many as 16 MNDF personnel were presently undergoing training at India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, the Indian Navy\u2019s Training Command.\n\n\n\n(The Indian Navy has trained MNDF personnel since 1988. Maldivian defence personnel subscribe to at least 35 courses every year)\n\n\n\nT. Suvarna Raju, Director (Design and Development) of HAL, said the Mark-III variant of the indigenous chopper sported a digital cockpit and was capable of performing several roles.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-donates-second-naval-advanced-light-helicopter-to-maldives/article5456867.ece J'aime Je n'aime pas\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSujet: Re: Maldives National Defence Force Dim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32 Sujet: Re: Maldives National Defence ForceDim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW !!

But the reason behind the demotion is unclear.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Fayaz's lawyers are looking to appeal the decision by the Criminal Court to deny a habeas corpus writ over his detention.\n\n\n\nCriminal Court on Wednesday denied a habeus corpus writ over the detention of Fayaz.\n\n\n\nThe court said the writ request was rejected by its registrar as the defence ministry denied detaining Fayaz inside the military headquarters.\n\n\n\nFayaz\u2019s attorney Mahfooz Saeed had said he would seek the intervention of the Criminal Court judges in order to nullify the decision by the court\u2019s registrar.\n\n\n\nGovernment had also blamed army officers in charge of the armoury for the weapons stash found following the blast from an uninhabited island, labelling them as having had committed treason.\n\n\n\nThe weapons found from the island of Hinbalhidhoo in Baa Atoll, which is being developed as a tourist resort, included several hand guns, a T56 assault rifle and a MP5 sub-machine gun. In addition, a large quantity of bomb making material was also discovered.\n\n\n\nThe military had confirmed that the two rifles found in the island were from the state armoury.\n\n\n\nThe primary suspect in the weapons stash seized from the Hibilhadhoo island has, meanwhile, denied any connection to the weapons. Mohamed Allam Latheef is one of the four shareholders of a company that owns Hibilhadhoo.\n\n\n\nLocal authorities, meanwhile, has identified Allam and seven others as wanted in two separate cases related to the explosion aboard the presidential speedboat late September, now confirmed as an attempt to kill the president.\n\n\n\nThe now deposed Vice President Ahmed Adheeb Abdul Ghafoor was arrested over the blast shortly after. He has since been impeached after the ruling coalition lawmakers moved a no-confidence motion through the government controlled parliament.\n\n\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim were travelling to Male from the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport (INIA), located on the nearby island of Hulhule which is a five-minute ferry ride from the capital city, on September 28 when the explosion took place.

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Combined weapon sales from American companies for fiscal 2018 were up 13 percent over fiscal 2017 figures, netting American firms $192.3 billion, according to new numbers released Thursday by the State Department.\n\nThe department previously announced that FY18 brought in $55.66 billion in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over FY17\u2019s $41.93 billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry.\n\nWhat had not been released until now is the total direct commercial sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy systems from industry. Those figures topped $136.6 billion for FY18, a 6.6 percent increase from FY17\u2019s $128.1 billion.\n\nThe Trump administration has made selling American defense goods abroad a key plank of its governance plan, under the guiding principal that \u201ceconomic security is national security.\u201d Earlier this year, the department rolled out its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy, or CAT, as well as new guidance for selling unmanned systems, with the explicit goal of increasing arms sales.\n\nState official predicts US weapon sales increase in 2019 U.S. firms could be poised for a bonanza of weapon sales in FY 2019.\n\nHowever, tying this year\u2019s figures to the CAT changes may be a stretch. Sales can fluctuate year by year because of the size of certain weapons packages; a pair of large Saudi Arabian purchases in 2012 famously set that year up for a massive $287 billion annual total.\n\nAnd there has already been steady growth each of the last three years, even before the Trump administration\u2019s reforms kicked in, with $148.6 billion in total sales in FY16; $170 billion in FY17; and $192.2 billion in FY18.\n\nA State Department official, speaking on background ahead of the official release of these figures, acknowledged to Defense News that these figures can\u2019t be tied directly to changes in policy, noting they represent a \u201cdynamic picture\u201d and that the department is aware there are some factors \u201cwe do not control.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nStill, the official expressed confidence that as the CAT policy is enacted, it will lead to a natural growth in sales. How much, however, is hard to nail down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on a particular goal that we\u2019re looking at\u201d for FY19, the official said. \u201cWe think a 13 percent increase is a significant increase year over year. We\u2019d like to maintain that pace, but there are other factors that go into a given set of annual numbers, so I\u2019m hesitant to give a target goal.\u201d\n\nThanks to both the CAT changes and export reform efforts beginning under the Obama administration, there are more options for countries to use direct commercial sales, or DCS, for their procurements.\n\nAsked if that meant DCS might grow as FMS cases drop, the official said that is \u201cone dynamic\u201d under review, but noted that \u201cas certain systems start going through DCS, you\u2019ll have new systems backfilling the FMS queue.\u201d"

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Russia is currently unable to find a source for the critical carbon fiber components needed to make one of its hypersonic weapons, despite President Vladimir Putin's claims that the device has already entered serial production, according to people with direct knowledge of a U.S. intelligence report. A hypersonic weapon can travel at least five times the speed of sound, or about one mile per second. What's more, the U.S. is currently unable to defend against this breed of threat. The Kremlin considers their current carbon fiber material unreliable and is therefore looking for another source. Yet, the people added, Moscow has prioritized the program, and so the weapon is still on track to achieve initial operational capability by 2020. The next flight test is slated for December, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The body of the hypersonic glide vehicle cannot withstand the heat on re-entry, and therefore the internal systems fail,\" this person explained to CNBC. \"The Russians therefore need a better material because they have an upcoming test and they don't think the material used to construct the body provides enough thermal protection.\"\n\nRussia expects the carbon fiber components to be produced within 12 months of selection and still expects to meet its 2020 deadline, according to the person. \"It's intriguing that they continue to run into problems, because they've been flight-testing this system for a long time,\" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. \"They're running into the same problems that anyone else would run into if they would do this, and it gets back to the issue, of course, how important is this for Russia?\" he added, noting Moscow's ambition to develop hypersonic weapons. Read more: Hypersonic weapons: What they are, and why the U.S. can't defend against them A spokesman for the Pentagon expressed skepticism about Russia's hypersonic development. \"Obviously, Russian attempts to develop high-tech weaponry is something we watch closely. To this point, however, we've seen more grandiose claims of success than actual proof,\" said Defense Department spokesman Eric Pahon. \"We are continuing to develop our own defensive capabilities and improve readiness for both ourselves and our allies to counter any threats the Russians may develop.\" The latest revelations come less than eight months after Putin touted his nation's growing hypersonic arsenal as \"invincible.\" The hypersonic glide vehicle, dubbed Avangard, was one of the six weapons Putin presented in March. Avangard is designed to sit atop an intercontinental ballistic missile and uses aerodynamic forces to sail on top of the atmosphere. Putin claimed Avangard was capable of reaching targets at a speed of 20 times the speed of sound and strikes \"like a fireball.\" He also said that the hypersonic warhead had already entered serial production. \"Certainly, heat management is a huge challenge; you know, you have this thing that is going through the atmosphere at very high speeds and potentially for a long period of time,\" said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The longer you are in the atmosphere, the more heat you have to manage, and that's been a huge challenge for the U.S. in hypersonics, and, in part, it's really a material science challenge,\" Acton added, noting the significant costs associated with testing and producing hypersonic weapons.\n\nA display of a flight of the warhead of the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide weapon.

The unmanned air vehicles are expected to be completed by 31 March 2020, according to a US Defense Department contract notice online.\n\nThe US State Department approved the sale of four MQ-5 Block 5 Reapers to Spain for $243 million in 2015. That deal would have included 20 embedded global positioning system and inertial guidance units, two mobile ground control stations, five multi-spectral targeting systems and five synthetic aperture radars. Also proposed was contractor logistics support for two years and personnel training, as well as aircraft components, spares and accessories.\n\nAt the time, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Security Cooperation Agency determined the sale would enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability of the Spanish military.\n\n\u201cCommonality of ISR capabilities increases interoperability between US and Spanish forces and provides a common interface with other MQ-9 NATO operators, including the United Kingdom, France and Italy,\u201d said the agency\u2019s notice. \u201cThe Spanish Air Force intends to use the MQ-9s for homeland security, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism operations. The proposed sale improves Spain\u2019s ability to meet current and future threats by providing improved ISR coverage that promotes increased battlefield situational awareness, anticipates enemy intent, augments combat search and rescue, and provides ground troop support.\u201d\n\nSpain is the latest European NATO country to sign up for General Atomics\u2019 drones.

    "text": "ROME \u2014 Italy has spent slightly more than \u20ac5 billion (U.S. $5.7 billion) on defense procurement in 2018 and launched a series of new programs, a newly released spending document has revealed.\n\nPublished months behind schedule, the Defence Ministry document also states that the ministry\u2019s overall budget, which includes its contribution to procurement as well as funds for personnel and maintenance and operations, stood at \u20ac13.8 billion this year, up from \u20ac13.2 billion the year before.\n\nThe total budget for procurement combines a \u20ac2.3 billion contribution from the Defence Ministry funding with a \u20ac2.8 billion top-up from Italy\u2019s Ministry of Economic Development, which has long shored up acquisition funding.\n\nA chart published in the document shows that procurement funding from the defense ministry has risen 83 percent from \u20ac1.5 billion in 2008, and overtook Defence Ministry procurement in 2016 for the first time.\n\nThe figures are contained in Italy\u2019s annual defense spending document, which is due to be examined by the Italian parliament\u2019s defense commission next week and has been seen by Defense News.\n\nItaly plans to slash half a billion dollars from defense in 2019 Italy will suspend helicopter and missile purchases and cancel an office move by the defense ministry, a defense source has told Defense News, and also slow roll F-35 buys.\n\nThe document breaks down spending per program in 2018 and lists new programs receiving funding for the first time, including four new Chinook helicopters for special forces troops, which will cost \u20ac528 million over nine years.\n\nLaunch funding is also allotted for the purchase of a third pair of U212 submarines for the Italian Navy, a program due to cost a total of \u20ac2.35 billion. There is also launch funding for a second pair of Cosmo Skymed Second Generation radar satellites which will cost a total of \u20ac212 million.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nAlso included in the budget is funding to launch the purchase of a new submarine rescue vessel which will cost a total of \u20ac424 million.\n\nUsually published in the spring, the release of the budget overview has been held up by a change of government, which saw a center-left administration replaced in June by a populist coalition.\n\nThe new government\u2019s defense budget plans are yet to be finalized as the overall state budget is still being worked on, but a source has already told Defense News that \u20ac450 million are to be trimmed from planned spending to help fund social welfare programs."

The supply of these Russian weapons is expected for this year.\n\n\n\nMobile launcher unit TEL Transporter Erector Launcher of S-300PS air defense missile system at military parade in Armenia (Picture source Armenian MoD)\n\nThe agreement on the loan for Armenia to buy Russian weapons was signed on October 24, 2017. The loan was provided with a 3% annual interest. In June 2015, Russia signed an agreement with Armenia on a state export loan worth $200 mln to finance deliveries of Russian weapons. The loan maturity was 13 years with a three-year grace period and a 3% annual interest rate.\n\nDrozhzhov said Russia and Uzbekistan have inked a contract to deliver more than 10 Mi-35 helicopters. \"We signed a contract for Mi-35 helicopters. The work is successful, and military-technical cooperation with Uzbekistan is actively developing,\" he said.\n\nDrozhzhov said \"over ten craft\" will be supplied. A diplomatic source earlier told TASS 12 Mi-35 helicopters have to be delivered. Drozhzhov said Russia hopes to ink a deal to deliver S-400 antiaircraft missiles to India in 2018.\n\nIn January, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said in an interview published on the Indian Defense News portal that negotiations for the contract entered the advanced stage and the parties were discussing technical details. In October 2016, the states inked an intergovernmental agreement on deliveries of the weapons.\n\nThe contract for the delivery of MiG-35 fighter jets to Kazakhstan has not been inked yet. \"Work is ongoing but so far there are no contracted commitments,\" Drozhzhov said. He added it was too early to speak about a possible creation of a joint Russian-Kazakh venture to produce MiG-35 in the country.\n\nThe MiG Corporation earlier said Kazakhstan can become a major buyer of the new fighter jet. An agreement was signed at MAKS-2017 airshow between MiG and Kazakhstan Engineering on the promotion of MiG-35 in Kazakhstan and the creation of servicing and production facilities to localize the production of units of the aircraft.\n\n\n\nSince 2010 and according to the SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) arms trade database, Armenia has taken delivery of many military equipment from Russia including two S-300PS/SA-10C air defense missile systems, 10 armoured vehicle Tigr, 400 MANPADS Igla-S/SA-24, 25 Iskander ballistic missile, 6 BM-30 9A52 Smerch MLRS 300mm Multiple Launch Rocket system, 200 Verba SA-25, and undisclosed number of anti-tank missiles 9M133 Kornet/AT-14."

    "text": "The KATUSA program arose from a shared history of war with North Korea. Both American and South Korean troops fought together, so it made sense to make it official.\n\nGen. Douglas MacArthur and South Korean Pres. Syngman Rhee crafted the arrangement in 1950, and both viewed these \u201caugmentees\u201d as critical to their shared war efforts.\n\nIn June 1950, a North Korean blitzkrieg had pushed Washington and Seoul\u2019s ill-prepared troops into a tiny pocket around the port city of Busan at the southeastern tip of the peninsula.\n\nWith Pyongyang\u2019s forces closing in, MacArthur was desperate for more manpower. Rhee wanted to find ways to improve his fledgling army.\n\nThe chaos of war, along with a cultural and language barriers\u2014and just flat out racism\u2014caused serious difficulties for the program. While in need of extra soldiers, many American commanders distrusted or dismissed the Korean volunteers.\n\n\u201cAn inordinately large percentage of men, particularly in some units, stated at KATUSAs were no good, that they would sleep on guard, \u2018bug out,\u2019 refuse to work or pretend not to know what was expected of them,\u201d an Army team sent to evaluate the service\u2019s performance reported.\n\nDespite orders from Pres. Harry Truman to integrate, Eighth Army had arrived in Korea with official racial boundaries still firmly in place.\n\n\u201cThis mistrust may stem from fact or it may result from pre-existing attitudes,\u201d the team explained. \u201cMany people made the statement that a KATUSA or Puerto Rican or Negro is either an excellent fighter, or he is no good at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf such \u2018extremes\u2019 exist it seems highly likely that they are not inherited.\u201d\n\nIn spite of these barriers, more than 6,000 KATUSAs had given their lives by the end of the war. After the Korean Armistice Agreement stopped the shooting, the Pentagon kept the program going as an established method of training South Korean troops.\n\nNearly 10 years after the armistice, Washington and Seoul agreed to use the arrangement to bulk up Army units throughout the country. In 1968, there were still more than 10,000 KATUSAs aiding the ground combat branch in Korea, according to one Pentagon memo.\n\nThe relative skill level between South Korean troops and their American comrades\u2014and perhaps continuing mistrust\u2014was still an issue. \u201cKATUSA personnel cannot be used in intelligence units to replace U.S. personnel,\u201d the Pentagon memo declared.\n\nAnd for decades, the U.S. essentially had veto power over the South Korean military. The American officer in charge of the Eighth Army \u2014 who had a shared headquarters with South Korean troops called the Combined Forces Command \u2014 was the de facto highest ranking military official in the country.\n\nIn 1994, the two countries finally agreed to allow South Korea\u2014an established sovereign state and growing regional economic powerhouse\u2014to oversee its own military affairs \u2026 during peacetime.\n\nToday, if another war broke out on the peninsula, the Pentagon would still direct South Korean troops at the highest levels."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe Russian government has reportedly cancelled an upgraded variant of the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) Project 955A Borei II-class (\u201cNorth Wind\u201d) or Dolgorukiy-class following a cost-effectiveness analysis, according to a Russian defense industry source.\n\nThe so-called Borei B-class (Borei III) of SSBNs, which was expected to feature a new water jet propulsion system, an upgraded hull, and new noise reduction technology, next to others, is also apparently no longer listed in Russia\u2019s state armament program for 2018-2027. An earlier draft had included a provision for the construction of four Borei B-class subs.\n\n\u201cAfter the analysis of proposals on building Borei-B nuclear-powered submarines, a decision was made to give them up as the project of building these subs does not meet the \u2018cost/efficiency\u2019 criterion. Instead, the final version of the state armament program through 2027 includes Borei-A [Borei II-class] submarines,\u201d the source told TASS news agency on May 21.\n\nThe decision to scratch an upgraded variant of the boomers comes as no surprise as senior defense industry officials have repeatedly voiced their unhappiness with the Borei B-class design work done by the Rubin Central Design Bureau for Marine Engineering in St. Petersburg. The head of Russia\u2019s United Shipbuilding Corporation, Alexey Rakhmanov, in a March interview, said, \u201cI believe we can talk about it in late 2018\u2026 Borey B concept R&D [research and development] was fulfilled last year. The conceptual design was unsatisfactory in economic feasibility. We shall return to the issue.\u201d\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) has plans to build six additional Borei II-class (also designated Borei-A) SSBNs in addition to the five already ordered, which eventually will bring up the total number of Borei-class ballistic missile subs to 14.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the new series of Project 955A submarines will begin at the Sevmash Shipyard after 2023,\u201d the source added. \u201cOverall, there are plans to build six Borei-A subs, which will be operational in the Northern and Pacific Fleets. With the completion of this series, the Navy will operate 14 new strategic nuclear-powered submarines: 11 Borei-A-and three Borei-class subs.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Navy is slated to receive Borei II-class SSBN Knyaz Vladimir (Prince Vladimir) in 2019, following a two-year delay due to a contract dispute between the Russian MoD and the Severodvinsk-based Sevmash Shipyards. Borei II-class SSBNs reportedly have increased maneuverability, upgraded stealth capabilities, and carry additional missiles than the original Borei-class (See: \u201cRussia Will Start Constructing New Ballistic Missile Submarine in December\u201d):\n\nIn comparison to the Borei-class, Borei II[A]-class submarines are fitted with four additional missile tubes, boast smaller hulls and cons, and feature improved acoustics and lower sound levels, next to a number of other technical improvements. Both variants of Borei-class subs will be armed with Bulava (RSM-56) intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Borei-class will be capable of carrying up to 16 Bulava ICBMs, whereas the improved Borei II-class can carry up to 20 ballistic missiles. The improved variant of the Borei-class will be capable of launching 96-200 hypersonic, independently maneuverable warheads, yielding 100-150 kilotons apiece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Russian Navy currently operates three Borei-class boomers. The Borei-class SSBN Yuri Dolgoruky is in service with Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, while the remaining two \u2013 Alexander Nevsky and Vladimir Monomakh \u2014 are deployed with the Russian Pacific Fleet."

The newly delivered aircraft will now be assembled in Nigeria by a team of Pakistan Air Force and NAF technicians prior to test flying and formal induction into the NAF.\n\nAir Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, Director of Public Relations and Information at the Nigerian Air Force, said in a statement that the NAF took delivery of the first batch of five new Super Mushshaks on 14 July 2017, following which the aircraft were inducted and deployed for primary training of NAF pilots.

The AF-1C is based on the TA-4KU two-seat fighter. The aircraft was delivered to the AF-1/1A Aircraft Inspection and Receiving Group on April 23 in Gavi\u00e3o Peixoto, Brazil.\n\n\n\nBrazil signed a contract to upgrade nine single-seat A-4KU's to the AF-1B standard and three TA-4KU's to the AF-1C standard in 2009. The contract, awarded to Embraer, was worth $140 million. The first aircraft, an A-4KU, was delivered in May 2015. However, delays mounted after that and by July 2017, Brazil even considered cancelling the program. Ultimately, Brasilia decided against that move, and the program now seems to be back on track.\n\n\n\nUpgrades include a new electric power generation system, a new multimode radar, a glass cockpit, and a new weapons management system. In addition, prime contractor Embraer developed a new suite of mission software.\n\n\n\nThe aircraft, with a serial number N-1022, will be used by training and operational qualification pilots of the 1st Squadron of Intercept and Attack Aircraft (EsqdVF-1). In addition, \"Falcon 1022\" may participate in various operational tasks of the Squadron.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

It seemed as though the education budget increased under the current government, but in reality, it didn\u2019t because the budget was for two ministries \u2013 the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Science and Technology,\u201d he explained, as the NLD government had incorporated the Ministry of Science and Technology into the education ministry.\n\nThe budget proposed by the Health and Sports Ministry was only 400 billion kyats for a six months period, and that amount is not sufficient to spend both on the health and sports sectors, he added.\n\nDeputy Minister for Defense Maj-Gen Myint Nwe told Parliament that the Defense Ministry is expected to earn 31.761 billion kyats in normal revenue; its capital expenditure is expected to be 611.087 billion kyats; its normal expenditure, 723.107 billion kyats; and total expenditure is, therefore, 1.33 trillion kyats for the six-month transitional period.\n\nHe told Parliament, \u201cThe money is used to implement plans to strengthen the structure of soldiers, weapons, equipment for perpetuity of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Union.\u201d\n\nLower House lawmaker U Tun Tun of Pwintbyu Township, who was on the budget scrutinizing committee, said that the defense budget is rarely cut, but when the Defense Ministry asked for an additional budgetary top-up for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the committee cut around 280 million kyats because government agencies are restricted by law from obtaining an extra budget of more than 10 percent of their main budget.\n\n\u201cThe defense budget has never been trimmed. However, we will check whether the army asked for its budget in accordance with financial rules and regulations. If we find that the budget was increased unnecessarily, we will scrutinize and cut it,\u201d he said.\n\nTo compare the defense budgets for normal expenditures, the Defense Ministry asked for 609.627 billion kyats for the first half of 2016-17 FY, 827.149 billion kyats for the first half of 2017-18 FY, and 723.107 billion kyats for the six-month period in 2018.\n\nAnd to compare the defense budgets for capital expenditures, it asked for 168.498 billion kyats for the first half of 2016-17 FY, 622.440 billion kyats for the first half of 2017-18 FY, and 618.017 billion kyats for the six-month period.\n\nTranslated from Burmese by Myint Win Thein."

(Reuters Photo/Adnan Abidi)\n\nJakarta. There is no risk of US sanctions following Indonesia's $1.14 billion deal to purchase 11 Sukhoi fighter jets from Russia, an official said on Monday (13/08).\n\n\"There is no pressure from the US regarding this [...] We are targeting to finish [the transaction] as soon as possible,\" Oke Nurwan, director general of foreign trade at the Ministry of Trade, told reporters.\n\nOke's words contradict his last week's statement that the United States has \"started to intervene\" after Russia agreed to the Sukhoi deal in February.\n\nIndonesia is going to buy the jets in a counter-purchase deal, in which Russia will buy Indonesian commodities for 50 percent of the Sukhoi price. Russia is currently reviewing the agreement. The commodities include rubber, tea, coffee, palm oil and its derivatives, and textiles.\n\n\"We are now still drafting the rules for a working group to discuss the commodities that Russia must buy from Indonesia in return,\" Oke said.\n\nThe working group will consist of officials from Indonesia Trading Company (PPI) and Russia's military contracting company Rostec.\n\nOn Saturday, Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said the aircraft are scheduled to start arriving in October next year.\n\nIn August 2017, President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia to punish President Vladimir Putin for the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The sanctions extend to all US allies that purchase Russian weapons and equipment."

    "text": "India has decided to supply four Mi-35 attack helicopters to Afghanistan over the next four months to help the war-ravaged nation intensify its anti-terror operations against the Pakistan-backed Taliban, Afghan diplomatic sources said.\n\nSources said India proposed to go in for outright purchase of the Russian-made helicopters from Belarus since it would have taken a long time to procure the choppers if it were to place an order for their supplies.\n\nIndia had supplied four Mi-25 attack helicopters to Afghanistan in 2015-16 to bolster the strength of the Afghan forces while refusing to make any compromise on its long-standing stand that there shall be no Indian boots on the ground in the embattled country. Lately, India has been deeply concerned over an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan unleashed by the Taliban, which continues to receive support from the Pakistani establishment.\n\nSources said India\u2019s decision to supply four more helicopters to Afghanistan was taken after the US and other key Western powers nudged New Delhi to play a pro-active role in stabilising the situation in the country. India is already giving training to nearly 1,000 Afghan soldiers in its premier defence institutions.\n\nThe US has found itself handicapped in assisting the Afghan forces because most of the lethal military equipment with them is of Russian origin. Quite a few helicopters with the Afghan forces have been grounded due to lack of spare parts.\n\nThe US and NATO member countries are prohibited from purchasing Russian-made military hardware, including the parts needed to repair the helicopters given the Western-imposed sanctions on Russia. Consequently, the US government has repeatedly requested Indian military assistance to the AAF since 2014.\n\nSources, meanwhile, said India and Afghanistan also propose to soon hold in Kabul the next meeting of the strategic council between them to consider ways to enhance the fighting prowess of the Afghan forces. The council had held its last meeting in New Delhi last year.\n\nSources said the US, too, has started implementing its four-year defence plan in Afghanistan. Under the plan, the strength of the Afghan Air Force (AAF) will be increased three-fold. The capability of Afghan special forces will also be enhanced substantially.\n\nOn the air corridor established between India and Afghanistan last year to circumvent the problems being created by Pakistan for trade between them, sources said it had indeed helped the two countries increase trade and commercial links. As a result, trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan had decreased considerably."

    "text": "Defense Secretary James Mattis has warned Turkey against buying a Russian air defense system. He cautioned Turkey, a sovereign state and NATO member, that the US does \u201cnot recommend\u201d the purchase.\n\n\u201cTurkey had a choice to make, a sovereign decision to make. But clearly Turkey bringing a Russian anti-aircraft, anti-missile system into a NATO country, we cannot integrate that into NATO,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYes, it does concern us and we do not recommend that.\u201d\n\nThe US blocked the sale of American-made F-35 jet fighters to Turkey earlier this month in response to Ankara\u2019s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 air defense system. However, Turkey intends to press ahead with the purchase, and already made the first payment for the system last year. Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport said that the first batch of S-400 systems will be delivered to Turkey next year.\n\nRead more\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended his decision to buy from Russia, arguing that the US has turned down his requests for more hardware for years.\n\n\u201cAre we going to depend on the U.S. again?\u201d the Turkish strongman said in June. \u201cWhen we have been demanding from them for years, the answer that has been given to us is: The [U.S.] Congress is not allowing.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Erdogan added that he fully intended to put the new defense systems to use. \u201cWe will not just buy the S-400s and place them in a storehouse. We will use them if need be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a defense system. What are we going to do with it if not use this defense system?\u201d\n\nThe deepening rift between the US and Turkey over the S-400 has been exacerbated by Turkey\u2019s continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Brunson has been held in Turkey since 2016 over alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt against Erdogan\u2019s government, and is facing 35 years in prison.\n\nAs the war of words over Brunson escalated, US President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkish imports up to 50 and 20 percent respectively earlier this month. Ankara retaliated by raising tariffs on 22 American-made products, ranging from cars to tobacco and also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the US move.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!"

The F4 is also able to operate with the Scalp cruise missiles.\n\nLooking back to the standards of the Rafale, the F1 standard was the first version for the A\u00e9ronautique Navale (French Navy). These Rafale Ms were equipped for air-to-air operations, but lacked any armaments for air-to-ground missions.\n\nF2 standard gave the Rafale also air-to-ground and reconnaissance capabilities. The latest versions, F3 and F3R, gave the aircraft nuclear capabilities and it can operate with the most advanced air-to-air missiles and precision ground attacks munitions."

The vehicle is manufactured by the 140th Repair Plant in Boriso.\n\nUnveiled in 2015, the Cayman armoured vehicle weighs about 7 000kg and can carry six people including the crew. Its steel monocoque hull provides STANAG 4569 Level 3 protection and has a V-shaped hull. The vehicle is powered by a Minsk Motor Plant D-245.30E2 diesel engine delivering 170 hp, giving a maximum road speed of 110 km/h and 8 km/h in water with the use of water-jets.\n\nVarious weapons systems and turrets can be mounted, including an Adunok remotely controlled weapons station or machineguns and automatic grenade launchers. It can reach speeds of up to 110 km/h on ideal road conditions and has a range of 1,000 kilometres. Belarus is believed to have begun putting the vehicle into service with its military since May 2017.\n\nThe Ivory Coast\u2019s Gendarmerie operates French VAB and BTR-80 armoured personnel carriers as well as the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle \u2013 one of the latter was seen in the 7 August parade. Its Army operates Bastion and Saxon armoured personnel carriers.\n\nAnother recent addition to the Ivory Coast\u2019s military is two second hand Antonov An-26B transports, formerly operated by Rose Air. They were delivered on 19 and 23 July and go a long way in rejuvenating the country\u2019s tiny air force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Ivory Coast has only received a few items of military equipment since the 2011 civil war, including a Predator patrol craft from China, three RPB 33 patrol boats from France and four AT-105 Saxon armoured patrol vehicles for use in United Nations operations in Mali."

    "text": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - China has granted more than $100 million in military aid to Cambodia, Cambodia said on Tuesday, highlighting the strong ties between Beijing and a government that critics accuse of destroying democracy ahead of an election next month.\n\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\n\nPrime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s ruling party is expected to easily win the general election on July 29 as the Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) last November at the government\u2019s request.\n\nThe military aid was offered by China\u2019s defense minister Wei Fenghe, who is in Phnom Penh to attend a China-Cambodia military exhibition, on a visit that began on June 16 and will end on Wednesday.\n\nCambodian Defence Ministry spokesman Chhum Sucheat said Wei \u201cpledged more than $100 million grant\u201d to be used for whatever Cambodia required, and that the Chinese and Cambodian armies would conduct joint exercises, dubbed \u201cDragon Gold\u201d, again next year.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t specify what we can buy, just for use for any necessary need,\u201d the spokesman told Reuters.\n\nWei, in a statement carried by China\u2019s Defence Ministry, said Cambodia was a \u201cloyal friend\u201d and China stood by it as it \u201cpursued a development path that accords with its national condition\u201d.\n\nChina is Cambodia\u2019s biggest aid donor and its backing has bolstered Hun Sen, who has ruled the country for 33 years.\n\nThe ban on Cambodia\u2019s opposition was condemned by the United States, the European Union and other countries. Hun Sen has accused the United States of supporting the CNRP and plotting a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d to overthrow his government.\n\nThe opposition party and the United States denied that.\n\nCambodia has suspended joint military exercises with the United States indefinitely, but has held exercises with China twice since 2016."
