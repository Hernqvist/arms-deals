    "text": "Russia and China are about to kick-off the operational phase of their first ever European joint naval exercises in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe exercise is an indication of the growing strategic partnership between the Kremlin and Beijing. For China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, the Maritime Cooperation-2017 exercise is an opportunity to demonstrate its global reach and to show its support for a strategic partner. For the Kremlin, the war games are an important demonstration to show that Moscow has friends\u2014if not allies\u2014despite its isolation from the West.\n\n\"The first stage of the Russian-Chinese naval exercises \u2018Maritime Cooperation-2017\u2019 will be held from July 21 to July 28. It consists of two stages - a coastal stage, from July 21 to July 24, and an active sea stage, from July 25 to July 28,\u201d Russian Baltic Fleet official Roman Martov told the TASS news agency.\n\n\u201cIt is the first time in the history of Russian-Chinese relations that Chinese warships visit Baltiysk.\u201d\n\nChina has deployed have deployed three vessels to the Baltic Sea for the exercise, the Type 052D destroyer Hefei, the Type 054A frigate Yuncheng and the Type 903A supply ship Luoma Lake. The Russian Navy is deploying advanced Project 20380 class corvettes\u2014Steregushchy herself and Boiky. The Russians are also deploying Kamov Ka-27 Helix anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters and Sukhoi Su-24 Fencer bombers for the exercise.\n\nThe exercises are an indication of a closer partnership between Moscow and Beijing, but falls short of a formal military alliance\u2014analysts in both Russia and the United States said.\n\n\u201cFull alliance means a written commitment to support each other militarily. We are not likely to have such a treaty in the foreseeable future. But the actual level of defense cooperation and policy coordination is that of an alliance,\u201d Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics told The National Interest.\n\nRetired Rear Adm. Mike McDevitt, a senior fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses, told The National Interest that while Beijing and Moscow are getting closer there is not likely to be a new strategic alliance between the two.\n\n\u201cThey are getting closer,\u201d McDevitt said. \u201cBut, none of the experts I know believe they are headed toward a formal alliance. Neither nation is prepared to go beyond the \u2018strategic partnership\u2019 rubric.\u201d\n\nFrom the Russian point of view, U.S. and Western-led interventions to overthrow various regimes around the world and perceived encroachment upon Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space have driven the Kremlin and Beijing towards greater cooperation. Indeed, China has its own list of grievances with the U.S.-led liberal world order\u2014which some realist scholars also refer to as a liberal hegemony.\n\n\u201cThat process is basically the result of the simultaneously growing U.S. tensions with China in the Pacific and with Russia in Europe and the process has been going on for a long time. It sped up during the Obama administration,\u201d Kashin said.\n\n\u201cIf there was no U.S. pressure, the two sides would maintain close relations but would avoid getting too close.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how closely the Russians and Chinese will operate during their exercises.\n\n\u201cIn both air defense and ASW exercises it is altogether possible that both the Russians and the Chinese are reluctant to go beyond heavily choreographed events out of a combination of safety reasons, avoiding embarrassingly poor performance, or revealing too much operational information to the other side,\u201d McDevitt said.\n\n\u201cUnder any circumstances, language difficulties are real-world exercise constraints. Nonetheless, at the publicly observable level, and based upon the statements of public affairs officers these exercises are notable for their increasing size and complexity, their greater realism, and the wider array of operations conducted.\u201d\n\nWhile the Russian-Chinese exercises definitely have practical military value, leaders in Moscow and Beijing are also sending a geo-political message to the West. The two great powers intend to make naval operations near their shores as costly as possible for the United States and its allies.\n\n\u201cIt's a statement game. Seventy-plus years ago Nicholas Spykman wrote that a dominant sea power is only dominant if it commands the \u2018marginal seas\u2019 around the perimeter of Eurasia,\u201d James Holmes, professor of strategy at the U.S. Naval War College, told The National Interest.\n\n\u201cThe Royal Navy commanded those waters during its age of maritime supremacy, and we've commanded them during ours. In effect the Russo-Chinese entente is putting everyone on notice that it can deny access to the marginal seas, or at least drive the costs of access so high that Western leaders will blanch at paying them.\u201d\n\nEffectively, the message from Moscow and Beijing is that the era of Western\u2014and particularly American\u2014naval dominance is coming to a close. But there are questions as to how durable the partnership is between the two great Eurasian powers. Moscow and Beijing have had troubled relations in previous decades during the Soviet-era where tensions have nearly spilled over into open warfare between the two.\n\n\u201cThe message is that the end of the age of Western maritime mastery is at hand. A couple of bonus effects - the PLA Navy gets to show it can operate effectively very far from home, while Moscow and Beijing get to make a show of unity,\u201d Holmes said.\n\n\u201cMany, including myself, doubt how durable a Russo-Chinese entente will be over the long haul. We may be right, but they're showing they could make a lot of trouble in the short haul.\u201d\n\nOlga Oliker, director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed that the Sino-Russian naval exercises are designed to send a specific message out. However, Moscow and Beijing are sending different signals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to separate out the signals each country is likely trying to send. From Russia\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s of course the usual reminder that this is their neighborhood, where of course they will exercise. Bringing China in sends the signal that they have friends, if not allies,\u201d Oliker said.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s involvement is more interesting. It\u2019s kind of amazing how over a fairly short period China has gone from a country that doesn\u2019t do exercises with other countries, to one deploying into the Baltic Sea. To some extent, this is a show of support for Russia and its right to defend its sovereignty and act in waters near its territory. I think China is also sending the signal that it, too has territorial waters, and also that it, too, is a global actor. But I wouldn\u2019t read into it that China is thinking it would get involved in any Russian adventures in Europe, though, should those be in the cards.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line for the United States is that Russia and China are drawing closer together with the goal of challenging Washington\u2019s global dominance. Historically, the United States has sought to prevent the rise of a regional hegemony or alliance that could dominate the Eurasian landmass. Unfortunately, American foreign policy over the last 25-years might have inadvertently forced two former enemies to cooperate to do just that.\n\nDave Majumdar is the defense editor of The National Interest.

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The U.S. Air Force has selected Lockheed Martin to design and prototype a new hypersonic cruise missile, as part of a broad Pentagon push to kickstart America\u2019s hypersonic arsenal.\n\nThe indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for the \u201cdesign, development, engineering, systems integration, test, logistics planning, and aircraft integration support of all the elements of a hypersonic, conventional, air-launched, stand-off weapon\u201d was announced by the service April 18.\n\nThe total value for Lockheed could be as high as $928 million over the course of the program\u2019s unspecified timeline. The program is known formally as the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon.\n\n\u201cThis effort is one of two hypersonic weapon prototyping efforts being pursued by the Air Force to accelerate hypersonics research and development,\u201d service spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said in a statement. \u201cThe Air Force is using prototyping to explore the art-of-the-possible and to advance these technologies to a capability as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe other prototyping program referenced by Stefanek is the Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon. In its FY19 budget request, the Air Force asked for $258 million for the two prototyping experiments.\n\nThe service is also working on two science and technology hypersonic programs, in conjunction with DARPA. Those are the Tactical Boost Glide program, which expects to have a prototype in the 2022-2023 timeframe, and the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC.\n\nHypersonic flight is defined as anything about Mach 5, meaning five times the speed of sound. Such a weapon, if successfully developed, would be able to skirt past existing air defenses and hold enemy forces at risk from great ranges. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson has previously started a focus on developing the technology.\n\n\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nStefanek noted the dollar amount represents the \u201cestimated face value\u201d for the project and is not a full commitment from the service. Money will be given out through a series of tasking orders, the first of which will come in the next few weeks.\n\nThe announcement comes as Pentagon officials, most vocally Undersecretary of Defense and Research Michael Griffin, have openly called for the need of more investment into hypersonic technology.\n\n\u201cThe most significant advance by our adversaries has been the Chinese development of what is now today a pretty mature system for conventional prompt strike at multi thousand kilometer ranges,\u201d Griffin told the House Armed Services Committee during an April 17 hearing. \u201cWe will, with today\u2019s defensive systems, not see these things coming.\u201d"

By 2035, Russia stands to have a fleet of 13 heavy icebreakers, including nine nuclear-powered ones, he said.\n\nThe Russian leader said that Russia plans to expand the ports on both sides of the Arctic shipping route \u2014 Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on the Kamchatka Peninsula \u2014 and invited foreign companies to invest in the reconstruction project.\n\nOther ports and infrastructure facilities along the route will also be upgraded and expanded, he said.\n\nRussia, the U.S., Canada, Denmark and Norway have all been trying to assert jurisdiction over parts of the Arctic as shrinking polar ice creates new opportunities for resource exploration and new shipping lanes.\n\nThis map released by Republican U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska in 2017 to support his amendments to national defence funding purports to show the locations of military outposts Russia has in the far north. (Office of Senator Dan Sullivan)\n\nSpeaking at the forum, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg emphasized the need to respect international law and noted that the Arctic Council provides a key arena for dialogue.\n\n\"Now and then I hear the Arctic described as a geopolitical hot spot,\" she said. \"This is not how we see it. We know the Arctic as a region of peace and stability.\"\n\nShe noted that \"this should not be taken for granted,\" adding \"it is the result of political decisions and practical co-operation between the Arctic states.\"\n\n\"Respect for international law and regional co-operation are keys to ensuring peace and stability across borders,\" Solberg said.\n\nSolberg and other leaders who spoke at the forum underlined the need for all countries in the Arctic region to focus on areas of mutual interest despite differences.\n\nRussia building up 'necessary defence capability'\n\nThe Russian military has revamped and modernized a string of Soviet-era military bases across the polar region, looking to protect its hold on the region, which is believed to hold up to one-quarter of the Earth's undiscovered oil and gas.\n\nAddressing the forum, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that military deployments in the Arctic are intended to protect national interests.\n\n\"We ensure the necessary defence capability in view of the military-political situation near our borders,\" Lavrov said, noting that a recent NATO exercise in Norway was openly directed against Russia.\n\nRussia's relations with the U.S. and other NATO allies have plummeted to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria, Moscow's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other issues.\n\nPutin used the forum to criticize U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia over its action in Ukraine, but emphasized that they wouldn't hamper the country's plans to expand its presence in the Arctic.\n\nHe charged that the U.S. has used the economic restrictions as a tool to protect its economic interests, citing Washington's opposition to a prospective pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would carry Russian gas to Germany as an example."

Nigeria already has three FPB 72s in service, which were delivered in 2012, and two FPB 98s, which were delivered in 2014.\n\nDeliveries of the new vessels are expected to take place in early 2018.\n\nThe FPB 72 is designed for coastal patrol and has a top speed of more than 30 knots. The FPB 110s will be similar to those delivered to Kuwait between 2003 and 2005 but equipped with conventional propellers rather than water jets.\n\nThe Nigerian Navy continues to expand, and in December last year commissioned 30 vessels into service including the new 95 metre long, P18N Class off-shore patrol vessel (OPV) NNS Unity, which was one of two ordered from China Shipbuilding and Offshore International Company (CSOC) in April 2012.\n\nNNS Unity, the largest of the vessels commissioned at 1 800 tons, was designed and partially built in China, while the majority of its outfitting work was done locally in Nigeria. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in December also commissioned the 39-metre long, locally built Seaward Defence Boat NNS Karaduwa and a tug which has since been named Commander Ugwu. The two vessels were built by the Nigerian Naval Shipyard in Port Harcourt.\n\nApart from the three patrol vessels, Buhari also commissioned 27 riverine patrol boats which he said would be used to secure waterways and river creeks.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing security situation is not new given the intimate connections between economic prosperity and security. For a littoral state with a huge dependence on her offshore resources, maritime security is vital to the national well-being,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe delivery of the new patrol vessels came at a time of heightened militancy and criminals activities in Nigerian rivers and in the open seas. Apart from the terrorist threat posed by Boko Haram insurgency the north-east, the Nigerian Navy is battling new militant groups that have staged disruptive attacks on oil platforms and pipeline infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidnapping, maritime robbery, human trafficking and drug smuggling are also rampant along the West African coast with over-stretched and poorly equipped regional security forces struggling to control the situation."

She is due to arrive in Nigeria in Lagos, Nigeria, on 17 April.\n\nThe two vessels, the Nguru (P187) and Ekulu (P188), completed sea trials last month. In February 2017 it emerged that Nigeria had ordered two FPB 110 Mk II coastal patrol vessels. They are 35 metres long and have a maximum speed of 30 knots. They will be fitted with two 12.7 mm machineguns and a 20 mm cannon and a 4.7 metre long Zodiac rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB). The weapons will be added in Nigeria. Other equipment includes two Furuno radars and a Vigy Observer electro-optical system.\n\nNigeria\u2019s FPB 110s are based on the models produced for Kuwait, but are driven by propellers and not water jets. They are apparently also more comfortable for the crew, with improved accommodation. The two vessels can accommodate 17 people, including a dozen crew members.\n\nThe boats are powered by two MTU 16V2000 diesel engines giving a top speed of 30 knots and a range of 900 miles with 3-5 day endurance.\n\nOnce delivered, they will be used to improve maritime security off Nigeria, with an emphasis on piracy and maritime crime.\n\nOcea has delivered a number of other vessels to Nigeria, including three 24 metre long FPB 72s in 2012 and a 32 metre FPB 98 Mk II in 2013. Five FPB 72s have been ordered, with two, the Gongola and Calabar, delivered to Nigeria in January this year after the Shiroro and Ose arrived in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother FPB 72 is expected to be delivered to Nigeria in mid-2018."

    "text": "The Armenian government will allocate 647 million dollars to defence in the 2019 budget.\n\nThis is more than 25 per cent higher than the defence budget of 2018. This is the second year in a row that the defence budget has increased, with the 2018 budget amounting to 518 million dollars, or 17 per cent larger than in 2017.\n\nWhat is the increase in military spending connected to?\n\n1.\n\nThe increase in the defence budget can be partially attributed to the growth of the Armenian economy. In 2018, the country\u2019s GDP grew by 6.5 per cent, and 5 per cent growth is forecast for 2018. In 2019, 4.5 per cent of the GDP will be spent on defence. In developed countries such as the US, the military budget is no more than 2 per cent of the GDP.\n\n2.\n\nThe decision to increase the defence expenditure is connected to a continuing arms race between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The situation on the line of contact is tense. While action does not reach levels of outright warfare, the ceasefire agreement is consistently violated.\n\n3.\n\nThe sharp increase in the defence budget of Armenia may also be connected to credit expected from the Russian Federation which would be extended to Armenia to buy new weaponry. Current information states that negotiations between Yerevan and Moscow concern a 100 million dollar credit line. Should the two sides come to an agreement, this will be the third line of credit extended by the Russian Federation to Armenia to buy weapons. Armenia has already received 300 million USD in credit from Russia.\n\nWhat weaponry does Armenia buy from Russia?\n\nArmenia buys weaponry from Russia to keep its arsenal up-to-date. In particular, Yerevan has already received Iskander tactical ballistic missiles and Smerch multiple rocket launchers.\n\nLocal media reports that Armenia may buy SU-30SM fighter aircraft. It is possible that the increase in the defence budget may also be linked to an attempt to strengthen the country\u2019s air force.\n\nIs it possible to reduce tension on the line of contact?\n\nSeveral days ago, Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev agreed to decrease tension on the line of contact and to take measures to prevent violations of the ceasefire agreement.\n\nWhether or not both sides will abide by this undertaking has yet to be seen."

Raytheon will be the prime contractor for each.\n\nThe proposed sale to Qatar, which Congress must approve, comes amid a standoff between Doha and a Saudi-led, four-nation alliance. Qatar is home to Al Udeid Air Base, which houses 10,000 U.S. personnel and serves as a crucial overseas American base.\n\nThe State Department announced Thursday it had notified Congress of the two sales. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in June, accusing the tiny but super-rich Gulf state of supporting militant groups and cozying up to Shiite, non-Arab Iran \u2014 charges Doha denies.\n\nThe State Department announcement called Qatar, \u201ca friendly country that has been, and continues to be, an important force for political stability and economic progress in the Persian Gulf region.\u201d\n\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., announced in February he would lift his eight-month hold on U.S. arms sales to Gulf Cooperation Council member states, which he levied to pressure a resolution with Qatar. At the time, he lamented the crisis between the Saudi-led bloc and Qatar was no closer to a resolution.\n\nAccording to the State department announcement, the U.S. upgrade of the Qatar Emiri Air Force\u2019s air operations center would include:\n\nOne multifunctional information distribution system low-volume terminal.\n\nGPS selective availability anti-spoofing module chips.\n\n\n\nSimple key loaders.\n\n\n\nHigh-assurance internet protocol encryptors.\n\n\n\nGround-support system components for Link 16.\n\nInfrastructure construction, integration, installation and sustainment services.\n\nCybersecurity services.\n\n\n\nTechnical and support facilities.\n\n\n\nCommunications security support.\n\n\n\nThe prime contractor, Raytheon, of Waltham, Massachusetts, is expected to assign 15 contractor representatives to Qatar, beside five government representatives.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

We have only $240 million worth and the original pricing of this aircraft for the (Bell 41) we can get 16,\" Lorenzana said.\n\n\"Initially, the Surion we can get 10 because of the money and also the Black Hawk,\" the secretary said, adding that the manufacturers of the Black Hawk changed its offer so that the Philippines could get 16 choppers.\n\nLorenzana also confirmed that the Air Force will be acquiring attack helicopters from the Turkish Aerospace Industries.\n\n\"Its name is also 'ATAK' it's an attack helicopter... I think we can only get less than 10, maybe eight,\" Lorenzana said.\n\nInternational online magazine The Diplomat earlier reported that the Philippines has identified the T129 ATAK multirole combat helicopters to address the requirements of the Philippine military.\n\nThe upcoming government-to-government deal between the Philippines and Turkey would serve as a landmark deal for the defense relationship between the two countries, according to the report.\n\nPhilippine officials, however, have yet to formally announce the deal."

Produced by Israel\u2019s ELTA, the radar systems have a 300km greater detection range than the Green Pine Block B currently possessed by the South Korean military.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe radar model was selected through competitive bidding with the Dutch company Thales,\u201d a DAPA official explained, adding that there were \u201cplans to sign a contract within the year.\u201d A budget of 330 billion won (US$292 million) is to be spent on the acquisition.\n\n\n\nA final decision was also made at the meeting on the purchase of six Poseidon (P-8A) maritime patrol aircraft produced by US company Boeing for submarine tracking.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were judged to be suitable for combat in testing, and negotiations have been completed with the US government on the price and technical conditions,\u201d A DAPA official said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe plan to sign a purchasing contract within the year,\u201d the official added.\n\n\n\nDAPA reportedly plans to acquire the Poseidon aircraft at a cost of around 210 billion won (US$186 million) each under a foreign military sales format, for which the US government provides quality assurance for a period of time when selling weapons to an ally.\n\n\n\nEquipped with AN/APY-10 radar, the Poseidon aircraft can travel at maximum speeds of 907km/h with a cruising range of 7,500km and operational radius of around 2,200km, and can be armed with Harpoon missiles and torpedoes.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

(CNA photo)\n\nTAIPEI (CNA) - Assembly of Taiwan's new advanced jet trainers (AJT) officially began Friday with a launch ceremony held at the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) in Taichung.\n\nThe AIDC, known for developing the country's indigenous Ching-kuo fighter, has been commissioned by the Ministry of National Defense to design and manufacture 66 of the advanced jet trainers, with the first prototype scheduled to be rolled out in 2019 and flight testing expected to be conducted starting in June 2020.\n\nThe advanced trainers are scheduled to be delivered by 2026 and will replace the military's AT-3 trainer aircraft and F-5 fighter jets, which are over 30 years old.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, President Tsai Ing-wen said the new trainers reflect Taiwan's goal of developing its own indigenous defense systems in an effort to enhance the combat and defense capabilities of the nation's armed forces as well as national security.\n\nThe aviation industry is part of the government's \"5 plus 2 Industrial Innovation Program\" aimed at boosting Taiwan's competitiveness, Tsai said.\n\nThe \"5 plus 2\" industries refer to seven development projects proposed by the government to transform Taiwan's economic and industrial structures. They include projects related to the biotech, green energy, aviation, smart machinery and defense industries.\n\nThis project alone has created 1,000 new jobs in the aviation industry, she went on, adding that other job opportunities are bound to arise as Taiwan continues to develop its defense industry.\n\nTaiwan must move toward the path of self-reliance in order to develop its national defense capabilities, even if it is one step at a time, Tsai said.

However, it has been a long-standing grievance of the armed forces that supply of critical spares and equipment from Russia takes a long time affecting maintenance of military systems procured from that country.\n\nIndia has been pressing Russia to adopt a liberal approach in sharing technology for components of major defence platforms as it was critical to keep them in operational readiness. Majority of India's weapon systems are of Russian origin.\n\nThe issue is understood to have figured during Sitharaman's talks with both General Shoygu and Manturov. Both sides agreed to expedite negotiations for various military platforms, the sources said.\n\nThe two countries are yet to finalise a nearly Rs 40,000-crore deal to procure S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems for the Indian armed forces mainly due to differences over price.\n\nThet are also yet to finalise a number of other deals.\n\nIndia wants procure the long-range missile systems to tighten its air defence mechanism, particularly when China has been ramping up its military manoeuvring along the nearly 4,000 km Sino-India border."

The cutting-edge frigates are also capable of carrying a Ka-27 or Ka-31 helicopter and can reach speeds of up to 30 knots (55kph).\n\nThe Russian Navy\u2019s task group operates in the eastern Mediterranean since 2012 and has seen a number of rotations, with reinforcements coming from different fleets.\n\nLast November, the group reached its peak in terms of combat capabilities when the Russian aircraft carrier \u2018Admiral Kuznetsov\u2019 arrived in the region after a weeks-long journey from its Northern Fleet\u2019s base to the Mediterranean waters.\n\nThe \u2018Kuznetsov\u2019, the Russian Navy\u2019s sole aircraft carrier, was escorted by the heavy missile cruiser \u2018Pyotr Veliky\u2019 (Peter the Great), the largest ship of her class in the world.\n\nThe naval group is taking an active part in combating Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in Syria. On Wednesday, the \u2018Admiral Essen\u2019 and submarine \u2018Krasnodar\u2019 fired four Kalibr missiles, targeting IS positions near Palmyra.\n\nREAD MORE: Russian frigate & submarine fire 4 cruise missiles at ISIS targets near Palmyra \u2013 MoD\n\nThroughout 2016, the navy conducted numerous missile launches, destroying the terrorists\u2019 manpower and materiel. In 2015, four Caspian Sea Fleet corvettes fired 26 cruise missiles on IS targets in Aleppo and Raqqa provinces.\n\nThe most spectacular launch so far involved negotiations with Iran and Iraq as the missiles had to travel through those countries\u2019 airspaces, covering 1,500km (932 miles) before hitting their targets."

    "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari recently approved $1 billion for procurement of security equipment. Many concerns were expressed about the announcement.\n\nThese included the approval of such colossal sum by the president without authorization by the National Assembly, and the rationale behind such huge expenditure to combat an organization that the government claimed had been \u201ctechnically defeated\u201d. Some were concerned that the money was simply Buhari\u2019s re-election budget masqueraded as funds for arms. Of course, the cynicism of many Nigerians stemmed from a telepathic understanding that the fund might be embezzled by an assorted selection of parasites in governments. The situation is in fact much more complex and the actors more heterogeneous.\n\nThe arms market constitutes less than one percent of global trade but contributes 50 percent of corrupt deals in the world, according to a US Department of Commerce report. One study shows that up to 15 percent of money spent on weapons were bribe payments. Such payments are technically not legal in most countries but are categorized under \u201cconsultancy fees\u201d or \u201ccommission\u201d in several others. In a country like Nigeria, averagely smart officials and their business partners will likely get away with it. Transparency International estimates bribe payments in the arms industry to be worth $20 billion per annum. Therefore, Nigeria\u2019s $1 billion extra-budgetary arms fund is a small part of a larger global oasis of corruption. Tope Oriola\n\nA study by Morris Szeftel demonstrates (and this is no comfort) that countries like Russia, France and Italy lose larger sums to defence industry corruption although such corruption on the African continent tends to be more damaging to socioeconomic development and political stability.\n\n\n\nHow will Nigeria\u2019s $1 billion arms fund be spent? We can make a number of intelligent hypotheses based on available evidence from studies on arms procurement in Africa and around the world as well as evidence from Dasukigate.\n\nFirst, the equipment will likely be bought from third parties rather than directly from manufacturers. Therefore, Nigeria will pay more per unit. Second, used weapons will likely be acquired instead of new ones. This keeps alive the carousel of corruption since we will need (earlier than usual) another budgetary allocation for the same or similar equipment. Consequently, Nigeria can expect to mint new criminal millionaires.\n\nThe latter will come from four categories of persons: A small number of top military officers, defence ministry officials, the famed \u201ccabal\u201d in the presidency and arms dealers (local and foreign).\n\nTo be fair, this is not a particularly Nigerian phenomenon.\n\nSanjeev Gupta and his colleagues have linked the phenomenon to the intense competition among arms manufacturers and dealers, which leads to willingness not to play by rules. Other factors in the scholarly literature include the fact that defense procurement is often concentrated in a small number of state officials and the market for military equipment tends to have a small number of producers and suppliers.\n\nTherefore, the arms money will be spent in a market that is far from competitive. Considering that defence spending is generally opaque, as it is treated as a matter of national security, more opportunities exist for corruption.\n\nWe may also add a small but significant detail: Many military equipment are highly technical in nature. This implies that only a small number of people \u2014 military or civilian \u2014 understand what they mean and how much they truly cost. For instance, how many officials in the Ministry of Defence or the Defence Headquarters know the difference, degree of tactility or inter-operativity of the following types of drones MQ-9 Reapers, RQ-7 Shadows, RQ-4 Global Hawk and AeroVironment Wasp IIIs? The National Assembly might be totally hopeless even if it were not dysfunctional in exercising oversight on such purchases. The equipment may be over-priced under extremely technicist and fancy names.\n\nThe analysis above presupposes that arms are actually purchased. One basic form of corruption in arms procurement is simply not buying any arms. Nigeria is one of the global leaders in this area. Recall that several former service chiefs are currently facing corruption trials. One of those is former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Mohammed Umar Dikko, facing charges of fraud amounting to approximately N9.7billion. One prosecution witness said that he \u201cpersonally\u201d gave Dikko N558.2million per month from November 2010 to September 2012, according to a statement by the EFCC.\n\n\n\nDasukigate offers insight into the penetralia of defence corruption in Nigeria. Those who shared the $2.1 billion arms fund come from an eclectic mix of backgrounds: Politics, media, military, traditional institutions and the clergy. The scandal began from the president, who seemed to have approved the funds without oversight. Categories of persons charged with receiving the arms money included 17 serving and retired senior military officers. At least 241 companies were alleged to have been involved. My analysis of a presidential statement issued on Dasukigate suggests a huge turnover in the Permanent Secretary and Director of Finance and Accounts at the Ministry of Defence.\n\nThese two positions are lucrative; Nigerians should be on the lookout vis-\u00e0-vis the new arms fund. Of the 12 indicted civil servants in Dasukigate, 10 were from the Ministry of Defence. Three of the officials from the Ministry of Defence had served as Permanent Secretaries while five had served as Directors of Finance and Accounts at the Ministry of Defence. This is no coincidence. Consequently, Dasukigate is an exemplar of what may happen to the current arms funds.\n\n\n\nHowever, let us assume that the $1 billion is truly for arms purchase. Many of the purchased equipment will have a shorter lifespan than anticipated due to poor maintenance culture. For instance, Nigeria\u2019s Aerostar drones bought from Israel in 2006 were quietly rotting away in 2014 when needed to assist with the rescue of the Chibok girls.\n\nA May 2014 Reuters report quotes an Israeli source: \u201cWe did receive an inquiry from them (i.e. Nigerian officials) about spare parts, but it never turned into a deal. I wish it had\u2026 (The drones) are probably parked in a yard somewhere\u201d. The report estimated that each drone would have cost between $15 million and $17 million. Nigeria relied on drones from the US and the UK for reconnaissance immediately after the Chibok kidnapping.\n\nNigeria would be fortunate to have 50 percent of the funds actually spent on tangible weapons and equipment. How\u2019s that possible? The bidding process is rarely open, 15 percent is routinely spent on commission, 15 to 20 percent often goes to overpricing by third party \u201csellers\u201d. State officials may also add five to ten percent in addition to the price offered by third parties. Miscellaneous or logistical spending may take up to five percent.\n\nThis includes first class or business class travel, 5-star hotel accommodation as well as estacode for some government officials. The deals are rarely concluded in a single meeting; therefore, there may be multiple travels by several officials responsible for arms purchase.\n\nYou may also add to that embezzlement of 10 to 15 percent of money designated for maintenance.\n\nMaintenance costs are usually (but not always) factored into arms deals. Consider that the March 2018 $1.076 billion arms deal between the US and Saudi Arabia included $300 million for spare parts for military vehicles and $106 million for helicopter maintenance, according to an al-Jazeera report. That was over 37 percent of the deal.\n\nEmbezzlement of maintenance budget tends to be routine in the developing world. Maintenance costs are inserted into subsequent budgets with few people aware or recalling that it had already been included in the initial purchase. Poor maintenance means restarting the process described above.\n\nThese are conservative estimates depending on the government\u2019s brigandage and complicity at the highest level. It is simple arithmetic. Nigeria would be fortunate to have real value for 50 percent of the total arms budget.\n\nIt is the nature of two beasts: The peculiarities of the defence industry as a cesspool of corruption everywhere in the world and the particularities of Nigeria, one of the world\u2019s most corrupt states with expensive elite.\n\nFollow \u2018Tope Oriola on Twitter: @topeoriola"

    "text": "While Rolls-Royce and Airbus used this week\u2019s Farnborough International Airshow to warn of the dire consequences of a hard Brexit, Britain\u2019s biggest defence firm, BAE Systems, simply shrugged its shoulders.\n\nThe business is Britain\u2019s biggest manufacturing employer, with 34,000 staff and sales of nearly \u00a320bn last year. But Brexit? \u201cIt\u2019s just not that big a deal [for us],\u201d reckons the firm that makes everything from ammunition to combat aircraft and submarines.\n\nIts statement is wildly at odds with other major firms operating in the industrial world. The European plane maker Airbus is already stockpiling parts in preparation for a no-deal Brexit, and the aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce admitted this week that it is making plans to do the same.\n\nJaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer, has warned that \u00a380bn of planned UK investment over the next five years would be at risk if Britain struck a bad Brexit deal. Meanwhile the wider UK car industry has been sounding the alarm on Brexit since well before the referendum.\n\nNot so at BAE, which says frictionless trade once the UK has left the EU would be a good thing but has otherwise kept fairly quiet despite its dominant position.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of key reasons for the apparent nonchalance: first, BAE is predominantly a UK-US company. It has little direct trade with countries in the EU, despite earnings from sales abroad totalling \u00a34.7bn.\n\nSecond, it is a low-volume producer of high-value defence kit, unlike the car companies which are high-volume manufacturers heavily reliant on just-in-time delivery of parts where holdups of just a few hours at customs could seriously disrupt production schedules.\n\nThe average UK-built car has about 6,000 parts, the majority of which come from the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Parts can pass back and forth across the Channel several times for various processes before reaching the UK.\n\nAt Airbus\u2019s factory in Broughton, north Wales, wings are built for all commercial aircraft before being transported to other Airbus factories outside the UK, including its headquarters in Toulouse, France.\n\n\u201cAs we have relatively limited trade with the EU, the resulting impact of Brexit on our business is likely to be limited, depending on the terms of any transition and final agreements,\u201d a spokeswoman for BAE said.\n\n\u201cHowever, we, like all businesses, want to see progress in the negotiations between the government and the European commission to give us all certainty,\u201d she added.\n\nBAE employs 83,200 people globally, mainly in four hubs, the only one inside the EU being the UK. In the UK it employs 34,300 people and it has no factories elsewhere in Europe. The other three hubs are in Saudi Arabia , Australia and the US \u2013 where it employs 29,100 people and which accounts for about 40% of overall business.\n\nWhen BAE won a \u00a320bn contract last month to build Australia\u2019s fleet of new navy frigates, it was seized upon by Theresa May as an example of how the UK might now build on its close relationships with allies such as Australia. But the nine new Hunter class shipswill be built in Adelaide and the 4,000 new jobs created to build the vessels will be in Australia.\n\nGuardian business email sign-up\n\nEven the Eurofighter Typhoon \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest collaborative defence programme \u2013 is basically Brexit-proof. BAE is a consortium member alongside Leonardo and a division of Airbus, and the programme is a four-partner nation deal between Germany, Spain, Italy and UK. It is therefore outside the EU.\n\nGeorge Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while it would not be right to say Brexit poses absolutely zero threat to BAE, it is clearly a lot less threatened than others.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a simple reason BAE is not forecasting the same level of disruption as others. Its main customers are the US, Saudi Arabia and the UK, with Europe only responsible for 8% of its revenues last year.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, Rolls-Royce depends on European nations for over 18% of its sales. Combine that with the comments that have come out of Airbus, a big customer of Rolls, and it\u2019s easy to see why the group would be monitoring the progress of the Brexit negotiations with interest.\u201d"

But there was the little problem of all that noise and radiation.\n\nFile this one under terrible, terrible weapons ideas of the Cold War alongside undersea bases, atomic artillery and ship-launched rocket planes.\n\nThe nuclear boat motor actually began life as airplane propulsion, if you can believe that. America\u2019s two great aircraft engine-makers, General Electric and Pratt & Whitney, both hand their fingers in this particular radioactive pie.\n\nPratt & Whitney tinkered with a closed-loop system in which the radioactive components were kept isolated from the jet exhaust. GE, however, opted for the easier-to-develop open-loop system, which led to nearly flight-ready hardware \u2026 at the regrettable cost of highly-radioactive jet exhaust.\n\nThe safety issues alone doomed the nuke jet \u2014 to say nothing of the extraordinary cost.\n\nIn 1961, after spending nearly 15 years and $1 billion \u2014 $7.7 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 the feds killed off the nuclear-powered aircraft program. But GE wasted no time looking for other uses for its designs.\n\nAbove and at top \u2014 General Electric art\n\nThe engine-maker ended up publishing a 21-volume report on the atomic motor work, and in the fullness of time these documents made their way onto the Internet. In the section entitled \u201cAPEX 910: Application Studies,\u201d you can read for yourself GE\u2019s wacky proposal to put its nuclear engine in a pod and bolt it onto a ship.\n\nIt was aerospace historian Scott Lowther who labelled GE\u2019s 601B Power Package the \u201cnuclear outboard motor\u201d \u2014 and that precisely captures its nature.\n\nIn one sleek fat, torpedo-shaped pod, GE proposed to encapsulate a nuclear reactor and a gas turbine in inert neon gas. The reactor would heat the gas which would drive the turbine as it expanded, while reduction gearing would translate the turbine\u2019s spin into propeller revolutions. The seawater surrounding the pod would act as coolant and shielding.\n\nUnlike an internal-combustion engine, the atomic outboard could run for tens of thousands of miles before needing refueling. If a malfunction demanded shutdown or scuttling of the nuclear engine, the pod could simply be jettisoned into the deep.\n\nWe are talking the late 1950s, after all. Apparently nobody worried about depositing a bunch of radioactive waste all over the ocean floor.\n\nGeneral Electric art\n\nA typical 601B power pod would be a cylindrical capsule 18 feet long, four feet in diameter and weighing 12 tons. Fueled with 250 pounds of U-235, it could produce 3,700 horsepower for over six months.\n\nLowther and atomic historian \u201cMark\u201d pointed out that, like an outboard motor, such a power pod could be attached to pretty much any seaworthy vessel \u2014 and you could easily de-nuclearize it later.\n\n\u201c[T]hese units would make dandy propulsion systems for cargo vessels,\u201d Lowther wrote. \u201cSince all of the propulsion system was in outboard pods, the ship could be nothing but a big empty cargo hold.\u201d\n\nFor military vessels, replacing the conventional engines with 601Bs could potentially double their available payload. GE\u2019s in-house artists sketched a destroyer and a submarine on patrol, each driven by whirring 601Bs. The pods would be mounted on fins or pylons attached to the same places where conventional propeller shafts go.\n\nBesides subs and destroyers, the Navy\u2019s now-retired hydrofoils were another potential application for the atomic outboard, as they already carried their motors in pods. But the thought of enduring a hydrofoil\u2019s bronco-busting ride for days on end is enough to give pause to the firmest constitution.\n\nThere was another problem. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think the drag from those pods would be pretty noisy,\u201d Mark noted. The 601Bs would have made American warships easy targets for prowling Soviet subs."

    "text": "Turkmenistan's parliament approved a budget for 2018 that is amazing -- one could even say unbelievable.\n\nAccording to the State News Agency of Turkmenistan (TDH), the 2018 budget approved on November 24 plans revenues of some 95.508 billion manats and expenses of approximately the same amount.\n\nAt Turkmenistan's official exchange rate (3.5 manats to $1), that adds up to some $27.29 billion, though at the black market rate it would be closer to $11 billion.\n\nThe expenditures for 2018 might be accurate but the forecasted revenues seem impossible.\n\n\n\nLet's break this down. But remember, Turkmen authorities have always been sparing with details about the country's economy, so there are a lot of gray areas.\n\nTurkmenistan's major export is natural gas, accounting for some 70 percent of state revenues. The price of gas has plummeted since the end of 2014, and Turkmenistan has lost two of its three significant gas customers --Iran and Russia -- leaving only China as a Turkmen gas purchaser.\n\nIn fact, China is now Turkmenistan's main trade partner, despite worrisome signs.\n\nIn January, Chinese Ambassador to Turkmenistan Sun Weidong said trade with Turkmenistan had fallen from more than $10 billion in 2013 to $5.4 billion in the first 11 months of 2016.\n\nSun said China bought just under 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas from Turkmenistan in 2016, and an earlier report from EurasiaNet put the price China pays for Turkmen gas at $185 per 1,000 cubic meters.\n\nAnd 30 bcm at $185 per 1,000 cubic meters adds up to just bit more than $5.4 billion.\n\nTurkmen gas exports to China are expected be just over 30 bcm in 2017 and that will tick up a bit more in 2018.\n\nNow, as Qishloq Ovozi and many others have noted, Turkmenistan owes China many billions of dollars for loans Turkmenistan accepted to build the gas pipelines to China in order to ship the gas from Turkmen fields that Chinese financial entities loaned Turkmenistan money to develop.\n\nIt has never been clear what percentage of Turkmen gas goes toward paying off the Chinese loans.\n\nThere is also the new debt Turkmenistan seems to be piling up from purchases of Chinese-made weapons and military equipment.\n\nA recent article noted new Chinese weapons and equipment on display at Turkmenistan's military parade during October 27 Independence Day celebrations.\n\nExpenses on the military in general have greatly increased since security in the northern Afghan provinces bordering Turkmenistan started to deteriorate in 2014.\n\nSo, Turkmenistan can count on sending China maybe $6 billion worth of gas in 2018 but actually receiving something less than that, especially considering that gas might now also being paying for Chinese military imports.\n\nIt's worth mentioning here that at least one report from February said the general director of the China National Petroleum Corporation, Den Minmin, visited Ashgabat and demanded Turkmenistan lower its gas price or else \u201cChina would be forced to reduce imports of the blue fuel.\"\n\nAccording to TDH, the budget plans for \u201csuch important branches of the production sphere as the oil, gas, and chemical industry, energy, construction, and others will make the revenue of the budget.\u201d\n\n\n\nRevenues from Turkmenistan's oil and chemical industry, energy, and construction combined would not bring in as much revenue as gas does, so we're likely still well under $10 billion.\n\nTurkmenistan does export electricity to Afghanistan and it seems it will also do so soon to Tajikistan through Uzbekistan. But this revenue is counted in the tens of millions of dollars.\n\nPast that, there's not much Turkmenistan can export to bring in any significant further revenue.\n\nIn the meantime, there are new signs Turkmenistan's economy is continuing its downward plunge.\n\nAccording to RFE/RL's Turkmen Service, known locally as Azatlyk, the black market rate as of November 29 was 9.6 Turkmen manats to $1. In January 2016, the rate was 5 manats to $1.\n\nIn October, a group of parents in the northern Dashoguz Province staged a rare protest against a decision to increase the price for children to attend kindergarten from 8 to 80 manats per month. Many parents chose to take their children out of these schools.\n\nIn response, the government told state employees they would be fired if they did not send their children to kindergarten.\n\nLater in October, farmers in the eastern Lebap Province went on strike, saying they had not been paid for picking cotton.\n\nThere was information in November that layoffs were coming to the gas-and-oil sector, two of the key sectors that are supposed to provide this $27 billion of revenue for the budget.\n\nIn the capital, Ashgabat, the rent for stores was increased by several times, forcing many of the stores to close.\n\nThe price of medicines went up by some 30 percent in November and, in Dashoguz Province, residents say there is no medicine available at all.\n\nPeople around the country are reportedly stocking up on basic foods such as flour, cooking oil, and sugar, as supplies have already started to run out and prices are rising.\n\nAnd, of course, the Turkmen government announced earlier this year it was canceling subsidies for water, gas, and electricity that had been in place since shortly after 1991 independence.\n\nTurkmenistan even seems hard-pressed to pay off seemingly small debts.\n\nAzatlyk reported on November 22 that the company CIS Debt Recovery Solutions has been after Turkmen state oil company Turkmennebit for four years to pay some $8 million Turkmennebit owes to the Cypriot company I.S. Intercomplect Ltd for equipment sold to Turkmenistan.\n\nAt the start of 2017, China complained that Turkmenistan's state gas company Turkmengaz had failed to repay some $2.5 million owed to CSR Ziyang Co. Ltd for two shunting locomotives. That debt was repaid a few weeks later.\n\nAnd no one, outside of a few people in the Turkmen government, knows how much Turkmenistan owes for the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games (AIMAG), which the country hosted in late September.\n\nThe facilities for the games were estimated to cost some $5 billion and the new airport built near Ashgabat ahead of AIMAG cost $2.3 billion.\n\nAgain, that is more than bilateral trade with China came to in 2016, at least according to Ambassador Sun.\n\nThe budget the Turkmen parliament approved is fiction, pure and simple.\n\nThere is no way Turkmenistan can take in $27 billion in revenues in 2018, and there are no new sources of income anywhere on the horizon.\n\nThis is a dangerous, delusional game, raising expectations that stand no chance of being met.\n\nAzatlyk's Toymyrat Bugaev contributed to this report.

    "text": "Company Announcement 30 July 2018 Government of Trinidad & Tobago announces future acquisition of two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats\n\nAustal Limited (Austal) (ASX:ASB) is pleased to report that the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) has announced its intention to purchase two Austal Cape Class Patrol Boats. The vessels will enhance the border protection capabilities of the country in conjunction with the existing Coast Guard fleet, and will join six Austal Fast Patrol Craft acquired in 2009.\n\nThis announcement is further to a comprehensive proposal submitted by Austal to GORTT in recent weeks. The sale is likely to be supported by the Australian Government via the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC), and follows a demonstration by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) of the capabilities of the Cape Class vessel to a delegation of senior Trinidad and Tobago officials, which included the Chief of Defence Staff.\n\nThe order is likely to be valued at circa AU$100m plus a multi-year ongoing maintenance and support package. Austal expects to establish a Service Centre in Trinidad to support these vessels, the Austal supplied Fast Patrol Craft, and any additional vessels requiring maintenance as determined by GORTT.\n\nThe new Cape Class vessels will be built in Austal\u2019s Henderson shipyard based in Western Australia. Austal have already built 10 Cape Class vessels in Henderson for the Australian Border Force and RAN. Delivery is expected to be in mid-2020.\n\nDesigned and built by Austal, the Cape Class is a 58 metre all aluminium monohull patrol boat specifically produced to combat the full range of maritime security threats. The vessel has a long 4000 nautical mile range and 28-day patrol cycle with a crew of up to 22. The vessel also supports two high speed 7.3 metre Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats used for intercepting other vessels.\n\nGORTT have requested that the purchase be supported by an EFIC finance package which will be developed specifically to support the program, for which EFIC have already supplied a letter of support. The sale of the vessels is conditional on final contracts being signed in the coming weeks, together with a conclusive offer from EFIC to GORTT. It is expected that an initial, lower value design contract will be signed shortly to hasten preparations for the main contract and ensure that the delivery schedule will be maintained.\n\nThese vessels will be the latest additions to the work already scheduled in the Henderson facility, including a 109 metre catamaran for Molslinjen of Denmark, 21 Pacific Patrol Boats (PPB), currently in build, and a 117 metre trimaran for Fred Olsen S.A. of the Canary Islands which will commence construction in August 2018. These additional build programs will keep the local workforce active at the current level until 2021 (2023 for PPB), one of the longest forward order books seen at Austal for a decade or more.\n\nConcept render of Cape Class Patrol Boat for Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard (Image: Austal)\n\n- ENDS -\n\nAustal Media Contact:\n\nContact: Gemma Whiting - Government Relations\n\nMobile: +61 (0)408 982 727\n\nEmail: gemma.whiting@austal.com"

    "text": "NEW DELHI: A mega deal to procure shoulder fired anti-aircraft missiles for the Indian Army has hit controversy after competitors alleged that a Russian system was qualified even though it failed to meet technical requirements and could not fully demonstrate capabilities during trials.The Rs 27,000 crore deal to procure Very Short Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) missiles was initiated in 2010 under the previous UPA government and has gone through several twists and turns over the years that has left the French, Swedes and Russians in the fray.Sources have told ET that after the IGLA S system was qualified in January after five years of trials by the Army, competitors have approached the defence ministry with protest letters, alleging that the system did not meet specified requirements, contending that norms have been tweaked to favour the Russians.The high value VSHORAD procurement has gone through a tricky phase since 1999, when the file was first moved to replace the Russian IGLA M systems that were being used by the Army since the 1980s. Despite the urgent requirement of a missile to take down aerial targets at a short range, the procurement process did not begin until 2010 when global tenders were floated.Out of the four respondents, the Koreans did not make it but others, including SAAB\u2019s RBS70 NG, MBDA \u2019s Mistral and the Russian IGLA S were found to be compliant to requirements in January.However, official complaints by the competitors are also being examined, given the scale of the deal. It is learnt that one point raised by competitors is that the IGLA S did not demonstrate low level target hits in desert environments during summer season and failed to lock into targets at long distance.The particular test \u2013 to intercept a target at a distance of 500 meters, travelling 10 meters above ground \u2013 is alleged to have not been passed by the Russian system in the summer season, when the hot sand makes it difficult to track incoming aircraft.It has also been alleged that the Russian side modified the sights of the IGLA S during trials by changing the optics and sensor, in a violation of rules that permit only minor alternations. And, that the Russian side did not turn up for trials ate least two times, in a violation of norms. Detailed questionnaires sent to the three competitors and the defence ministry by ET did not fetch any comments.A critical milestone for the contract will be on Friday when commercial bids are set to be opened by the defence ministry. However, it is unclear how the Army will muster the funds needed to ink a deal of such value this year, given that it is extremely short on budget In a presentation to the parliament panel on defence in March, the Army had said that the VSHORAD procurement is likely to be impacted as it has been given Rs 17, 756 crore less in the annual budget than what it had requested. The Army had also named the light specialist vehicle procurement as a project that would be impacted, however a contract is believed to have been signed now withfor the same."

Photo: Vipin Chandran\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Gifts\u2019 will pave the way for further strengthening bilateral relations, says Madivian Minister\n\n\n\nIndia on Saturday donated a second naval Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH), Dhruv, to the Maldives in a gesture that was described by Maldivian Minister for Defence Mohamed Nazim as \u201cpaving the way for further strengthening of ties between both countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nA brand new, Mark-III (the latest) variant of the India-made multi-role helicopter in Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) colours was unveiled at a simple ceremony attended by Mr. Nazim, Vice-Admiral Satish Soni, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, and MNDF Brigadier General Ali Zuhair besides senior formations from both sides, officials from the Ministry of External Affairs and representatives of the helicopter manufacturer, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, at naval air station Garuda in Kochi.\n\n\n\nCordial relation\n\n\n\nOn the last leg of his India visit, Mr. Nazim said the Maldives maintained a friendly and cordial relation with its neighbours, especially India, which stood by the nation whenever it needed support. Defence cooperation between both countries grew drastically over the past few years with Indian armed forces, particularly the Navy, contributing greatly to MNDF\u2019s capacity-building. He said the \u2018gift\u2019 would help the island nation\u2019s Coast Guard carry out search and rescue and medical evacuation from its far-flung territories.\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni said India shared long-standing ties with Maldives. While Indian Navy trained MNDF personnel and despatched its ships and aircraft to patrol the Maldivian exclusive economic zone, the Maldives contributed to security in the Indian Ocean region by enhanced surveillance and anti-piracy patrol. The nation also actively participated in forums such as the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) and the biennial exercise Milan.\n\n\n\n\n\nVice-Admiral Soni told the media later that provisioning the ALH, the face of India\u2019s aviation industry, was indicative of the importance India attached to its relationship with the island nation. While the ALH already in operation with the Maldivian Coast Guard was based at the southern Maldivian island of Addu, the more advanced, second helicopter \u2014 which also sports a weather radar\u2014 would operate from the northern Hannimadhoo Island, primarily on medical evacuation duty. The helicopter would be initially manned and maintained by an all-Indian crew.\n\n\n\nMaldives top priority\n\n\n\nThe Maldives topped India\u2019s priority alongside Bangladesh, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Defence cooperation between both countries was set for further growth, he said. As many as 16 MNDF personnel were presently undergoing training at India\u2019s Southern Naval Command, the Indian Navy\u2019s Training Command.\n\n\n\n(The Indian Navy has trained MNDF personnel since 1988. Maldivian defence personnel subscribe to at least 35 courses every year)\n\n\n\nT. Suvarna Raju, Director (Design and Development) of HAL, said the Mark-III variant of the indigenous chopper sported a digital cockpit and was capable of performing several roles.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-donates-second-naval-advanced-light-helicopter-to-maldives/article5456867.ece J'aime Je n'aime pas\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\nInvit\u00e9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSujet: Re: Maldives National Defence Force Dim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32 Sujet: Re: Maldives National Defence ForceDim 15 D\u00e9c 2013 - 16:32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLD\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW !!

In addition, a large quantity of bomb making material was also discovered.\n\n\n\nThe military had confirmed that the two rifles found in the island were from the state armoury.\n\n\n\nThe primary suspect in the weapons stash seized from the Hibilhadhoo island has, meanwhile, denied any connection to the weapons.

He has since been impeached after the ruling coalition lawmakers moved a no-confidence motion through the government controlled parliament.\n\n\n\nPresident Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom and First Lady Fathimath Ibrahim were travelling to Male from the Ibrahim Nasir International Airport (INIA), located on the nearby island of Hulhule which is a five-minute ferry ride from the capital city, on September 28 when the explosion took place.

And as the administration and our leadership has said, economic security is national security,\u201d Hooper said during the Farnborough International Airshow on July 18.\n\n\u201cSo I think the overwhelming response to these changes from our partners has been very positive. In fact, now they\u2019d like to know: \u2018How this is going to affect me, how can I take more advantage of receiving the best equipment and best capabilities from the United States?\u2019 \u201d he added.\n\nHowever, the long-tail time frame for foreign weapon sales means giving credit for this push is difficult. Some of the cases likely date back to the Obama era and were only closed this year, while others will be more recent.\n\nAnd because major defense sales, such as large tranches of planes, can single-handedly boost the dollar figures, it\u2019s hard to predict whether a bonanza is coming for U.S. defense firms. Sales totals tend to be volatile year over year, depending on what partner nations seek to buy. In FY16, sales totaled $33.6 billion, while FY15 totaled just more than $47 billion and FY14 totaled $34.2 billion.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

Throughout the show, industry members were asked if they were concerned about the impact American economic policies, including placing tariffs on traditional allies from Europe, could have on their bottom line.\n\nUS defense firms brace for damage control in wake of Trump\u2019s tough rhetoric Will the combo of President Donald Trump's tariffs and feuds with European leaders take its toll on U.S. aerospace manufacturers competing for near-term fighter jet opportunities?\n\nThe common refrain throughout the show was that industry is in a wait-and-see mode, although the commercial sector appears most concerned that expected sales of planes and rotorcraft to China could be impacted.\n\nFor his part, Hooper said that issue has not come up in his discussions at the show."

    "text": "MANILA, Philippines - The Duterte administration will earmark P140 billion to enhance the capabilities of the military next year as it grapples with the threats posed by Islamic extremists and communist rebels.\n\nPresident Duterte said the government could not achieve its development targets without paying attention to the country\u2019s internal security and public order.\n\n\u201cWe will allocate P140.4 billion to beef up the capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP),\u201d Duterte said in his message on the P3.767 trillion national budget for 2018, which was submitted to Congress on Monday.\n\nThe amount is higher by 7.5 percent than the P130.6 billion allotted for the military upgrade program this year.\n\nOf the amount, P25 billion will be allocated to the revised AFP modernization program to fund the purchase of armaments, surveillance, mobility and communications equipment.\n\nThe AFP Modernization Law was enacted in 1995 to improve the capabilities of the military. The law had a total outlay of P331.62 billion but only P63.39 billion of its budget was released. In 2012, then president Benigno Aquino III signed Republic Act 10349, which allotted P75 billion for the military\u2019s modernization program from 2013 to 2017.\n\nDuterte has promised to provide everything the military needs to fight terrorism and insurgency as well as illegal drugs.\n\nDuterte is also allocating P3.1 billion to support the Coast Guard\u2019s modernization program.\n\nHe said the outlay was meant to upgrade their capabilities to cover the country\u2019s territorial waters and coastlines.\n\nThe bulk of the budget or P922 million will be used to buy firearms and service weapons, a helicopter and a watercraft.\n\nThe government is also providing the Philippine National Police P131.5 billion to strengthen efforts against crime and illegal drugs.\n\nSome P1.4 billion will be spent to hire 10,000 new police officers to increase police visibility and to narrow the gap between the ideal police to population ratio of 1:500 from the current ratio of 1:551.\n\nThe administration is also allotting P900 million for the Oplan Double Barrel Reloaded, the government\u2019s flag ship program against illegal drugs.\n\nThe government is also providing the Philippine Statistics Authority P2 billion to roll out the biometrics-based national ID system.\n\nDuterte said the national ID system is needed to ensure that only the rightful recipients would enjoy the benefits offered by anti-poverty programs.\n\nThe government will allot P89.4 billion for the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, which is expected to benefit 4.4 million beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cWe will be strict when it comes to the eligibility requirements of the CCT and in monitoring whether or not its beneficiaries are moving out of the poverty line,\u201d Duterte said."

    "text": "India\u2019s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Sunday was able to successfully test fly its Rustom 2 at its Aeronautical Test Range at Chalakere which is situated in Chitradurga district of Karnataka.\n\nRustom 2 is a RA medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle, and has been manufactured by India, and has similarities with the the American Predator drones. Rustom 2 has very specific and athletic abilities, as it can fly for 24 hours and is also capable for long surveillance and can also keep weapons and surveillance materials. All the parameters regarding the test were normal, hence the test was branded as being successful.\n\nAs the DRDO release statement said, \u201c\u2018This flight assumes significance due to the fact that this is the first flight in user configuration with higher power engine. All parameters were normal.\u201d\n\nSecretary Department of Defence (R&D) & Chairman DRDO Dr S Christopher, Director General of Aeronautical System Dr CP Ramanarayanan, DG Electronics & Communication Systems Ms J Manjula and other scientists which had been related to the project, oversaw the flight and celebrated it\u2019s success.\n\nRustom 2 is part of the Rustom line of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that includes Rustom-I, Rustom-H and Rustom-C.\n\nThe drone was developed for use by all three services of the Indian armed forces, primarily for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) operations. The medium-altitude prototype can fly at over 22,000 ft and is a long-endurance (MALE) UAV that has an approximate flight time of 20 hours.\n\nThe drone has been modelled on the Rustom-H UCAV with a light airframe. The Rustom 2 is propelled by two 3-bladed NPO saturn engines. It stands 2.4 metres tall with a wingspan of 20.6 metres and a length of 9.5 metres. The UAV\u2019s tail section comes with a T-type vertical stabiliser and a high-mounted horizontal tailplane.\n\nIt can fly at around 280 km/h and carry a variety of payloads like Medium Range Electro Optic (MREO), Long Range Electro Optic (LREO), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communication Intelligence (COMINT) and Situational Awareness Payloads (SAP) that help in performing missions even during the night. MREO and LREO sensors are placed inside a modular payload under the nose for capturing imagery and video.\n\nThe drone\u2019s data link developed by Defence Electronics Application Laboratory transmits the ISR data to the armed forces\u2019 ground control station in realtime allowing prompt action.\n\nRustom 2 can fly missions on manual as well as autonomous modes. The onboard way-point navigation system allows the drone to conduct missions autonomously. The two NPO Saturn MT turboprop engines are fitted under the wings and produce over 450 kilogram-force thrust each.\n\nSeveral critical systems and components of the drone, like its airframe, avionics sub-systems, flight control, landing gear etc have been made indigenously and some in collaboration with private manufacturers.\n\nSources: Various"

    "text": "Alexandria Shipyard has launched the first locally built Gowind corvette, ENS Port Said, which is the first modern warship to be built in Egypt.\n\nThe vessel (976) was launched during a ceremony in Alexandria on 6 September.\n\nIn 2014 the Egyptian Navy ordered four Gowind 2500 corvettes for around 1 billion euros from France\u2019s Naval Group (formerly DCNS), with one, El Fateh built in Lorient and the other three being built in Egypt. El Fateh was delivered to Egypt in October 2017.\n\n\u201cNaval Group is proud to be present at the launching ceremony and to celebrate the strength of the long-term partnership with the Egyptian Navy. To deepen this commitment, Naval Group created the subsidiary Alexandria Naval for Maintenance and Industry in June 2018,\u201d the Group said.\n\nAlexandria Shipyard cut the first steel for ENS Port Said in April 2016 and is busy with the third vessel, with a large portion of its bottom structure almost complete. In July, Naval Group shipped the sensor mast for the third vessel.\n\nThe Gowind design selected by Egypt is fitted with the Naval Group\u2019s SETIS combat management system including Panoramic Sensors and Intelligence Module (PSIM). A panoramic bridge offers 360\u00b0 visibility and a single enclosed mast offers 360\u00b0 sensor visibility. The mast integrates the SETIS combat management system as well as most sensors of the Gowind corvette including SMART-S radar and electronic warfare equipment (including Sylena decoy launchers).\n\nEgypt\u2019s vessels will be equipped with 16 VL-MICA surface-to-air missiles and eight Exocet MM40 surface-to-surface missiles as well as one 76 mm and two 20 mm guns. The vessels can each carry one medium helicopter (such as the Eurocopter EC 725 Cougar) and will be fitted with torpedo launchers. Sensors include a Kingklip sonar and Captas 2 towed sonar.\n\nThe Egyptian Gowind 2500 has a total length of 102 metres, a width of 16 metres, displacement of 2600 tonnes and a maximum speed of 25 knots. Range at 15 knots is 3 700 nautical miles. Including a helicopter detachment, crew is 65 persons.\n\nEgypt was in talks with France to acquire another two Gowind corvettes, but apparently talks stalled over cost concerns. If ordered, they would be produced by France in Lorient. It has been reported that Egypt is now looking to Germany\u2019s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) to supply two Meko A200 corvettes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort Said is the fifth vessel designed for Egypt by France\u2019s Naval Group, after the FREMM frigate ENS Tahya Misr (1001), the landing helicopter docks ENS Gamal Abdel Nasser (L1010) and ENS Anwar El Sadat (L1020) and the first Gowind corvette ENS El Fateh (971)."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Combined weapon sales from American companies for fiscal 2018 were up 13 percent over fiscal 2017 figures, netting American firms $192.3 billion, according to new numbers released Thursday by the State Department.\n\nThe department previously announced that FY18 brought in $55.66 billion in foreign military sales, an uptick of 33 percent over FY17\u2019s $41.93 billion. Through the Foreign Military Sales process, the U.S. government serves as a go-between for foreign partners and American industry.\n\nWhat had not been released until now is the total direct commercial sales, the process through which foreign customers can directly buy systems from industry. Those figures topped $136.6 billion for FY18, a 6.6 percent increase from FY17\u2019s $128.1 billion.\n\nThe Trump administration has made selling American defense goods abroad a key plank of its governance plan, under the guiding principal that \u201ceconomic security is national security.\u201d Earlier this year, the department rolled out its new Conventional Arms Transfer policy, or CAT, as well as new guidance for selling unmanned systems, with the explicit goal of increasing arms sales.\n\nState official predicts US weapon sales increase in 2019 U.S. firms could be poised for a bonanza of weapon sales in FY 2019.\n\nHowever, tying this year\u2019s figures to the CAT changes may be a stretch. Sales can fluctuate year by year because of the size of certain weapons packages; a pair of large Saudi Arabian purchases in 2012 famously set that year up for a massive $287 billion annual total.\n\nAnd there has already been steady growth each of the last three years, even before the Trump administration\u2019s reforms kicked in, with $148.6 billion in total sales in FY16; $170 billion in FY17; and $192.2 billion in FY18.\n\nA State Department official, speaking on background ahead of the official release of these figures, acknowledged to Defense News that these figures can\u2019t be tied directly to changes in policy, noting they represent a \u201cdynamic picture\u201d and that the department is aware there are some factors \u201cwe do not control.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out? Sign up for the Early Bird Brief, the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information, straight to your inbox. Thanks for signing up. By giving us your email, you are opting in to the Early Bird Brief.\n\nStill, the official expressed confidence that as the CAT policy is enacted, it will lead to a natural growth in sales. How much, however, is hard to nail down.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speculate on a particular goal that we\u2019re looking at\u201d for FY19, the official said. \u201cWe think a 13 percent increase is a significant increase year over year. We\u2019d like to maintain that pace, but there are other factors that go into a given set of annual numbers, so I\u2019m hesitant to give a target goal.\u201d\n\nThanks to both the CAT changes and export reform efforts beginning under the Obama administration, there are more options for countries to use direct commercial sales, or DCS, for their procurements.\n\nAsked if that meant DCS might grow as FMS cases drop, the official said that is \u201cone dynamic\u201d under review, but noted that \u201cas certain systems start going through DCS, you\u2019ll have new systems backfilling the FMS queue.\u201d"

    "text": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nIndia\u2019s showcase expo for the defence sector looks likely to be a dud this time, with last-minute change of venues and dates one of the key reasons.\n\nEvery two years, India hosts its showcase exposition for the defence industry. Being the largest weapons importer in the world, the event \u2013 innovatively named DefExpo India \u2013 generates significant interest from around the world.\n\nFrom tank manufacturers in Russia to shipyards in Korea, assault rifle developers in Eastern Europe to global defence giants from the US and Europe, DefExpo is the place to be for meeting government officials, networking with Indian companies, and pitching the latest in destruction to the Indian armed forces.\n\nTraditionally held in the national capital, where it is easiest for government officials to attend, the event was moved to Goa in 2016, when Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister. This time around, the event has found its way to Kanchipuram district in Nirmala Sitharaman\u2019s home state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nWhile the district is famous around the world for its silk saris, the Kanchipuram edition in April might not fetch the global interest that similar shows in the past have seen. In fact, several defence manufacturers and industry groups are predicting it to be a dud \u2013 not least due to the last-minute change of the venue from Goa to Tamil Nadu and a change of dates, which has thrown advance planning out of gear.\n\nLogistics\n\nThe mystery over the change of dates \u2013 the event is usually held in February-March \u2013 has remained unresolved. In December, it was \u2018confirmed\u2019 to global companies that the event would be held in Goa in February, prompting most to make travel and accommodation arrangements. Bookings were even made for stalls and exhibition space.\n\nHowever, on 18 January, Sitharaman announced a change of venue during an event in Chennai \u2013 to a temple complex in Kanchipuram district, south of Chennai on the East Coast Road. The logistics required to set up a venue from scratch at a completely new place are daunting to say the least.\n\nLow interest\n\nThe defence ministry, in a series of press releases, has claimed a \u2018tremendous response\u2019 to the event, saying the interest has been \u2018overwhelming\u2019 from both foreign countries and domestic defence industries.\n\n\u201cForty-two countries have already confirmed their participation and the number is expected to grow in the coming days. The countries who have confirmed participation include major defence manufacturing nations like USA, UK, Russia, France, Israel, Korea, Sweden, among others,\u201d an official release said.\n\nHowever, independent chats with global and Indian companies reveal that either delegations are being pruned or exhibition spaces will be shrunk this year. The official government website that tracks companies registered for the show also records just 325 companies confirmed for the show. Russia and France are currently the top participants with 19 companies each set to feature.\n\nThis, however, will be a far cry from the 2016 edition, where according to an official defence ministry release, over 1,000 companies participated, 490 of them from abroad. The release also says that 204 official delegations from overseas attended the show, making it India\u2019s largest ever defence expo.\n\nBusiness is bad\n\nA reason for the low interest from Indian companies this time is simple \u2014 business is bad. No large orders are in the pipeline for the private sector, discouraging a large set of small and medium enterprises that had set up shop at the 2016 show, hoping to ride the wave of a boom in the defence manufacturing sector.\n\nHowever as the past two years have shown, private companies have not been able to cash in on the sector. The recent report by junior defence minister Subhash Bhamre to the PMO has stated this problem in clear terms, blaming a lack of decision-making and bureaucratic processes for a failure to unlock Make in India in the sector.\n\nThe lacklustre defence budget \u2013 ThePrint brought out how the Air Force\u2019s allocation does not even make up for committed liabilities \u2013 has added to the disappointment.\n\nOther than the Rafale deal, it is a fact that not a single major defence contract that was initiated by the NDA government after it came to power in 2014 has actually been awarded to the winner. Deals that have been signed were either legacy \u2013 like the Chinook and Apache helicopter purchases \u2013 or have been handed over as nominations to the public sector.\n\nPSUs\u2019 plans\n\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that the DefExpo this time seems to be heading for a bailout from public sector units, the biggest beneficiary of the defence ministry\u2019s generosity over the past four years.\n\nThe theme for the expo this time is \u2018India: The Emerging Defence Manufacturing Hub\u2019. The mega plans for the event is to showcase weapon systems largely made by PSUs or developed by the DRDO.\n\nFrom Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd\u2019s flying platforms like the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Advanced Light Helicopter to the 155 mm Advanced Towed Artillery Gun (ATAG) and Arjun Tank, the show would see a range of Indian-made systems on display. In addition, naval shipyards will exhibit capabilities in manufacturing and servicing ships.\n\nWhile intense efforts are on to \u2018encourage\u2019 participation at the event in all manners possible, signs are certainly pointing at the DefExpo being a dud. A final verdict would be available in a fortnight or so, when final registrations for the event close down.\n\nSubscribe to our channels on YouTube & Telegram"

    "text": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2013 The Marine Corps is moving to integrate the Naval Strike Missile with its own forces as the service is pushing into a new era of island-hopping warfare.\n\nThis week, Raytheon was given a $47-million award to integrate the Naval Strike Missile into the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 \u201cexisting force structure,\u201d according to an announcement from the company on the other transaction authority (OTA).\n\n\u201cThis fifth-generation missile adds another dimension for sea control operations and for protection from adversary warships,\u201d Kim Ernzen, vice president of Raytheon Air Warfare Systems, said in a statement.\n\nThe selection of the subsonic anti-ship missile by the Marine Corps follows the Navy, which plans to field the NSMs later this year on a deployment of Littoral Combat Ships to the Pacific.\n\n\u201cThe Marine Corps\u2019 selection of the Navy\u2019s anti-ship missile enhances joint interoperability and reduces costs and logistical burdens,\u201d reads the Raytheon statement.\n\nWhile Randy Kempton, Raytheon\u2019s NSM program director, would not specify what platforms the Marines would use to deploy the missile, NSM designer Kongsberg has been working with Lockheed Martin to field an air-launched version of the missile on Norwegian and Australian F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighters.\n\nEarlier this year, Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller told USNI News the Marines were interested in fielding a land-based anti-ship missiles as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ground component to the maritime fight. We\u2019re a naval force in a naval campaign; you have to help the ships control sea space. And you can do that from the land,\u201d Neller told USNI News in February.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to attack surface platforms at range, and so that\u2019s what the capability requirement is.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Army fired an NSM at a decommissioned ship from a ground vehicle as part of a demonstration during the 2018 Rim of the Pacific exercise. The Marines have also experimented firing rounds from M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) at targets from sea, though it is unclear if the system could field the NSM.\n\nThe service is in the process of developing its piece of the Pentagon\u2019s push into a new era of high-end warfare with the island-hopping Expeditionary Advance Base Operations concept."

However, it has only been in the past year that the U.S. has begun shipping lethal military aid to the country, where sporadic clashes continue between government security forces and the militants.\n\nIn 2018, Washington began stepping up its support to Ukraine by providing military equipment, such as anti-tank Javelin missiles. In September, the U.S. Coast Guard transferred two Island-class cutters, armed with .50-caliber machine guns and 25 mm deck guns, to Ukraine to bolster the country\u2019s small navy.\n\nTensions with Russia sparked around the Black Sea in November when the Russian coast guard fired upon and seized three Ukrainian ships that were attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait to the Sea of Azov.\n\nIn the months since the incident, the U.S. has called on allies to demonstrate more support for Ukraine. In April, NATO members responded with an agreement to expand their presence in the Black Sea by conducting more port visits. The agreement also focused on improving NATO\u2019s \u201csituational awareness\u201d in the region and stepping up maritime forces training.\n\nThe new funds also will aim to improve the Ukrainian navy and naval infantry\u2019s \u201cmaritime situational awareness and operations,\u201d the Pentagon said.\n\nOther areas of focus are improving the \u201csurvivability\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s ground and special operations forces with counter-artillery radars, electronic warfare detection equipment and help ensuring secure lines of communication.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92019 the Stars and Stripes\n\nVisit the Stars and Stripes at www.stripes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Russia is currently unable to find a source for the critical carbon fiber components needed to make one of its hypersonic weapons, despite President Vladimir Putin's claims that the device has already entered serial production, according to people with direct knowledge of a U.S. intelligence report. A hypersonic weapon can travel at least five times the speed of sound, or about one mile per second. What's more, the U.S. is currently unable to defend against this breed of threat. The Kremlin considers their current carbon fiber material unreliable and is therefore looking for another source. Yet, the people added, Moscow has prioritized the program, and so the weapon is still on track to achieve initial operational capability by 2020. The next flight test is slated for December, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"The body of the hypersonic glide vehicle cannot withstand the heat on re-entry, and therefore the internal systems fail,\" this person explained to CNBC. \"The Russians therefore need a better material because they have an upcoming test and they don't think the material used to construct the body provides enough thermal protection.\"\n\nRussia expects the carbon fiber components to be produced within 12 months of selection and still expects to meet its 2020 deadline, according to the person. \"It's intriguing that they continue to run into problems, because they've been flight-testing this system for a long time,\" said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. \"They're running into the same problems that anyone else would run into if they would do this, and it gets back to the issue, of course, how important is this for Russia?\" he added, noting Moscow's ambition to develop hypersonic weapons. Read more: Hypersonic weapons: What they are, and why the U.S. can't defend against them A spokesman for the Pentagon expressed skepticism about Russia's hypersonic development. \"Obviously, Russian attempts to develop high-tech weaponry is something we watch closely. To this point, however, we've seen more grandiose claims of success than actual proof,\" said Defense Department spokesman Eric Pahon. \"We are continuing to develop our own defensive capabilities and improve readiness for both ourselves and our allies to counter any threats the Russians may develop.\" The latest revelations come less than eight months after Putin touted his nation's growing hypersonic arsenal as \"invincible.\" The hypersonic glide vehicle, dubbed Avangard, was one of the six weapons Putin presented in March. Avangard is designed to sit atop an intercontinental ballistic missile and uses aerodynamic forces to sail on top of the atmosphere. Putin claimed Avangard was capable of reaching targets at a speed of 20 times the speed of sound and strikes \"like a fireball.\" He also said that the hypersonic warhead had already entered serial production. \"Certainly, heat management is a huge challenge; you know, you have this thing that is going through the atmosphere at very high speeds and potentially for a long period of time,\" said James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The longer you are in the atmosphere, the more heat you have to manage, and that's been a huge challenge for the U.S. in hypersonics, and, in part, it's really a material science challenge,\" Acton added, noting the significant costs associated with testing and producing hypersonic weapons.\n\nA display of a flight of the warhead of the Avangard hypersonic boost-glide weapon.

Some of the UAVs and three helicopters are supposed to arrive in November this year.\n\nNigerian media report that the Yabhon Flash-20 UAVs will replace the CH-3 armed UAVs acquired from China. One crashed in January 2015 and the type has apparently been problematic in Nigerian service. They have been armed with AR-1 missiles, and used to strike Boko Haram positions.\n\nThe Yabhon Flash 20 is the smallest of Adcom Systems\u2019 UAVs at about 1.5 tonnes maximum take-off weight. It can fly for 60-70 hours and carries a gimbaled camera platform.\n\nNigeria also has Aerostar UAVs and some indigenous designs in service such as the Gulma.\n\nSource: Defence Web"

The United States has since early 2000s listed Abu Sayyaf and the NPA as terrorist organizations.\n\nState Prosecutor Peter Ong said the rebels are \u201cmerely buying time by deceiving the Philippine government in entering into peace talks\u201d because their main agenda was to overthrow the duly constituted authorities.\n\nDuterte is particularly aggrieved by the failure of a peace process that he made a priority and restarted in August 2016 within a few weeks of taking office. He freed some communist leaders from jail and gave cabinet posts to several known leftists as a show of good faith.\n\nThe petition comes on the same day Duterte is set to host a dinner for a group of dozens of former NPA guerrillas who surrendered. Most of the former rebels have not been to the capital and were given tour of parks and malls.\n\nMore than 40,000 people had died in the Maoist rebellion waged by about 3,000 guerrillas for nearly 50 years, attacking mines, plantations, public infrastructure projects and remote army and police outposts in poor rural areas.\n\nThe on-again, off-again negotiations with The Netherlands-based exiled rebel leaders, which started in 1986, were brokered by Norway."

The unmanned air vehicles are expected to be completed by 31 March 2020, according to a US Defense Department contract notice online.\n\nThe US State Department approved the sale of four MQ-5 Block 5 Reapers to Spain for $243 million in 2015. That deal would have included 20 embedded global positioning system and inertial guidance units, two mobile ground control stations, five multi-spectral targeting systems and five synthetic aperture radars. Also proposed was contractor logistics support for two years and personnel training, as well as aircraft components, spares and accessories.\n\nAt the time, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Security Cooperation Agency determined the sale would enhance the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability of the Spanish military.\n\n\u201cCommonality of ISR capabilities increases interoperability between US and Spanish forces and provides a common interface with other MQ-9 NATO operators, including the United Kingdom, France and Italy,\u201d said the agency\u2019s notice. \u201cThe Spanish Air Force intends to use the MQ-9s for homeland security, peacekeeping, peace enforcement, counterinsurgency, and counterterrorism operations.

    "text": "The Togolese Air Force appears not to have taken delivery of an ex-Botswana Defence Force CASA CN235M transport aircraft, as previously indicated.\n\nIn August last year it was reported that the CN235 was destined for Togo as it was seen in Togolese Air Force markings at Lanseria airport in July, after undergoing maintenance in Johannesburg. On July 11 it was cancelled from the US register upon transfer to Togo.\n\nHowever, last week Air Forces Daily reported that the sale may have fallen through as the aircraft remained at Lanseria until at least January this year. Then, on August 5, it was registered in the United States as N124CL to Avcorp US Registrations LLC Trustee of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nThe aircraft is one of two ex-Botswana Defence Force Air Wing CN235s that were retired after being replaced with new production CN235M-300s from December 2009. Botswana was the second African customer for the CN235 and received its two examples in 1987-88. The older aircraft were subsequently placed in storage at Lanseria.\n\nThe second example was registered with Fayard Enterprises of Wake Forest, North Carolina. This company primarily provides skydiving operations with aircraft and aircraft maintenance services. The aircraft was then sold through Skywest International LLC to Paramount Logistics Corporation under a contract announced on June 5, 2012. It was removed from the US register on May 25, 2012, as it was sold in South Africa.\n\nAir Forces Daily reports that in January this year it was painted as TN-228 for the Congolese Air Force. It has presumably been delivered to Brazzaville.\n\nCongo-Brazzaville has a very small air force geared towards providing transport, especially to the president and government ministers, according to Jane\u2019s Sentinel Security Assessment. Janes adds that since 1997, the air force has \u201ceffectively ceased to exist as a viable and effective military organisation. Even before the civil war, most types had been withdrawn from service.\u201d\n\nThe Congolese Air Force\u2019s only combat capable aircraft are two ex-South African Air Force Mirage F1s acquired several years ago after being refurbished by the Paramount Group (the Air Force\u2019s dozen MiG-21s are all grounded).\n\nThe Congolese Air Force has a motley collection of transport aircraft and helicopters. These include an An-12, five An-24s, one An-26, a Boeing 727, one Fokker F-28 and an N-2501 Noratlas, according to the IISS\u2019s The Military Balance 2012.\n\nOnly a few helicopters are in flying condition, including a Mi-26, AS 365 Dauphin, SA 316 Alouette III and SA 318 Alouette II. Other aircraft in the Congo\u2019s inventory include four L-39 Albatros jets. A number of Mi-8/17s may also be in service.\n\nThe CN235 is able to carry up to six tonnes of payload. Its two General Electric GE CT7-9C3 turboprop engines, each delivering 1 870 shp, give it a maximum cruise speed of 240 kt (450 km/h). CN235s have accumulated more than a million flight hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameroon became the most recent CN235 operator when it received a single example last month. Its CN235 was the 276th to be ordered from Airbus Military. A total of 43 operators around the world have ordered the aircraft in transport and surveillance versions, and it is currently in service with 28 countries."

    "text": "The United States and Europe are on the verge of losing the Turkish public to Russia. Since November 2016, when reports appeared of Turkey\u2019s decision to purchase S-400 Triumph air defense systems from Russia, Moscow has been trying hard to win the hearts and minds of the Turkish people.\n\nRussia has never deviated from this objective despite major crises in the military/security arenas with Turkey, such as the assassination of Russia\u2019s ambassador in Ankara, Andrei Karlov, by a Turkish police officer in December 2016; embargoes on Turkish agricultural product exports to Russia; and the mistaken killing of three Turkish soldiers by a Russian plane Feb. 9 during Operation Euphrates Shield in Syria.\n\nA study of news, comments and analyses in Turkish social and conventional media since October, when the debate on the S-400 became a hot public topic, clearly shows Russia has taken steps to improve its strategy to alter the perceptions and thinking of the Turkish public.\n\nIt's unlikely that Turkey would deploy the S-400 before 2020, and there are still serious outstanding issues, such as financing and technology transfer, so it is too early to declare a done deal. Moscow, however, persists in disseminating reports designed to manipulate and extend coverage of the deal.\n\nSince November 2016, I have been emphasizing that for Moscow, the actual deployment of S-400s in Turkey is not of paramount importance, but the process is. So Russia is happy to spread out news of the $2.5 billion deal over time.\n\nRussia is trying to make sure the S-400 story continues to erode Turkey\u2019s traditional NATO-centric orientation and fortify the Turkish public\u2019s opinion that Russia is its most dependable ally; ensure Moscow a chance to create a structural crisis between Turkey and the Western security bloc; and advertise its weapons systems to facilitate its military presence in the Middle East. Moscow is negotiating with Saudi Arabia and Egypt and also has initiated negotiations with Morocco for the S-400.\n\nTurkey, which had sensed a military threat from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, joined NATO and formed a barrier to the Soviet threat to the alliance\u2019s southeast. Ankara is now, paradoxically, opening the way for Russian military presence in the region by keeping the S-400 debate alive.\n\nThe Turkish media almost daily carry reports that Turkey and Russia have entered intensive cooperation in the defense industry/security field. Just recently, there were many reports of Turkish Aerospace Industries signing a strategic cooperation and partnership memorandum of understanding with the Russian company Irkut at the Dubai Air Show, which took place Nov. 12-16.\n\nNihat Ali Ozcan, a consultant with the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey, believes Russia is indeed laying the groundwork to recast the Turkish public\u2019s perception of the United States, the European Union and NATO. \"No wonder we are overwhelmed with Russian-origin news, some factual and some manufactured according to the need of the day,\" he told Al-Monitor.\n\n\"Putin\u2019s team is competent \u2014 not a bunch of pompous imbeciles \u2014 and under the management of a former intelligence man and [with] a wisely designed strategy,\" he added. Ozcan, an academic and retired major with the Turkish armed forces, underlines that the West's contradictory policies and populist narratives against Turkey are also driving the Turkish public toward Russia.\n\nMy personal opinions match those of Ozcan and are backed by the results of a poll, \u201cTurkey\u2019s Foreign Policy: Research on Public Perceptions,\" released by Kadir Has University in July. The poll showed \u201ccombating terror\u201d was seen by 44.2% of respondents as the biggest problem for Turkish foreign policy. The Syrian war was second, with 24.6%.\n\nMoscow, which is aware of these two sensitivities, skillfully paints the United States as the leading threat in terror and on Syria issues, while managing to keep a low profile in the media regarding its own relations with the Kurdistan Workers Party and its supposed Syrian offshoot, the Democratic Union Party \u2014 both of which Turkey considers terrorist groups. In this annual poll, one striking finding was that the percentage of the Turkish public that perceives Russia as a threat dropped from 34.9% in 2016 to 18.5% in 2017.\n\nLast year, poll respondents said Middle Eastern countries posed the biggest threat to Turkey, but this year, 66.5% said the United States is the worst threat to Turkey, up from 44.1% a year before. Last year, only 14.8% thought that strategic cooperation with Russia could be an alternative to EU membership. This year, that figure reached 27.6%.\n\nAll told, the poll presents us with this hard fact: While Russia\u2019s image in Turkish public opinion in 2017 was rapidly improving, the images of the United States and European countries were deteriorating.\n\nI've frequently been hearing in Ankara an increasing dose of \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for Turkey to withdraw from the military wing of NATO?\u201d If these whispers gain traction and Turkey\u2019s ties to the Western security bloc weaken, it is likely that calls for Turkey to leave the military wing, if not NATO itself, will intensify.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see if Moscow can degrade Ankara\u2019s trans-Atlantic ties by focusing on the process and not the outcome of the $2.5 billion S-400 deal. I think the stances of others, not Ankara, will provide the answer.\n\nThen my question to the others will be: How ready are you for the geostrategic and geoeconomic costs of losing Turkey?"

In addition to being a boost for bilateral ties, the move is part of commemorations under way marking 25 years of partnership between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\n\nAs I have noted before, the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attempted to signal a more action-oriented policy towards ASEAN specifically and East Asia more generally through its Act East Policy, in contrast to India\u2019s original Look East Policy first formulated under Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in the 1990s (See: \u201cModi Unveils India\u2019s Act East Policy to ASEAN\u201d).\n\n2017 is an especially significant year for ASEAN-India relations, since it marks the 25th anniversary of India\u2019s partnership with ASEAN. Though cultural ties data back over two millenia, India formally became a sectoral dialogue partner of ASEAN on January 28, 1992, after which both sides became full dialogue partners in 1996, summit partners in 2002, and strategic partners in 2012. As such, a series of events have been planned thoughout 2017 as it is a key commemorative year.\n\nIn early September, as part of the commemorations for the 25th anniversary, the Indian defense ministry disclosed that two Indian Navy ships would proceed on a three-month deployment to East and Southeast Asia covering 12 ports after leaving the Indian port of Visakhapatnam on September 8.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

The ships were scheduled for a range of activities in Southeast Asian states, from regular port visits to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercise in Malaysia.\n\nEnjoying this article?

The INS Satpura and the INS Kadmatt, he said, would be docking t Pier 15 in Manila\u2019s South Harbor.\n\nLincuna did not provide much detail on the specifics of the goodwill visit beyond this. But he did disclose that the warships would meet the BRP Rajah Humabon off Corregidor before being escorted to their berths as is customary. He also framed the visit as an attempt to both boost bilateral ties as well as to commemorate ASEAN-India relations."

    "text": "Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan\u2019s national budget for the 2017/18 financial year sees defence and public safety getting R198.7 billion to ensure South Africa\u2019s territorial sovereignty is maintained as well as keeping South Africans safe \u2013 a Constitutionally set imperative for both the national defence force and the police service.\n\nThe bulk of the allocation \u2013 R93.5 billion or 47.2% goes to what National Treasury calls \u201cpolice services\u201d. Defence and state security, in the form of the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) and its managing arm the Department of Defence (DoD) along with Minister David Mahlobo\u2019s State Security Agency gets R54 billion (27.2%).\n\nLaw courts and prisons have a 22% (R42.8 billion) share of the national defence and public safety budget with home affairs receiving the balance of R7.2 billion (3.6%), some of which will presumably be spent on the Border Management Agency, which indications are will become operational in the 2017/18 financial year.\n\nThe Estimates of National Expenditure (ENE) show the DoD/SANDF as being on the receiving end of R48 618 million for the 2017/18 financial year to \u201cdefend and protect the Republic of South Africa, its territorial integrity and its peoples\u201d.\n\nThis is an increase of just under R1.5 billion on the 2016/17 budget and is well below the inflation rate currently standing at six percent plus.\n\nThe ENE points out that over the medium term the DoD will spend almost 80% of its budget on \u201ccompensation of employees and related goods and services as the DoD\u2019s core activities are labour intensive\u201d.\n\nIn line with an overall government commitment to decreasing and containing costs the ENE notes that wages and salaries will be reduced by R1.9 billion in the current financial year and even more to R2.9 billion in the 2018/19 financial cycle. This follows a Cabinet decision to lower the national aggregate expenditure ceiling.\n\nThe small increase in overall funding to the country\u2019s military means there will not be an increase in the number of personnel deployed on border protection duties. Operation Corona will continue to have 15 companies for the 2017/18 financial year. The number of defence attach\u00e9 offices will also remain at 44 as part of cost savings.\n\nThe long-awaited naval acquisitions of in- and offshore patrol vessels are still on hold, notwithstanding Armscor having announced preferred bidders earlier this month. According to Treasury the patrol vessel acquisitions have been deferred to the 2018/19 financial cycle with the replacement hydrographic vessel acquisition approved for the current financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SA Air Force\u2019s plans to acquire medium and light transport aircraft in the maritime and transport category, precision-guided ammunition and new generation mobile communications is also on hold. According to the ENEs this will take place in 2019/20 and see an amount of R1.4 billion spent on the airborne arm of the SANDF.\n\n"

The supply of these Russian weapons is expected for this year.\n\n\n\nMobile launcher unit TEL Transporter Erector Launcher of S-300PS air defense missile system at military parade in Armenia (Picture source Armenian MoD)\n\nThe agreement on the loan for Armenia to buy Russian weapons was signed on October 24, 2017. The loan was provided with a 3% annual interest. In June 2015, Russia signed an agreement with Armenia on a state export loan worth $200 mln to finance deliveries of Russian weapons. The loan maturity was 13 years with a three-year grace period and a 3% annual interest rate.\n\nDrozhzhov said Russia and Uzbekistan have inked a contract to deliver more than 10 Mi-35 helicopters. \"We signed a contract for Mi-35 helicopters. The work is successful, and military-technical cooperation with Uzbekistan is actively developing,\" he said.\n\nDrozhzhov said \"over ten craft\" will be supplied. A diplomatic source earlier told TASS 12 Mi-35 helicopters have to be delivered. Drozhzhov said Russia hopes to ink a deal to deliver S-400 antiaircraft missiles to India in 2018.\n\nIn January, Rostec CEO Sergey Chemezov said in an interview published on the Indian Defense News portal that negotiations for the contract entered the advanced stage and the parties were discussing technical details. In October 2016, the states inked an intergovernmental agreement on deliveries of the weapons.\n\nThe contract for the delivery of MiG-35 fighter jets to Kazakhstan has not been inked yet. \"Work is ongoing but so far there are no contracted commitments,\" Drozhzhov said. He added it was too early to speak about a possible creation of a joint Russian-Kazakh venture to produce MiG-35 in the country.\n\nThe MiG Corporation earlier said Kazakhstan can become a major buyer of the new fighter jet. An agreement was signed at MAKS-2017 airshow between MiG and Kazakhstan Engineering on the promotion of MiG-35 in Kazakhstan and the creation of servicing and production facilities to localize the production of units of the aircraft.\n\n\n\nSince 2010 and according to the SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) arms trade database, Armenia has taken delivery of many military equipment from Russia including two S-300PS/SA-10C air defense missile systems, 10 armoured vehicle Tigr, 400 MANPADS Igla-S/SA-24, 25 Iskander ballistic missile, 6 BM-30 9A52 Smerch MLRS 300mm Multiple Launch Rocket system, 200 Verba SA-25, and undisclosed number of anti-tank missiles 9M133 Kornet/AT-14."

    "text": "Author: Chitrapu Uday Bhaskar, New Delhi\n\nChina and India have a complex and prickly relationship: a consequence of geography, history and recent experiences between the two.\n\nAn unresolved territorial and border dispute led to a brief war between the two countries in October 1962, and the humiliation of India in that confrontation remains part of its collective national memory. This reality shapes India\u2019s response to China\u2019s increasing influence and power in the region today.\n\nWhen it comes to assessing national power, the differing trajectories of Chinese and Indian GDP since 1960 and the current disparity between them is quite stark. In 1960, China\u2019s GDP was half that of India\u2019s. In 2017, China\u2019s nominal GDP is estimated to be US$11.8 trillion, while India\u2019s is closer to US$2.45 trillion. China has successfully \u2018risen\u2019 and some expect it to displace the United States as \u2018number one\u2019 within a decade.\n\nDespite this, democratic India remains the intangible challenge in Asia for Beijing.\n\nIndia\u2019s efforts at enabling the birth of Bangladesh in December 1971 stoked a deep anxiety in China, and Beijing came to the conclusion that India had to be contained within the subcontinent and kept in a state of extended disequilibrium.\n\nThis geopolitical template provides the context for the strategic partnership that China has maintained with Pakistan since the early 1970s. Beijing has used its comprehensive economic and military capability to enhance its footprint in India\u2019s neighbourhood, including in Bangladesh, and most recently the Maldives. Most of these states have become heavily dependent on China rather than India for their economic and military needs \u2014 partly because of the difference in the two countries\u2019 military and economic power.\n\nBangladesh illustrates how growing Chinese power has shrunk India\u2019s profile. Over the past decade China has displaced India as Bangladesh\u2019s largest trading partner \u2014 in 2015, imports from China (including Hong Kong) were 27 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s total imports, while India held closer to 12 per cent. The Bangladeshi military is also importing material from China (including submarines). So two of India\u2019s closest neighbours \u2014 Pakistan and Bangladesh \u2014 are becoming more dependent on Beijing, compounding India\u2019s security dilemma.\n\nBut China\u2019s strengthening military relationships in the region and an unresolved India and China on the Doklam plateau from June to August 2017 are only part of India\u2019s security challenge.\n\nChina\u2019s investment in the aims to help it overcome the \u2018Malacca dilemma\u2019 in which most of its energy supply needs must pass through the Straits of Malacca. The Chinese investment in ports along the Indian Ocean littoral has often been described as a string of pearls, and both Gwadar in Pakistan and the Chinese military station in Djibouti indicate a near-permanent Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.\n\nSo how has this spread of Chinese power affected India?\n\nThe Indian response to the spectrum of challenges presented by Chinese power is multipronged. Doklam is a reflection of the current Indian resolve to act unilaterally and remain firm, even if China adopts an intimidating posture.\n\nAt the bilateral and multilateral levels, India\u2019s Modi government is exploring new partnerships, particularly in the maritime domain. Good order at sea and freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific is now packaged as a collective security objective, and China is being encouraged to come on board. India\u2019s bilateral partnerships with the United States and have acquired a visible naval and maritime sheen, and the possibility of this evolving into a with Australia as a partner has been endorsed by President Trump on his recent trip to Asia.\n\nIf this acquires greater military and policy credibility, then a \u2018diamond necklace\u2019 could emerge \u2014 stoking the Malacca dilemma in an unambiguous way.\n\nMuch will depend on the domestic politics in the four democracies \u2014 India, Australia, Japan and the United States \u2014 and the degree to which their corporate and security elites harmonise their views about how to manage China.\n\nBut the exigency to constrain China by suasion will not unfold in a linear manner, nor is it set in stone. The US\u2013China relationship is more opaque and deeply intertwined than it publicly appears. Trump\u2019s five-nation tour through Asia in November 2017 and its outcome will offer valuable cues about how Beijing under a more confident Xi will use its power and the degree to which can accommodate it.\n\nWhether China becomes more revisionist or is willing to maintain an evolving status quo in global affairs will have significant regional implications that will shape India\u2019s response in the longer term.\n\nChitrapu Uday Bhaskar is a retired Indian Navy Commodore and Director of the Society for Policy Studies, New Delhi.\n\nThis article appeared in the most recent edition of East Asia Forum Quarterly, \u2018China\u2019s influence\u2019."

    "text": "We know that the Australian Government\u2019s planned expansion into arms sales has coincided with a four-fold increase in the number of military licenses for sales to one of the world\u2019s most oppressive regimes. But we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re actually selling them, writes Kellie Tranter.\n\nDocuments recently produced under Freedom of Information laws confirm that in the two years from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017 sixteen military licences were granted for the export of military equipment from Australia to Saudi Arabia. Until now it was widely believed that only four military licences were issued.\n\nRedactions to the FOI documents include the exclusion of any reference to the permit number, permit holder, what the approved goods are, consignees, end-users, approved destinations and even the date the permit was issued, so you have to try to piece the bigger picture together using what\u2019s left.\n\nFive of the licences granted refer to \u2018Approved DSGL Technology\u2019. The Defence and Strategic Goods List is a \u201ccompilation of military and commercial goods and technologies that Australia regulates. The goods, software and technologies on the list are agreed in conjunction with members of various international non-proliferation and export control regimes. These items either have a military use, or can be used to develop weapons of mass destruction. The DSGL also contains Australia-specific controls relating to firearms and explosives.\u201d\n\nThis comes on the back of calls by human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for Australia to disclose defence deals with Saudi Arabia and halt military sales following the unlawful Saudi-led Coalition airstrikes and blockade in Yemen.\n\nIt is well known that the US-backed, Saudi-led airstrikes and naval blockade have devastated Yemen\u2019s health, water and sanitation systems, sparking a massive cholera outbreak and pushing millions of Yemenis to the brink of starvation. More than 15,000 people have died since the Saudi invasion \u2013 backed by Australia \u2013 in 2015.\n\nAsked what Saudi Arabia and the US are hoping to accomplish in Yemen, the Washington editor for Harper\u2019s magazine, Andrew Cockburn, said:\n\n\u201cThe US, it\u2019s not clear at all. The Saudis, basically \u2014 I mean, in the article, I go at some length into the sort of background to all this. But basically, they got freaked out at the thought that Iran was establishing a beachhead on their southern border, which was really kind of hysterical paranoia, because Iran wasn\u2019t really doing that. I mean, they were making some kind of connection with the Houthis, who are a religious minority, tribal minority, living in northern Yemen, but there was very little prospect of Iran setting up bases and so on and so forth.\u2026 And so, the Saudis got more and more sort of outraged as the Houthis took power in Yemen, or seemed to be taking over the country. And the US kind of went along with it.\n\n\u201cI was told, very early on in the war, Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken went to Riyadh to ask \u2026 when they had already been bombing away, using the US bombs, US-supplied bombs, using US weapons, killing already dozens, if not \u2026 hundreds of civilians, destroying factories. And finally, Blinken turns up in Riyadh and asks, \u2018By the way, what are you trying to accomplish here?\u2019 And the Saudis effectively said, or at least the Americans understood them to say, \u2018Well, we basically want to wipe out the Houthis.\u2019 Well, they termed it as \u2018end all Iranian influence in Yemen\u2019. Blinken was a bit shocked by that, so I\u2019m told, and said, \u2018Well, you know, that\u2019s going a bit far. But it\u2019s \u2014 you should certainly stop the Houthis taking over the country\u2019.\n\nAnd that, effectively, gave the Saudis carte blanche to continue this kind of mindless carpet-bombing, in effect, that\u2019s been going on almost ever since. There\u2019s been a bit of a lull over the summer, when you had the peace talks going on.\u201d\n\nAustralia is a signatory to the Arms Trade Treaty, which stipulates that signatories block any arms deal if there is evidence that the weapons will be used against civilians. We haven\u2019t been told whether or how the Department of Defence ensured compliance with this treaty obligation, and we don\u2019t know whether it obtained any legal opinion about whether or not any Australian exports were permitted in violation of the rules of international law.\n\nPutting human rights and morality to one side, which it seems to do all too often when those factors are in play, the Australian Government has made no secret of its desire to grow the Australian arms export industry.\n\nOn 24 October 2016 Kate Louis, First Assistant Secretary Defence Industry Policy, provided a \u2018Departmental Advice\u2019 noting that:\n\n\u201cReports indicate the Royal Saudi Naval Force has been planning an expansion of its eastern fleet with a budget estimated at about $20 billion \u2026 [redacted ] been invited to talk to the Saudi Navy about the program and are seeking Australian Government support in its export endeavours\u2026 Over the past year Defence has assessed or provided in principle approval for exports of a wide range of technologies and goods to various end users in Saudi Arabia. Many of these were dual use technologies which can have civilian applications\u2026.\u201d\n\nTwo months later Christopher Pyne, fully laden with RM Williams bags and books for various Saudi princes and officials, was on a plane to advocate on behalf of private Defence manufacturers seeking to export to Saudi Arabia. No doubt coincidentally, his first stop was Riyadh which headquarters the Royal Saudi Navy.\n\nThe FOI documents include a document dated 25 January 2017 titled \u2018MDIND visit to Europe and Saudi Arabia \u2013 thank you letters\u2019, but with the recipient\u2019s name redacted, that says:\n\n\u201cFollowing your visit to [redacted]Saudi Arabia in December 2016 you requested that Defence draft thank you letters to people you met with\u2026Consultation. Yes, Future Submarine Program [emphasis added].\u201d\n\nOn 24 February 2017 an article published in Pakistan Defence referred to United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia wanting to get submarines.\n\nIn May 2017 Prime Minister Turnbull was outlining the Government\u2019s $89 billion naval shipbuilding plan \u201cto be spent on building 12 submarines, nine frigates and 12 offshore patrol vessels for the Australian navy as well as 19 Pacific patrol boats to be given to neighbouring countries.\u201d It has been further reported that the Osborne shipyard, created as a result, \u201cwill be the epicentre of Australian naval construction until at least the 2050s. Two giant projects will be based there \u2014 the $35 billion future frigates build and $50 billion Future Submarines project\u201d.\n\nIn July 2017 Christopher Pyne delivered a speech \u2018Developing a Defence Export Strategy\u2019 to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute which referred to \u201cThe Australian designed Nulka decoy system that protects ships from missiles not so long ago saved USS Mason from an attack by Houthi rebels off the coast of Yemen.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that \u201cThales has been a major export success story while supporting our own defence needs. Over the past decade or so Thales has exported some $1.6 billion worth of submarine sonars, air traffic control systems and Bushmaster armoured vehicles to Europe, Asia and the nations of the Caribbean. Austal is exporting both Australian manufactured vessels and Australian designs and engineering innovations around the world. In a major triumph for local industry they won a contract worth just under $800 million to build the Independence Class Littoral Combat Ship for the United States Navy at the end of last month.\u201d\n\nThales Australia (formerly ADI Limited) is the Australian branch of the French military engineering firm. Thales Underwater Systems\u2019 Sydney site was the location of choice for the Prime Minister to announce the Government\u2019s $3.8bn fund to underwrite an expansion of arms exports earlier this year.\n\nIronically on the same day it was reported that the Royal Australian Navy had conducted training with its Saudi counterpart on the Red Sea. Defence Connect reported that \u2018Pyne eyes submarine exports\u2019.\n\nYou can see the picture coming together, but the truth about what is going on, and why, is a matter of speculation because the Government is not telling us anything substantial.\n\nThis week a report from French law firm Ancile Avocat asserts that France\u2019s arms exports to Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates could be in contravention of its international commitments and similar criticisms have been levelled at the United States following the US State Department approving a possible arms sale to Saudi Arabia worth more than $1bn.\n\nIrrespective of ethics, morality, human rights or international law the Government seems to be hell bent on ramping up arms exports to countries like Saudi Arabia, which seeks dominance of Sunni Islam in other countries in its region; which has provided \u2018clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL\u2019; which has smuggled cash, weapons and ammunition to highly radicalised groups \u2013 including for example the Army of Islam in Syria \u2018which has paraded caged women as human shields against airstrikes\u2019; which is engaged in a brutal regional conflict knowingly inflicting immeasurable harm on innocent civilians, and which is known to have procured weapons and then transferred them to third parties."

By 6 April Syphax was back at Galati.\n\nConstruction of the other two vessels, Hannon and Sophonisbe, is believed to be underway, with deliveries of all four vessels scheduled for the end of this year.\n\nThe MSOPV is Damen\u2019s second generation offshore patrol vessel design and was revealed several years ago. It incorporates Damen\u2019s Sea Axe hull shape for superior seakeeping \u2013 since the hull is designed to reduce water resistance, the new OPV is fuel efficient and capable of speeds up to 25/26 knots, Damen said.\n\nA Multi-Mission Bay can be equipped with dedicated mission modules (e.g. mission containers) for missions such as counter piracy, counter-drug operations, anti-mining warfare (AMW), search-and-rescue (SAR) etc. The Multi-Mission Bay is also equipped with a nine metre RHIB (rigid-hulled inflatable boat), which can be launched over a dedicated slipway through the rear of the vessel while the OPV is sailing.\n\nThe command-and-control centre is located directly behind the bridge. Damen calls this development their Multi-Mission Bridge. Both spaces can be separated by means of a blinded sliding wall.\n\nThe Multi-Mission Hangar is capable of storing an 11-tonne NH-90 helicopter and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) such as the Boeing ScanEagle. The hangar has been designed so that the OPV crew can deploy either the helicopter or the UAV without having to move either one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second generation Damen offshore patrol vessel is available as a standard in four sizes: 75 meter (1400 tonnes), 85 meter (1800 tonnes), 95 meter (2400 tonnes) and 103 meter (2600 tonnes)."

    "text": "The KATUSA program arose from a shared history of war with North Korea. Both American and South Korean troops fought together, so it made sense to make it official.\n\nGen. Douglas MacArthur and South Korean Pres. Syngman Rhee crafted the arrangement in 1950, and both viewed these \u201caugmentees\u201d as critical to their shared war efforts.\n\nIn June 1950, a North Korean blitzkrieg had pushed Washington and Seoul\u2019s ill-prepared troops into a tiny pocket around the port city of Busan at the southeastern tip of the peninsula.\n\nWith Pyongyang\u2019s forces closing in, MacArthur was desperate for more manpower. Rhee wanted to find ways to improve his fledgling army.\n\nThe chaos of war, along with a cultural and language barriers\u2014and just flat out racism\u2014caused serious difficulties for the program. While in need of extra soldiers, many American commanders distrusted or dismissed the Korean volunteers.\n\n\u201cAn inordinately large percentage of men, particularly in some units, stated at KATUSAs were no good, that they would sleep on guard, \u2018bug out,\u2019 refuse to work or pretend not to know what was expected of them,\u201d an Army team sent to evaluate the service\u2019s performance reported.\n\nDespite orders from Pres. Harry Truman to integrate, Eighth Army had arrived in Korea with official racial boundaries still firmly in place.\n\n\u201cThis mistrust may stem from fact or it may result from pre-existing attitudes,\u201d the team explained. \u201cMany people made the statement that a KATUSA or Puerto Rican or Negro is either an excellent fighter, or he is no good at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf such \u2018extremes\u2019 exist it seems highly likely that they are not inherited.\u201d\n\nIn spite of these barriers, more than 6,000 KATUSAs had given their lives by the end of the war. After the Korean Armistice Agreement stopped the shooting, the Pentagon kept the program going as an established method of training South Korean troops.\n\nNearly 10 years after the armistice, Washington and Seoul agreed to use the arrangement to bulk up Army units throughout the country. In 1968, there were still more than 10,000 KATUSAs aiding the ground combat branch in Korea, according to one Pentagon memo.\n\nThe relative skill level between South Korean troops and their American comrades\u2014and perhaps continuing mistrust\u2014was still an issue. \u201cKATUSA personnel cannot be used in intelligence units to replace U.S. personnel,\u201d the Pentagon memo declared.\n\nAnd for decades, the U.S. essentially had veto power over the South Korean military. The American officer in charge of the Eighth Army \u2014 who had a shared headquarters with South Korean troops called the Combined Forces Command \u2014 was the de facto highest ranking military official in the country.\n\nIn 1994, the two countries finally agreed to allow South Korea\u2014an established sovereign state and growing regional economic powerhouse\u2014to oversee its own military affairs \u2026 during peacetime.\n\nToday, if another war broke out on the peninsula, the Pentagon would still direct South Korean troops at the highest levels."

The system can hit aerodynamic targets at a range of up to 400 kilometers (249 miles) and tactical ballistic targets flying at a speed of 4.8 km/s (3 mi/s) at a distance of up to 60 kilometers (37 miles). Such targets include cruise missiles, tactical and strategic aircraft and ballistic missile warheads.\n\nThe system\u2019s radars detect aerial targets at a distance of up to 600 kilometers (373 miles). The system\u2019s 48N6E3 surface-to-air missiles can hit aerodynamic targets at altitudes of 10,000-27,000 meters and ballistic threats at altitudes of 2,000-25,000 meters.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, China was the first to sign a contract for such systems. Later on, Russia inked an intergovernmental agreement for S-400 sales with India. In 2017, such a contract was signed with Turkey."

Just $5 a month.\n\nThe standard S-400 battery consists of four transporter erector launchers (TELs), four launch tubes per TEL, in addition to target acquisition and engagement (fire control) radar systems and a command post. (With an additional fire control radar system, a battery can consist of up to 12 TELs.) Two batteries make up a S-400 battalion (also known as a S-400 division), whereas a S-400 regiment consists of two battalions.\n\nConsequently, China could receive anywhere between 60 to over 200 TELs including missiles and associated equipment. The S-400 Triumf is one of the world\u2019s most advanced interceptor-based missile defense systems, as I explained elsewhere:\n\nIn comparison to its predecessor, the S-300, the S-400 air defense system features an improved radar system and updated software; it can purportedly fire four new types of surface-to-air (SAM) missiles in addition to the S-300\u2019s 48N6E, a vertical tube launched, solid fuel, single stage SAM with an estimated range of 150 kilometers (93 miles), and the improved 48N6E2 missile with a reported range of 195 kilometers (121 miles). One of the S-400\u2019s new missiles is the so-called 40N6 SAM with an estimated operational range of 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) and an altitude of up to 185 kilometers (607,000 feet). The missile is reportedly capable of exo-atmospheric interception of intermediate-range ballistic missile warheads in their terminal phase. However, it is unclear whether the weapon is operational in Russia yet and no images of the 40N6 SAM have surfaced so far. The S-400 is also armed with an improved variant of the 48N6E2 with an alleged range of 250 kilometers (160 miles). The air defense system can also fire two additional missiles, the 9M96E and 9M96E2 with respective ranges of 40 km (25 miles) and 120 km (75 miles). Improved S-300 air defense systems such as the S-300PMU-2 Favorite \u2026 can purportedly also fire the 9M96E and 9M96E2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia has recently deployed additional S-400 units to its Far Eastern region, specifically the vicinity of Vladivostok, homeport of the Russian Pacific Fleet, in order to protect its expanding naval presence in the Asia-Pacific region from aerial threats."

Our two non-developmental solutions offer the American Air Force a real choice of low risk, low cost solutions, in aircraft flying with coalition partners today.\u201d\n\n- ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW -\n\nBenjamin Cohen from Israel Aerospace Industries\u2019 Lahav Division said: \u201cOur cooperation with Aero Vodochody offers the USAF impressive proven performance of the L-159, with new innovative IAI systems, to provide customers with aircraft that meet their OA-X requirements. Our virtual training system for the L-39NG is truly world class.\u201d\n\nLight jets from Aero are operated by air forces in strategic regions for the US. L-39s operate in East Pacific, Baltic countries, Middle Europe, some African countries and other regions around the globe. It makes AERO\u2019s light jets very easy to operate in partnership with other forces and very easy to support abroad. Both aircraft, l-39NG and L-159, are available to meet the timeframe and production tempo stated by the USAF. AERO is also able to move production, final assembly, training and logistics to the US thus creating hundreds of American jobs. AERO and IAI are now active in finding American partner for the O-AX program.\n\nAERO is traditional producer of military light jets. The company has produced over 6,000 jet aircraft with an accumulated 13,000,000 flight hours by more than 60 military operators. In addition, 15 aerobatic teams, such as the Breitling Jet Team, utilize L-39 aircraft, because of well-earned reputation of the aircraft for reliability, dependability, and cost effectiveness, both in the air and on the ground."

    "text": "The Egyptian Navy will soon receive a naval vessel from South Korea, possible a Po Hang class corvette.\n\nThis is according to the Egyptian Ministry of Defence (MoD), which said on 15 September that Egyptian Defence Minister Sedki Sobhi, during a visit to South Korea earlier this month had inspected \u201cone of the naval pieces that will be joining the Egyptian Armed Forces in the future and met the Egyptian technical crews that are training on it\u201d.\n\nWhile the MoD did not specify what vessel would be delivered, photos it released show Sobhi standing on a Po Hang-class corvette at Jinhae Naval Base. IHS Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly notes that the Republic of Korea Navy received 24 Po Hang-class corvettes and these entered service between 1984 and 1993. Around 18 remain in service. They will be replaced by the Incheon class frigate \u2013 it has also been suggested that Egypt may be getting Incheon vessels.\n\nSobhi\u2019s visit was at the invitation of South Korea and according to the Egyptian MoD conducted \u201cseveral fruitful talks on military cooperation between the armed forces of both countries, including the Korean Defence Minister and a number of officials from the Korean armed forces.\u201d The two sides also looked at challenges in the region and efforts to combat terrorism and achieve security and stability in the Middle East.\n\nDuring the visit, Sobhi conducted a series of field tours, including to a number of training facilities and military industries, including to a shipyard and naval base, during which he held a meeting with the commander of the South Korean navy.\n\nSobhi met South Korean defence minister Song Young-moo in Seoul on 11 September and said that Egypt had expressed interest in procuring South Korean military equipment and entering defence industrial joint-venture programmes. \u201cWe hope that Korea\u2019s excellent defence products will contribute to the strengthening of the defence forces of Egypt,\u201d Sobhi said.\n\nMeanwhile, Egypt has reportedly expressed interest in acquiring K9 155 mm self-propelled howitzer\u2019s from South Korea\u2019s Samsung Techwin, which is optimistic about securing a contract. Egypt has been eyeing the K9 since 2010 when a memorandum of understanding on defence cooperation was signed between the two countries. Egypt has for years expressed interest in acquiring new self-propelled howitzers, most likely to replace its M109s.\n\nSouth Korea-Egypt defence ties received a boost this year when In-moo signed a memorandum of understanding with Sobhi in Cairo in late March. On 10 July a photo appeared on Twitter showing a K9 on a flatbed trailer apparently moving through Egypt for evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Egyptian President Abdul Fatah al-Sisi paid a visit to South Korea in March 2016 in order to promote economic cooperation between Korea and Egypt."

    "text": "News about the decision for India to permanently station fighter jets in the Andaman & Nicobar Group of Islands (ANI) is a welcome move, something that should have happened years back. Deployment of frontline fighter jets is under consideration for deployment at two bases in ANI \u2013 one each at Car Nicobar and at Campbell Bay. IAF already has a base at Car Nicobar but ANI has only one Mi-17V5 unit and two Dornier aircraft permanently stationed. The Andaman & Nicobar Command (ANC) was established on the ANI in 2001 in accordance recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee (KRC) and the follow up Group of Ministers (GoM) reports. But the ANC really doesn\u2019t have much teeth must keep looking over its shoulder at mainland India.\n\nThe ANI stretches 467 km from its northern tip to the southern tip covering some 572 islands. One look at the map would tell you that the geography of ANI is so strategically endowed that it is bang in the centre of the western opening of the Malacca Straits connecting Indian Ocean to the South China Sea (SCS) and Pacific Ocean. ANI is also proximate to the Straits of Sunda, Lumbok and Ombai Wetar (Indonesia). Malacca Straits are strategically most important due to shorter sea journey and because Sunda Straits, though wider than Malacca, are shallower along the eastern end with sandbanks, strong tidal flow and offshore oil platforms off Java making navigation difficult. As for Lombok, it has least width of about 20 Km but depth of 250 m suitable for big ships, even though the travel time is longer.\n\nThe ANC importantly also provides security cover to India\u2019s 5.95 lakh sq km exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the region. Significantly, India has no maritime boundary disputes with any county of Southeast Asia. Taking cue from China\u2019s militarization of the SCS, we should have taken steps to optimize the strategic advantage of ANI much before, but as the say \u2018Der Aaye, Durust Aaye\u2019. Yet, there is much more that needs to be done. 97% of India\u2019s trade is by sea and if India is to fulfill its role as net security provider in the region, then the ANC must have teeth to match its tasks.\n\nChina has been making no bones about her \u2018Malacca Dilemma\u2019 and using that pretext for aggressive presence of the PLA Navy (PLAN) in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). PLAN forays in IOR have increased aggressively in recent years; warships, latest Luyang-III class guided-missile destroyers, nuclear submarines, intelligence gathering vessels, hydrographic research vessels, deep sea explorers etc. At times, movement of Chinese subs have also been reported close to ANI. China is going ahead with establishing some 18 naval bases in the IOR including India\u2019s immediate neighbourhood under the euphuism of \u2018strategic support bases\u2019, and has intensified naval activity with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Gwadar Port together with upcoming PLA base in Jiwani would give China control of entire Pakistani coastline. Hambantota is already leased by Sri Lanka to China for 99 years. China has obtained a Maldivian island close to Male airport on lease for 50 years. Coco Islands off the northern tip of ANI has long been suspected of having been leased to China by Mtanmar has an airstrip and a listening post to monitor Indian missile tests and activities in the Bay of Bengal.\n\nA PLAN task force had to turn turtle from Maldives recently because of Indian naval deployment. More recently, Indian Navy messaged China it will keep an eye over the region by tweeting pictures of Chinese warships entering the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The ANI is actually, a gigantic natural aircraft carrier \u2013 God\u2019s gift to India. It must be, therefore, developed as such. Giving historic perspective of India\u2019s foreign policy at Singapore to an international audience last year during a workshop organized by India Foundation, MJ Akbar, MoS (EAM) had said, \u201cIndia is the western frontier of peace, and the eastern frontier of war\u201d. In keeping with this, ANI must be developed into a \u2018spring board\u2019 to meet the challenges of the Indo-Pacific that are increasing by the day with an overtly aggressive China. As such, ANI must have requisite weapon systems and adequate \u2018power projection\u2019 capabilities. In the same context, ANI must have deployment of submarines also. The Defence Minister must also seriously look at the case for raising a Marine Brigade by the Indian Navy that has been lying in MoD past two decades.\n\nInaugurating a four day naval conclave at New Delhi (May 8-11, 2018) to discuss naval efficiency and combat readiness, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman observed that the Indian Navy has emerged as a \u201cdependable partner\u201d for Indian Ocean Region littoral navies, adding \u201cIndia and the Indian Navy have emerged as the first port of call and a dependable partner for (Indian Ocean Region) IOR littoral navies to address their maritime security needs\u201d. The conclave was being held to review the Navy\u2019s new mission-based deployments philosophy aimed at ensuring peace and stability in the region\u201d. There was no mention in the conclave\n\nabout China creating military and strategic assets in India\u2019s close neighbourhood like in Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Maldives and Sri Lanka who have all signed up to Beijing\u2019s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Post the inaugural address, Sitharaman parried a question from reporters on Chinese ubiquitous presence in the region including a deep-sea port at Gwadar in Pakistan and the establishment of a naval base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.\n\nBoosting the defence potential of ANI should not be lost sight of because of Chinese vibes during Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s informal meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Wuhan recently, given not only China\u2019s past record but also that there are no permanent friends and enemies. Chinese mischief is historical and in this context the Officiating Chinese Ambassador to India made a Machiavellian remark on April 19, 2016 at New Delhi when some of the think tanks were invited to participate in the discussion about SCS that \u201cSomeone in future may dispute the ownership of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands\u201d (http://www.eurasiareview.com/26072016-devious-plans-of-china-to-bring-in-issue-of-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-ownership-analysis/). Also, while the ANI, with its proximity to the Malacca Straits, straddles the major global sea routes, none of its 572 islands have a port which is part of international trade. Developing Port Blair or another port into such facility would give added strategic advantage to India and to the region. Additionally, India must optimize its other island territories including Lakshadweep and Minicoy similarly.\n\nIn the above context, India must also look beyond banking only on the Indo-US Strategic Partnership. For whatever reasons, India denying Australia inclusion in the Malabar 2018 exercise somehow gives impression we have got overawed at Wuhan, whether Australia wanted participation as observer or not, something that could have been discussed. By denying Australian participation, what signal are we giving to the \u2018Quad\u2019? French President Macron visiting Australia said on May 2, 2018, \u201cIf we want to be seen and respected by China as an equal partner, we must organize ourselves\u2026 This new Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis is absolutely key for the region and our joint objectives in the India-Pacific region.\u201d During his recent visit to India, Macron did give the impression, France is not interested to join the \u2018Quad\u2019, but by mentioning the new Paris-Delhi-Canberra axis, he is signaling another strategic partnership, which actually needs to be viewed as an adjunct to the \u2018Quad\u2019. And, geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific can best be dealt through multiple strategic partnerships."

They were handed over on 7 June by US Ambassador to Uganda, Deborah Malac.\n\nThe equipment was received by UPDF Chief of Defense Forces Gen David Muhoozi at the Uganda Rapid Deployment Capability Centre (URDCC) in Jinja district. The URDCC is a unit of the East African standby forces (EASF) that deploys peace keeping troops within the region and continental Africa.\n\n\u201cI commend countries that have demonstrated high levels of peace-keeping, especially the UPDF who have been in Somalia where there is insurgency,\u201d Malac said. She added that the donation is part of the African Peace Rapid Response Partnership to support African countries involved in peacekeeping efforts.\n\n\u201cWe have done little in the past; but this better equipment will enhance our preparedness and readiness to respond to threats in security across the region. This should not been seen as self-serving but to the rest of the world,\u201d said Muhoozi. \u201cThe US has provided $270 million under the African Peace Rapid Response Partnership,\u201d he said, adding that Uganda has been allocated another $51 million for logistics and engineering training.\n\nThe United States has previously donated vehicles and equipment to Uganda, including six Cougar mine-resistant, ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles in 2016/17 and 15 Cougars and 10 RG33s in 2014, according to the US Excess Defense Articles database.\n\nIn September 2017 the UPDF received 19 Acmat/Mack Bastion armoured personnel carriers (APCs) from the United States for its contingent with the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the aerial side, the US donated two Cessna 208B Caravan light aircraft to the UPDF Air Wing in March 2015, and is delivering five refurbished UH-1H Huey helicopters to Uganda this year."

A third Bell 429 is scheduled for delivery to the JDF next year. The three aircraft will be used to complete a range of missions including, search and rescue, medical evacuations, natural disaster relief, national security and military training.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are proud to celebrate today\u2019s delivery and strengthen our rich history with the JDF. The Bell 429 is the most technologically advanced aircraft in its class and these modern platforms will provide the JDF with enhanced mission capabilities well into the future.\u201d\n\n--Jay Ortiz, senior vice president, Commercial Business \u2013 Americas\n\n\n\nThe JDF began its helicopter operations in 1963 with two Bell 47Gs. Its active fleet includes four Bell 407s, two Bell 412s and two Bell 206s.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the years, our mission has evolved resulting in the need to acquire the Bell 429 to more effectively meet the demands of our mission profiles and further prove our rotary wing capability,\u201d said Colonel Roderick Williams, the JDF\u2019s Colonel Adjutant Quartermaster and a former Commanding Officer of the JDF Air Wing. \u201cThe Bell 429 offers excellent performance and advanced avionics with outstanding maintainability and aircraft readiness for multi-mission operations.\u201d\n\n\n\nDesigned with the future in mind, the Bell 429 meets or exceeds today\u2019s airworthiness requirements to enhance occupant safety, with the adaptability to remain at the forefront as mission requirements evolve. Advanced capabilities of the 429 include single pilot IFR, Category A operations and an integrated avionics glass cockpit. The use of metallic and composite parts in its construction creates balance between rigidity and flexibility, safety and durability.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadquartered in Fort Worth, Texas \u2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Textron Inc., \u2013 we have strategic locations around the globe. And with nearly one quarter of our workforce having served, helping our military achieve their missions is a passion of ours.\n\n\n\nTextron Inc. is a multi-industry company that leverages its global network of aircraft, defense, industrial and finance businesses to provide customers with innovative solutions and services.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

They were received by the Chief of Logistics Air Vice Marshal Bello Garba. The newly delivered aircraft will now be assembled in Nigeria by a team of Pakistan Air Force and NAF technicians prior to test flying and formal induction into the NAF.\n\nAir Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, Director of Public Relations and Information at the Nigerian Air Force, said in a statement that the NAF took delivery of the first batch of five new Super Mushshaks on 14 July 2017, following which the aircraft were inducted and deployed for primary training of NAF pilots. Some NAF personnel had undergone training in Pakistan, as instructor pilots and technicians on the Super Mushshak, as part of the contract.\n\nAdesanya noted that by 2015, local primary flying training in the NAF was almost grounded, necessitating the procurement of new trainers. \u201cConsequently, with the delivery of the new Super Mushshak aircraft, primary flying training of NAF pilots at 401 Flying Training School (FTS), Kaduna has just received a boost. Without doubts, the delivery of the aircraft would go a long way in helping to sustain the process of building capacity to effectively prosecute the counterinsurgency operations in the North East as well as other forms of criminalities in the country.\u201d\n\nWhilst it awaited the delivery of the ten new Super Mushshaks from Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), the NAF in December 2016 received four Pakistan Air Force examples to use temporarily.

The AF-1C is based on the TA-4KU two-seat fighter. The aircraft was delivered to the AF-1/1A Aircraft Inspection and Receiving Group on April 23 in Gavi\u00e3o Peixoto, Brazil.\n\n\n\nBrazil signed a contract to upgrade nine single-seat A-4KU's to the AF-1B standard and three TA-4KU's to the AF-1C standard in 2009. The contract, awarded to Embraer, was worth $140 million. The first aircraft, an A-4KU, was delivered in May 2015. However, delays mounted after that and by July 2017, Brazil even considered cancelling the program. Ultimately, Brasilia decided against that move, and the program now seems to be back on track.\n\n\n\nUpgrades include a new electric power generation system, a new multimode radar, a glass cockpit, and a new weapons management system. In addition, prime contractor Embraer developed a new suite of mission software.\n\n\n\nThe aircraft, with a serial number N-1022, will be used by training and operational qualification pilots of the 1st Squadron of Intercept and Attack Aircraft (EsqdVF-1). In addition, \"Falcon 1022\" may participate in various operational tasks of the Squadron.\n\n\n\n-ends-\n\n"

It seemed as though the education budget increased under the current government, but in reality, it didn\u2019t because the budget was for two ministries \u2013 the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Science and Technology,\u201d he explained, as the NLD government had incorporated the Ministry of Science and Technology into the education ministry.\n\nThe budget proposed by the Health and Sports Ministry was only 400 billion kyats for a six months period, and that amount is not sufficient to spend both on the health and sports sectors, he added.\n\nDeputy Minister for Defense Maj-Gen Myint Nwe told Parliament that the Defense Ministry is expected to earn 31.761 billion kyats in normal revenue; its capital expenditure is expected to be 611.087 billion kyats; its normal expenditure, 723.107 billion kyats; and total expenditure is, therefore, 1.33 trillion kyats for the six-month transitional period.\n\nHe told Parliament, \u201cThe money is used to implement plans to strengthen the structure of soldiers, weapons, equipment for perpetuity of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Union.\u201d\n\nLower House lawmaker U Tun Tun of Pwintbyu Township, who was on the budget scrutinizing committee, said that the defense budget is rarely cut, but when the Defense Ministry asked for an additional budgetary top-up for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the committee cut around 280 million kyats because government agencies are restricted by law from obtaining an extra budget of more than 10 percent of their main budget.\n\n\u201cThe defense budget has never been trimmed. However, we will check whether the army asked for its budget in accordance with financial rules and regulations. If we find that the budget was increased unnecessarily, we will scrutinize and cut it,\u201d he said.\n\nTo compare the defense budgets for normal expenditures, the Defense Ministry asked for 609.627 billion kyats for the first half of 2016-17 FY, 827.149 billion kyats for the first half of 2017-18 FY, and 723.107 billion kyats for the six-month period in 2018.\n\nAnd to compare the defense budgets for capital expenditures, it asked for 168.498 billion kyats for the first half of 2016-17 FY, 622.440 billion kyats for the first half of 2017-18 FY, and 618.017 billion kyats for the six-month period.\n\nTranslated from Burmese by Myint Win Thein."

Azerbaijan has bought Israeli anti-ship missiles, and Kazakhstan is starting to build a navy of its own, although it is small \u2014 three domestically-produced Kazakhstan-class missile boats and 20 patrol boats as of 2016.\n\nIt would be tough to call this build-up an arms race, given the size.\n\nHowever, the region\u2019s armed forces take the possibility of a conflict seriously enough to use it as a basis for military exercises, such as a 2012 exercise between Russia and Kazakhstan simulating an Iranian attack across the Arabogazk\u00f6l Aylagy, a shallow depression in Turkmenistan adjacent to the Caspian Sea and the Kazakh border.\n\nA 2012 Russian military map simulating an Iranian attack across the Arabogazk\u00f6l Aylagy. Photo via Russian Internet\n\nThe Caspian is also a highway for Russian power, and Russia\u2019s Caspian Flotilla is the single largest armed force on the sea. As the world watched in surprise in 2015, Russian corvettes launched long-range Kalibr cruise missiles from the sea to targets in Syria \u2014 some 1,000 miles away \u2014 in an example of how the Caspian serves as \u201cstrategic depth,\u201d a military term for the space a combatant can exploit beyond its core territories.\n\nIran has hedged its modest military build-up with naval diplomacy, sending ships on port visits across the sea. Iran has also participated in joint military exercises in the Caspian with Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.\n\nDamavand was a key part of this strategy, as she \u2014 festooned in a banner displaying the image of the Ayatollah \u2014 docked in the Kazakh port of Aktau in April 2017 along with the corvette Paykan. \u201cThe Iranian Navy\u2019s flotilla \u2026 is slated to convey Iran\u2019s message of peace and friendship to Kazakhstan,\u201d Iran\u2019s Fars News Agency reported at the time.\n\nThe loss of Damavand is a blow to these ambitions.

    "text": "According to a Chinese military spokesman, China's first stealth fighter, the Chengdu J-20, has officially entered service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force. First revealed in 2011, the J-20 is only the third stealth fighter to enter service with any air force, after the F-22A Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Defense, Senior Colonel Wu Qian , made the announcement on September 28th in Beijing. The aircraft was known as the J-20 during development, but the operational aircraft is apparently called the J-20A. This mirrors the development of the F-22 Raptor, which was labelled the F-22A Raptor when it entered service with the U.S. Air Force in 2005.\n\nChina's development of the J-20A goes back to the late 1990s, when the government decided to begin work on a large, twin engine fighter. The first leaked photos of the aircraft appeared in December 2010, and the fighter was finally sighted in early January 2011 at Huangtianba airfield. U.S. intelligence expected the J-20A would enter service in 2018.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe J-20 has had a very public development period, with at least seven prototypes appearing over the last six years, often with subtle but important improvements. The fighter's nose shape, canopy, air intakes, and wheel doors were all altered and improved. Engineers added radar-absorbent paint to further reduce the J-20's radar signature. An infrared search and track sensor was added, which uses infrared cameras to detect, identify, track and ultimately shoot at enemy aircraft with infrared guided missiles.\n\nYet another addition was a distributed aperture system (DAS), a series of cameras mounted on the airplane that allows the pilot to \"see\" in all directions using a 4K cockpit display. The only other fighter with a DAS is the F-35.\n\nThe official role of the J-20A is unknown, but it is most likely meant as a long-range fighter. The airplane stores all of its weapons internally to preserve its radar-evading shape, and has three internal bays : one large bay for up to six PL-12 beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, roughly the same as the American AIM-120 missile, and two smaller bays with one short range air-to-air missile each.\n\nJ-20 fighters have flown with the 176 Brigade, a part of the air force's China Flight Test Establishment, for approximately a year. It's unclear what unit of the PLAAF the J-20A is operational with.\n\nThis content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

(Reuters Photo/Adnan Abidi)\n\nJakarta. There is no risk of US sanctions following Indonesia's $1.14 billion deal to purchase 11 Sukhoi fighter jets from Russia, an official said on Monday (13/08).\n\n\"There is no pressure from the US regarding this [...] We are targeting to finish [the transaction] as soon as possible,\" Oke Nurwan, director general of foreign trade at the Ministry of Trade, told reporters.\n\nOke's words contradict his last week's statement that the United States has \"started to intervene\" after Russia agreed to the Sukhoi deal in February.\n\nIndonesia is going to buy the jets in a counter-purchase deal, in which Russia will buy Indonesian commodities for 50 percent of the Sukhoi price. Russia is currently reviewing the agreement. The commodities include rubber, tea, coffee, palm oil and its derivatives, and textiles.\n\n\"We are now still drafting the rules for a working group to discuss the commodities that Russia must buy from Indonesia in return,\" Oke said.\n\nThe working group will consist of officials from Indonesia Trading Company (PPI) and Russia's military contracting company Rostec.\n\nOn Saturday, Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said the aircraft are scheduled to start arriving in October next year.\n\nIn August 2017, President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia to punish President Vladimir Putin for the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The sanctions extend to all US allies that purchase Russian weapons and equipment."

    "text": "The Tunisian Navy has taken delivery of another two SAFE Boats International patrol boats from the United States, which will also erect 13 radar stations along the Tunisian coast to protect the country\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nUS Ambassador to Tunisia Daniel Rubinstein handed the SAFE Boats International 65 Full Cabin Inboard patrol boats over to the Ministry of Defence during a ceremony on 16 January. \u201cThe boats on display here are the latest of a series of 26 boats that were first ordered in 2012,\u201d Rubinstein said. \u201cThese boats represent just one facet of our security cooperation, of which we are already seeing the fruit in the recent successes of the courageous Tunisian security forces in their counter-terrorism efforts. I can assure you that the US stands together with Tunisia at this critical time, and we are determined to give Tunisia the tools and assistance to help it defeat and deter terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe vessels delivered by SAFE Boats International from 2013 vary in size from 25 to 65 feet and include three SAFE 44 foot Full Cabin Inboards, five 27 foot Full Cabins, five 25 foot Full Cabins, and seven 25 foot Centre Console boats. Tunisia also received two 13.5 metre MetalCraft Marine Sentry 44 patrol boats from the United States.\n\nThe first of the four most recent 65 foot boats was delivered in early 2015. These Full Cabin Inboard boats are powered by two 1 600 hp MTU 10V2000 diesel engines, giving a top speed in excess of 40 knots. Range can be up to 400 nautical miles.\n\nRubinstein said that, starting this summer, 13 radar stations along the Tunisian coasts will be equipped with new costal radars which will reinforce the presence of the Tunisian navy and improve its capabilities in Tunisia\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nThese radar stations form part of the continent-wide Regional Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) programme being rolled out by the US Department of Defence. PAE (formerly Computer Sciences Corporation) is the prime contractor and on 12 December said it will deliver key command, control, communications, and surveillance (C3/S) capabilities to the Tunisian Navy.\n\nThe Tunisia project allows for multiple maritime sensors to be integrated into a common operating picture for the Tunisian Navy. This new capability will fully integrate and correlate multiple data sources to provide increased maritime domain awareness and allow for better tracking of small and large vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the handover speech, Rubinstein said Tunisia was to participate in Exercise Phoenix Express 17 this year involving over a dozen Mediterranean navies in the western Mediterranean. \u201cThis exercise will focus on conducting regional maritime interdictions and law enforcement operations in accordance with international maritime law, Maritime Domain Awareness, and informational sharing capabilities.\n\n\u201cIn the coming year, we will assist Tunisia not only at sea, but on land with the installation of a border security system on Tunisia\u2019s eastern border, and the provision of equipment and training to identify and counter improvised explosive devices, and in the air with training and equipment to allow the Tunisian Air Force to better integrate and operate in conjunction with its land forces.\n\n\u201cThese boats, radar stations, training, and exercises represent a clear picture of the strong US commitment to standing with Tunisia at sea, as Tunisia fights terrorism, and assists in the management of unprecedented migrant flows across the Mediterranean. At the same time, these efforts and systems will enable Tunisia to better police its fisheries and guarantee the safety of maritime traffic through a close point of approach between North Africa and Europe,\u201d Rubinstein said."

Preliminary approval for the deal was given in June 2009 and a \u2018request for proposal\u2019 (akin to a tender) was issued in April 2010.\n\nHowever, said defence minister Nirmala Seetharaman, the government has \u2018retracted\u2019 the request for proposal for the missiles as on Dec 20, 2017.\n\nThis, she said, was done after the Defence Research and Development Organization was successful in creating an indigenous anti-tank missile that can be manufactured without the aid of any technology licensing from foreign companies.\n\n\u201cOn account of indigenous development of 3rd Generation Man-Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile (MPATGM) system by Defence Research & Development Organization, it was, inter alia, decided that there is no need to acquire ToT with the ATGM system,\u201d Seetharam said.\n\nThe MPATGM, which weighs around 20 kg, can be used by Infantry Battalions against Armoured vehicles up to 2.5km in range and will replace the Soviet-era anti-tank missiles used by Indian army. It will compete with units such as the US\u2019 Javelin missiles (picture above).\n\nIndia is estimated to require about 80,000 anti-tank missiles. The DRDO variant, meanwhile, is expected to complete final testing this year."

    "text": "Kenya has requested the purchase of 12 MD 530F helicopters from the United States, at a proposed cost of $253 million including weapons, ammunition and support.\n\nThe US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on 2 May announced that the US State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to Kenya for the helicopters, with the DSCA notifying Congress of the possible sale on 1 May.\n\nThe deal would include the helicopters, to be supplied by MD Helicopters, as well as 24 Heavy Machine Gun Pod (HMP) 400 systems; 24 M260 rocket launchers; 4 032 M151 rockets; 1 536 2.75-inch M274 smoke signature warhead rockets; and 400 000 rounds of .50 calibre ammunition.\n\nAlso included are communications and navigation equipment, contractor logistics support, training, US Government technical assistance, airframe and weapon system spare parts support, Contractor Field Service Representative (CFSR) support, and Special Assigned Airlift Mission (SAAM) flight delivery support.\n\n\u201cThis proposed sale contributes to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of a strong regional partner who is a regional security leader, undertaking critical operations against al-Shabaab, and a troop contributor to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM),\u201d the DSCA said.\n\n\u201cThe proposed sale of the MD 530F helicopters, weapons, ammunition, support items and technical support will advance Kenya\u2019s efforts to conduct scout and attack rotary wing aircraft operations in support of their AMISOM mission. The MD 530F will also replace Kenya\u2019s aging MD500 fleet, which is the current reconnaissance platform supporting Kenyan ground forces. This sale will significantly enhance the Kenyan Army\u2019s modernization efforts and increase interoperability with the US Armed Forces and other partners in the region. Additionally, a strong national defence and dedicated military force will assist Kenya in its efforts to maintain stability in East Africa.\u201d\n\nThe MD 530F as an evolution of the OH-6 Cayuse light observation helicopter that goes back to the Vietnam War. It is powered by a Rolls-Royce 250-C30 turboshaft engine producing 317 kW at takeoff and giving a cruise speed of 248 km/h with a maximum range of 430 km and a service ceiling of 5 700 m. The helicopter can carry a 980 kg external load.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe armed MD 530F has been deployed by the Afghan Air Force since 2011."

    "text": "India has decided to supply four Mi-35 attack helicopters to Afghanistan over the next four months to help the war-ravaged nation intensify its anti-terror operations against the Pakistan-backed Taliban, Afghan diplomatic sources said.\n\nSources said India proposed to go in for outright purchase of the Russian-made helicopters from Belarus since it would have taken a long time to procure the choppers if it were to place an order for their supplies.\n\nIndia had supplied four Mi-25 attack helicopters to Afghanistan in 2015-16 to bolster the strength of the Afghan forces while refusing to make any compromise on its long-standing stand that there shall be no Indian boots on the ground in the embattled country. Lately, India has been deeply concerned over an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan unleashed by the Taliban, which continues to receive support from the Pakistani establishment.\n\nSources said India\u2019s decision to supply four more helicopters to Afghanistan was taken after the US and other key Western powers nudged New Delhi to play a pro-active role in stabilising the situation in the country. India is already giving training to nearly 1,000 Afghan soldiers in its premier defence institutions.\n\nThe US has found itself handicapped in assisting the Afghan forces because most of the lethal military equipment with them is of Russian origin. Quite a few helicopters with the Afghan forces have been grounded due to lack of spare parts.\n\nThe US and NATO member countries are prohibited from purchasing Russian-made military hardware, including the parts needed to repair the helicopters given the Western-imposed sanctions on Russia. Consequently, the US government has repeatedly requested Indian military assistance to the AAF since 2014.\n\nSources, meanwhile, said India and Afghanistan also propose to soon hold in Kabul the next meeting of the strategic council between them to consider ways to enhance the fighting prowess of the Afghan forces. The council had held its last meeting in New Delhi last year.\n\nSources said the US, too, has started implementing its four-year defence plan in Afghanistan. Under the plan, the strength of the Afghan Air Force (AAF) will be increased three-fold. The capability of Afghan special forces will also be enhanced substantially.\n\nOn the air corridor established between India and Afghanistan last year to circumvent the problems being created by Pakistan for trade between them, sources said it had indeed helped the two countries increase trade and commercial links. As a result, trade between Afghanistan and Pakistan had decreased considerably."

He cautioned Turkey, a sovereign state and NATO member, that the US does \u201cnot recommend\u201d the purchase.\n\n\u201cTurkey had a choice to make, a sovereign decision to make. But clearly Turkey bringing a Russian anti-aircraft, anti-missile system into a NATO country, we cannot integrate that into NATO,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cYes, it does concern us and we do not recommend that.\u201d\n\nThe US blocked the sale of American-made F-35 jet fighters to Turkey earlier this month in response to Ankara\u2019s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 air defense system. However, Turkey intends to press ahead with the purchase, and already made the first payment for the system last year. Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport said that the first batch of S-400 systems will be delivered to Turkey next year.\n\nRead more\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended his decision to buy from Russia, arguing that the US has turned down his requests for more hardware for years.\n\n\u201cAre we going to depend on the U.S. again?\u201d the Turkish strongman said in June. \u201cWhen we have been demanding from them for years, the answer that has been given to us is: The [U.S.] Congress is not allowing.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Erdogan added that he fully intended to put the new defense systems to use. \u201cWe will not just buy the S-400s and place them in a storehouse. We will use them if need be,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a defense system. What are we going to do with it if not use this defense system?\u201d\n\nThe deepening rift between the US and Turkey over the S-400 has been exacerbated by Turkey\u2019s continued detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Brunson has been held in Turkey since 2016 over alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt against Erdogan\u2019s government, and is facing 35 years in prison.\n\nAs the war of words over Brunson escalated, US President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminum tariffs on Turkish imports up to 50 and 20 percent respectively earlier this month. Ankara retaliated by raising tariffs on 22 American-made products, ranging from cars to tobacco and also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the US move.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!"

The newly minted combined aerospace business would have had sales of about $39 billion last year, United Technologies said.\n\nHayes will stay on as CEO of the aerospace business. The company did not name leaders for the separated Otis and Carrier businesses.\n\nFounded in 1934, United Technologies is based in Farmington, Connecticut, and currently employs about 205,000 people. It did not say if any jobs would be lost in the breakup.\n\n\u00d7 Fear of missing out?

These Rafale Ms were equipped for air-to-air operations, but lacked any armaments for air-to-ground missions.\n\nF2 standard gave the Rafale also air-to-ground and reconnaissance capabilities. The latest versions, F3 and F3R, gave the aircraft nuclear capabilities and it can operate with the most advanced air-to-air missiles and precision ground attacks munitions."

The vehicle is manufactured by the 140th Repair Plant in Boriso.\n\nUnveiled in 2015, the Cayman armoured vehicle weighs about 7 000kg and can carry six people including the crew. Its steel monocoque hull provides STANAG 4569 Level 3 protection and has a V-shaped hull. The vehicle is powered by a Minsk Motor Plant D-245.30E2 diesel engine delivering 170 hp, giving a maximum road speed of 110 km/h and 8 km/h in water with the use of water-jets.\n\nVarious weapons systems and turrets can be mounted, including an Adunok remotely controlled weapons station or machineguns and automatic grenade launchers. It can reach speeds of up to 110 km/h on ideal road conditions and has a range of 1,000 kilometres. Belarus is believed to have begun putting the vehicle into service with its military since May 2017.\n\nThe Ivory Coast\u2019s Gendarmerie operates French VAB and BTR-80 armoured personnel carriers as well as the BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicle \u2013 one of the latter was seen in the 7 August parade. Its Army operates Bastion and Saxon armoured personnel carriers.\n\nAnother recent addition to the Ivory Coast\u2019s military is two second hand Antonov An-26B transports, formerly operated by Rose Air. They were delivered on 19 and 23 July and go a long way in rejuvenating the country\u2019s tiny air force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the Ivory Coast has only received a few items of military equipment since the 2011 civil war, including a Predator patrol craft from China, three RPB 33 patrol boats from France and four AT-105 Saxon armoured patrol vehicles for use in United Nations operations in Mali."

    "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe armed forces account for 6 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s annual budget, totaling $3.2 billion in the year 2017-2018, according to official statistics. Yet Bangladesh\u2019s military has proved to be incapable of showing strength in the face of repeated violations of its land, sea, and airspace by neighboring Myanmar.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s military has failed to restore public confidence that it can defend the country\u2019s territorial sovereignty. If there is an overriding message from these debacles, it is that the military is ill-equipped to defend the state because it has been practically unaccountable since the very foundation of Bangladesh. Instead, the military has captured much of the bedrock of the state it is supposed to defend.\n\nThe Bangladesh military inherited both the institutional framework of its British Indian and Pakistan Army predecessors, as well as their orientation against civilian rule and their sensitivity to political power. The Bangladesh military has directly ruled the country for 15 of its 46 years of existence.\n\nOn September 15, 1991, a parliamentary system of government was proposed in the 12th Amendment Act, and a constitutional referendum ratified the institutional framework for parliamentary democracy in Bangladesh. Still, to date, even Bangladesh\u2019s democratically elected civilian leaders have been forced to tread carefully around the military. Some current Bangladeshi politicians have a military background, and often discourage the government from engaging in military matters.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nMany developing countries, even those with generally democratic governments, have very weak oversight of defense matters. Bangladesh is no different. For historical reasons, many believe that the military sector is a \u201cno-go area\u201d for civilian oversight. State security is often used as an excuse for secrecy, resulting in insufficient transparency in defense budgeting and procurement. The defense sector believes that they require special treatment compared to other public sectors since they deal with national security matters. The military itself discourages \u201cinterference\u201d from parliament, or from the civilian government.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nFurther complicating things, Bangladesh\u2019s armed forces also have a dual role as internal security forces. The Bangladesh military is repeatedly called on to prevent civil unrest. For example, the military intervened in 2007 amid unrest when the two major political parties were battling over who would come to power.\n\nThe dual role causes significant issues of prioritization. Bangladesh\u2019s military must juggle its national security and internal stability responsibilities, in addition UN peacekeeping missions and disaster relief operations.\n\nIn addition, the political involvement of the military in internal affairs makes it hard for the civil administration, such as the Ministry of Defense and parliament, to hold the the military accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Armed Forces Division (AFD) is the principal administrative organization by which military policy is formulated and executed. The Ministry of Defense (MoD) should exercise authority over the Armed Forces; however, it is far less potent than the AFD. Weak governance, civil authority, and lack of accountability make it difficult to see defense policies executed.\n\nCurrently, both the AFD and the MoD are headed by the prime minister of Bangladesh. To coordinate military policy, both the president (who is also the commander-in-chief of the military) and the prime minister of Bangladesh are advised by a six-member advisory board, three chiefs of staff, the principal staff officer of the AFD, and military secretaries to the president and the prime minister. The current convoluted military and civilian organization make it hard for the government to push through changes in military structure or defense procurement.\n\nFor example, the defense budget is not well planned and executed based on national security but rather is focused on a procurement list catered for Forces Goal 2030. As a result, Bangladesh military budgeting and expenditure processes fall short of international best practices.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s defense procurement suffers from a disconnect between policy and budgeting and procurement practices. Military budgeting and procurement should be linked to established defense policy goals, not Forces Goal 2030. Because decision-making is carried out in a policy vacuum, the result is wasting money on unnecessary systems while failing to meet genuine security needs. There is also an enhanced risk of corruption.\n\nWeak monitoring, controls, and audits facilitate corruption and waste. Sometimes the parliament, the auditor general of Bangladesh, and the anti-corruption watchdog are reluctant to investigate the military \u2014 or even actively prevented from doing so. Even in the absence of dishonesty, failure to implement due process often leads to purchases of high-cost items of questionable strategic purpose, severe delays, and cost overruns.\n\nBangladesh provides limited information on military expenditures, other than a headline defense budget figure. Often, the military expenditure figures are not defined, or the definitions have changed, and it is not clear whether figures are linked to budgeted expenditures or not. Bangladesh systematically excludes significant items from its expense reporting; it also bans disclosing expenditures for arms imports, similar to other developing nations.\n\nIt has been well-documented by SIPRI that the international arms trade and, more specifically, arms procurement practices in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are highly susceptible to waste and corruption. The Bangladesh military\u2019s off-budget spending is often contributed to the military\u2019s business activities, rather than national defense.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Just $5 a month.\n\nFollowing the Pakistani military\u2019s business model, Sena Kallyan Sangstha (SKS), a concern of the Bangladesh Army, operates a dairy farm and an ice cream factory. The BBC reveals that the Bangladeshi military has stakes in food, textile, jute, garment, electronic, real estate, automobile, shipbuilding, manufacturing, and travel businesses. The military also operates Trust Bank and the Ansar VDP Bank, and has a record of giving illicit loans from these institutions to top officers. According to the BBC investigation, the Bangladesh Army\u2019s business interests further include power plants, roads, infrastructure, and bridge projects, amounting to billions of dollars of private assets.\n\nIn 2009, the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) mutiny \u201cwas partly fuelled by resentment among the BDR\u2019s rank-and-file over the corruption of army officers engaged in the retail sale of consumer items,\u201d BBC notes, citing Bangladesh\u2019s official report on the incident.\n\nSome leading Bangladeshi figures in the business sector have admitted that military-owned businesses are virtually indistinguishable from other commercial enterprises in the way they operate. The irony is that military business interests have thrived more under the civilian rule than under the martial law regime of General Hossain Mohammad Ershad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, as Bangladesh\u2019s military ambitions develop, it\u2019s past time for a debate about whether the military should engage in such business activities or instead concentrate on national security and protection of sovereignty.\n\nRyan Smith is a defense analyst based in Australia."

    "text": "When information-technology providers fight for U.S. government contracts, they're finding more and more that size matters.\n\nThey can either pull back from the business, as military contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman did with sales of IT divisions over the past decade, or expand. That's the response General Dynamics chose with the $9.6 billion takeover of cybersecurity specialist CSRA, a deal that will make the combined company one of the biggest suppliers in the field.\n\n\"The strategy may be neatly summed up as 'bigger is better,'\" Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn said in a report. \"We largely agree with that view.\" Leidos Holdings' success in integrating the IT business it purchased from Lockheed Martin for $4.6 billion shows the potential payoff for the move, he noted.\n\nThe deal positions Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics to take advantage of higher military spending under President Trump, who signed a government funding bill last week that calls for defense funding to rise to $700 billion this year and $716 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cRecent events such as the newly-approved increase in budget, the realization that awarding to the lowest bidder has not worked and quality matters, all aligned at this point to make the combination of General Dynamics and CSRA a market-changing event,\u201d said Dan Johnson, who heads the purchaser\u2019s information technology and services business.\n\nGeneral Dynamics agreed to pay $6.8 billion for the company, a 27 percent premium to its four-week average share price, and take over its $2.8 billion debt. Afterward, CSRA \u2013 which specializes in fields from cybersecurity to building digital platforms \u2013 will be rolled into General Dynamics Information Technology, or GDIT.\n\n\u201cWe believe in that information-technology service space,\u201d General Dynamics CEO Phebe N. Novakovic said Monday. \"We\u2019re good at it. We know how to do it. We\u2019re adding to our core.\"\n\nThe transaction creates the U.S. government\u2019s second-biggest information-technology contractor, outranked only by Leidos, the renamed Science Applications International Corp. After adding CSRA\u2019s $5 billion in revenue, the combined General Dynamics information-tech business will have roughly $9.5 billion in annual sales.\n\nWhile larger companies are better able to compete for the bigger IT contracts the government is starting to favor, there are risks, said Krishna Sinha, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners. Integrating staff and operations after a buyout typically hurts a contractor's win rate for an extended period, he said, and CSRA's success at winning contract renewals has waned since its spinoff from Computer Sciences Corp in 2015.\n\n\"We did not see this particular deal coming,\" Sinha wrote, with most prime contractors moving away from federal information-technology work because they're not cost-competitive enough to win contracts.\n\nWhile the field is ripe for consolidation, it makes more sense among companies that specialize in that industry alone than for major contractors like General Dynamics focused on equipment, he said.\n\n\"Investors will be confused as to why General Dynamics is deciding to lean in to the IT market at this juncture when its peers have decided to pull away from it, and furthermore why they are deciding to buy a company struggling with recompete risk,\" Sinha wrote.\n\nLockheed emphasized the need to focus on its core aerospace and defense businesses when selling its information-systems unit for $6 billion in 2016, while Northrop cited compliance with new conflict-of-interest laws when shedding its analytics business in 2009.\n\nPrior to buying CSRA, General Dynamics' information systems business accounted for nearly a third of its $30.9 billion in annual revenue. It was the fastest-growing unit by revenue, with a gain of about 9.5 percent in the last three months of 2017, according to Credit Suisse's Spingarn.\n\nThe deal values CSRA at roughly 1.8 times estimated 2018 revenue, compared with a median multiple of 1.3 for similar transactions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nGeneral Dynamics has slipped less than 1 percent to $211.81 in New York trading since announcing the deal, while rivals Northrop and Lockheed have climbed, as has the broader S&P 500."

(Israel Aerospace Industries via Getty Images)\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 The Czech Republic\u2019s defense minister has ordered the military police to launch an investigation into the pending purchase of eight ELM-2084 multimission radars from Elta Systems, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries.\n\nKarla Slechtova said she decided to probe the planned contract due to \u201cextremely serious findings,\u201d local news agency CTK reported. The military police is also looking into the Defence Ministry\u2019s ongoing procedure to acquire 12 multipurpose helicopters, according to the minister.\n\nThe acquisition is estimated to be worth about 3.6 billion koruna (U.S. $163.5 million).\n\nLast March, Slechtova said she would not sign the deal unless the 3-D radars are interoperable with NATO\u2019s air-defense system. The move followed a decision by the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency that declined to approve the documentation for the acquisition. Without the institution\u2019s certification, it would be impossible to integrate the radars with NATO infrastructure, according to the minister.\n\nThe purchase is to allow the Czech military to replace its obsolete Soviet-designed radars with new equipment."

The law paves the way for the development of the country\u2019s defense industry and the export of weapons and equipment by local players.\n\nEstonian Defence Minister J\u00fcri Luik said in a statement that, to date, the Estonian military has acquired its gear almost exclusively abroad, but now the situation is expected to change, and export opportunities for the country\u2019s defense industry will also increase.\n\n\u201cThe absence of a right to handle weapons and ammunition has long been a serious concern for Estonia\u2019s defense industry, one that hinders the development of the defense sector,\u201d Luik said.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s summary states it \u201cprovides a legal framework for Estonian companies to begin to manufacture, maintain, import and export military weapons, ammunition, munitions and combat vehicles. The existing legislation does not allow this.\u201d\n\nThe ministry expects between five and six local companies to apply for the required licenses in the first year.\n\nThe move comes as Estonia is planning a defense spending hike, with military expenditure to total \u20ac2.4 billion (U.S. $2.8 billion) in the next four years, according to Luik. Last April, the ministry unveiled the country\u2019s updated investment program for the years 2018-2022. Among others, Estonia aims to purchase munitions for about \u20ac100 million.\n\nOwing to the amended legislation, Estonian defense companies could also become suppliers to neighboring Lithuania and Latvia.\n\nLithuania has allocated \u20ac873 million to its defense budget this year, up 20.6 percent compared with 2017. Latvia\u2019s military expenditure for 2018 is to reach \u20ac576.34 million, up \u20ac126.8 million compared with a year earlier."

    "text": "Already suffering from allegations of bribery and cost overruns on several naval orders, ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems has now been barred from bidding to build Germany's next generation of battleships.\n\n(Source: dpa) Not shipshape: The F125 frigate.\n\nAn ancestor of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems built many of the U-boats and battlecruisers that wreaked havoc around the globe during the first and second World Wars, and in recent years the firm has continued to supply the German military with warships.\n\nSo it will have come as a shock to the country's largest shipbuilder that it has been barred from the race to supply the next generation of German battleships. Faced with a program plagued by manufacturing problems, including a new warship that listed, the German defense ministry has taken the unprecedented step of excluding a consortium led by the company, part of the ThyssenKrupp industrial conglomerate, from the bidding process.\n\nThe decision was disclosed in a notice sent to the firm's shipyards by the ministry's purchasing agency. The letter said the government did not trust ThyssenKrupp and its partner, L\u00fcrrsen shipyards, to build the new Multi-role Combat Ship 180 (MKS 180 for short), which is designed to operate anywhere in the world, including in polar seas. The agency also said the consortium\u2019s proposed price of \u20ac4 billion ($4.9 billion) for four warships was too high.\n\nThe decision was a stunning blow to ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, although perhaps not a huge surprise to outsiders. The firm has been forced in recent months to pay multiple fines for cost overruns and late deliveries on other contracts, and has been swept up in a major bribery investigation in Israel, its largest customer, which has ensnared close associates of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTop-Jobs des Tages Jetzt die besten Jobs finden und\n\nper E-Mail benachrichtigt werden. Standort erkennen\n\nThe decision follows an embarrassing comedy of errors involving another new warship being built in ThyssenKrupp's Kiel shipyards, the F125 frigate.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision means the construction of the MKS 180s is likely to go to one of two foreign-owned consortia: Damen Shipyards in Holland or German Naval Yards, which is owned by a French-Lebanese businessman named Iskander Safa. However, officials said that because the final appropriation of money for the ships must go through Germany\u2019s parliament, politicians there could still throw their weight behind the German yard and put the contract out for rebidding. The Ministry of Defense did not comment.\n\nThe procurement agency\u2019s decision follows an embarrassing comedy of errors involving another new warship being built in ThyssenKrupp's Kiel shipyards, the F125 frigate. The first version of the ship, called the FGS Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, was returned by the German navy for repairs to defects after it failed its seagoing trials. The ship had been under construction for six years.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Kieler Nachrichten, the Baden-W\u00fcrttenberg\u2019s central computer system, which was meant to allow the ship to be manned by only half the crew of similar-sized vessels, had failed to function properly. There were also problems with its radar and the ship initially listed to starboard.\n\nThyssenKrupp\u2019s removal from consideration for the MKS 180 contract could cost the company dearly. The deal had been expected to be worth around \u20ac3.5 billion for four ships, plus a likely follow-up order of two more vessels, bringing the total close to \u20ac5 billion.\n\nIn addition, once the German order was finished, the successful bidder would be free to sell the ships to other interested parties. \u201cWhoever receives the contract will also be able to export the MKS 180,\u201d one shipyard manager told Handelsblatt.\n\n02 p23 Strong winds, high waves-01\n\nIt is difficult to determine precisely how the exclusion will affect ThyssenKrupp financially because the firm does not break out separate profit figures for its shipyard division. Bremen-based L\u00fcrssen is a family owned firm and does not disclose results publicly.\n\nThe other bidders also face obstacles, however. For example, the German Naval Yards consortium, which includes Britain's BAE Systems, has never built a ship as big and powerful as the MKS 180, which is said to be the most powerful warship ordered by the navy since the end of World War II.\n\nIt is likely the final decision on the awarding of the contract will be political. It is still not clear who will be defense minister in the cabinet of the new coalition government between Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the Social Democratic Party. But their agreement to form a government stipulated that production of surface ships should become a key domestic technology.\n\nMartin Murphy specializes in the automotive, defense and steel industries for Handelsblatt.

Equipment for the maritime surveillance role includes the Leonardo ATOS (Airborne Tactical Observation and Surveillance) system, Seaspray 7300 radar, identification friend or foe system, Link 11 data link and EOST23 electro-optical sensor.\n\nWith an endurance, or time on station, of more than 5 hours, the Beechcraft 350ERs will be used for a number of roles including maritime surveillance, search and rescue and marine pollution detection.\n\nBoth aircraft will join three AS565 Panthers, which were delivered in 2002 and a dozen Beechcraft 100/200/300/350 aircraft, which will make maintenance easier. The Navy also operates two King Air 350ER which was supplied by Leonardo in July 2016, both aircraft are equipped with the ATOS mission system.\n\nRecently, the Royal Moroccan Navy took delivery of a new 72-meter hydro-oceanographic and multi-missions vessel (BHO2M) named \u201cDAR AL BEIDA\u201d from French shipbuilding company Piriou.\n\nDar al Beida will enable the Royal Moroccan Navy the ability to carry out to carry out in-depth surveys of its waters such as hydrographic surveying for civil and military purposes, understanding the seabed, salinity and temperature of the ocean will help submariners, for example. The Royal Mooccan Navy formerly relied on France to map the seabed in Morocco\u2019s deeper offshore waters since Morocco is a member of the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO)."

Hun Sen has accused the United States of supporting the CNRP and plotting a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d to overthrow his government.\n\nThe opposition party and the United States denied that.\n\nCambodia has suspended joint military exercises with the United States indefinitely, but has held exercises with China twice since 2016."
